Step 1: Remove unnecessary includes

The program includes `<bits/stdc++.h>`, which includes a lot of unnecessary headers. We can remove this line and include only the necessary headers.

Step 2: Remove unnecessary macros

The program defines macros for frequently used code snippets like `pb`, `ld`, `ll`, `print`, `println`, `show`, and `debug`. These macros can be removed as they are not used in the program.

Step 3: Remove redundant code

The program uses the `Time` function to calculate the time taken by the program. However, this function is not called anywhere in the program, so we can remove it.

Step 4: Optimize data structures

The program uses a `multiset`, a `map`, a `set`, and an array `mp` to store and manipulate data. However, these data structures can be simplified and optimized.

- The `multiset` and `map` can be combined into a single `map` to eliminate duplicate values and reduce memory usage.

- The `map` can be replaced with a simple array to improve performance.

- The `set` can be removed as it is not used in the program.

Step 5: Optimize the algorithm

The program uses multiple if conditions and calculations to determine the value of `ans`. However, we can simplify the algorithm to improve performance.

- We can remove the condition `if (cst.size() == 1)` as it is not necessary.

- We can remove the conditions `if (y == 1)` and `if (w == 1)` as they are redundant.

- We can simplify the condition `if (max(f, s) - 1 == min(f, s) || min(f, s) == 1)` to `if (f == s || f == 1 || s == 1)`.

With these optimizations in mind, here is the optimized C++ program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <map>
#include <cstring>
using namespace std;

const int mxN = 1e9 + 5;

void solve() {
    int n;
    cin >> n;
    map<int, int> mp;
    int ans = 0;
    int cnt[mxN];
    memset(cnt, 0, sizeof(cnt));
    
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        int x;
        cin >> x;
        
        if (mp[x]) {
            cnt[mp[x]]--;
        }
        
        mp[x]++;
        cnt[mp[x]]++;
        
        int f = cnt[1];
        int s = cnt[mp[x]];
        int w = cnt[f];
        int y = cnt[s];
        
        if (f * w + s * y == i + 1) {
            if (f == s || f == 1 || s == 1) {
                ans = i;
            }
        }
    }
    
    ans++;
    cout << ans << endl;
}

int main() {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(NULL);
    
    solve();
    
    return 0;
}
```

This optimized program reduces unnecessary includes, removes redundant macros and code, optimizes data structures, and simplifies the algorithm.
