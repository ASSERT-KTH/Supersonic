To optimize this program, we can make the following improvements:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The program includes the entire `<bits/stdc++.h>` library, which is not recommended as it includes a large number of unnecessary headers. We can remove this include statement and include only the required headers.

2. Remove unused macros: The program defines several macros such as `pb`, `ld`, `ll`, `print`, `println`, `show`, and `debug`, but they are not used anywhere in the code. We can remove them to improve readability.

3. Use `unordered_map` instead of `map`: The program uses a `map` to store the count of elements. Since the order of elements does not matter, we can use an `unordered_map` instead, which has a faster average lookup time.

4. Avoid unnecessary set operations: The program uses a `set` to store the distinct elements. However, it only checks the size of the set to determine if all elements are the same. We can avoid the use of the set and directly compare the count of the first and second most frequent elements.

5. Use `endl` instead of `"\n"`: The program uses `"\n"` to output a newline character. However, `endl` can be used instead, which not only outputs a newline character but also flushes the output stream, improving performance.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <set>
#include <cstring>

using namespace std;

const int INF = 1e9 + 7;

void solve() {
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  unordered_map<int, int> mp;
  int ans = 0;
  unordered_map<int, int> cnt;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    int x;
    cin >> x;
    if (mp[x]) {
      cnt[mp[x]]--;
      if (cnt[mp[x]] == 0) {
        cnt.erase(mp[x]);
      }
    }
    mp[x]++;
    cnt[mp[x]]++;
    auto it = cnt.begin();
    int f = it->first;
    int w = it->second;
    ++it;
    int s = it->first;
    int y = it->second;
    if (w == i + 1 && f == 1) {
      ans = i;
    }
    if (f * w + s * y == i + 1) {
      if (y == 1) {
        if (s == 1 || s - 1 == f) {
          ans = i;
        }
      } else if (w == 1) {
        if (f == 1 || f - 1 == s) {
          ans = i;
        }
      } else if (y == 1 && w == 1) {
        if (max(f, s) - 1 == min(f, s) || min(f, s) == 1) {
          ans = i;
        }
      }
    }
  }
  ans++;
  cout << ans << endl;
}

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  cout.tie(NULL);
  cout.precision(35);
  solve();
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized program removes unnecessary includes and macros, uses `unordered_map` instead of `map`, avoids unnecessary set operations, and uses `endl` instead of `"\n"`. These changes improve the program's performance and memory usage.
