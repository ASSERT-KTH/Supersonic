To optimize the given program, I would make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The program includes the entire `bits/stdc++.h` header which is not recommended. Instead, we should include only the necessary headers.

2. Remove unnecessary macros: The program defines several macros that are not used in the code. Removing these macros will improve readability and reduce compilation time.

3. Replace `multiset` with `vector`: The program uses a `multiset` to keep track of the frequency of elements. However, since the elements are integers, we can use a `vector` instead which will be faster and use less memory.

4. Replace `map` with `vector`: The program uses a `map` to keep track of the frequency of frequencies. Again, since the frequencies are integers, we can use a `vector` instead.

5. Remove unnecessary `set`: The program uses a `set` to keep track of the distinct elements. However, this is not necessary as we can calculate the number of distinct elements using the `vector` of frequencies.

6. Simplify the logic to calculate `ans`: The logic to calculate `ans` can be simplified by removing unnecessary conditions and combining some conditions.

7. Remove unnecessary `cout.precision()`: The program sets the precision of `cout` to `35`, which is unnecessary as the output is an integer.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <cstring>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

const int mxN = 1e5 + 5;

void solve() {
    int n;
    cin >> n;
    vector<int> mp(mxN, 0);
    int ans = 0;
    vector<int> cnt(n + 1, 0);
    int distinct = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        int x;
        cin >> x;
        if (mp[x]) {
            cnt[mp[x]]--;
        }
        mp[x]++;
        cnt[mp[x]]++;
        if (cnt[mp[x]] == 1) {
            distinct++;
        }
        if (cnt[mp[x] - 1] == 1) {
            distinct--;
        }
        int f = mp[x], s = mp[x];
        while (cnt[s] == 0) {
            s--;
        }
        int w = cnt[f], y = cnt[s];
        if (distinct == 1 || max(w, y) == i + 1) {
            ans = i;
        }
        if (f * w + s * y == i + 1) {
            if ((y == 1 && (s == 1 || s - 1 == f)) || (w == 1 && (f == 1 || f - 1 == s)) || (y == 1 && w == 1 && (max(f, s) - 1 == min(f, s) || min(f, s) == 1))) {
                ans = i;
            }
        }
    }
    ans++;
    cout << ans << endl;
}

int main() {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(NULL);
    cout.tie(NULL);
    int t;
    solve();
    return 0;
}
```

I hope this optimization helps improve the running time and memory usage of the program. Let me know if you have any further questions!
