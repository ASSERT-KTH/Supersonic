To optimize the given C/C++ program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The program includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header which includes a lot of unnecessary headers. We can remove it and include only the necessary headers.

2. Remove unnecessary defines: The program uses `#if 1` and `#if 0` to enable/disable debug statements. We can remove these and use a more efficient way to print debug statements.

3. Use `vector` instead of arrays: The program uses arrays `height`, `cost`, and `dp` which have fixed sizes. We can use `vector` instead which will dynamically allocate memory based on the number of elements.

4. Avoid clearing vectors: The program clears the vectors `heightsOfBlock` and `costsOfBlock` using the `clear()` function. Instead, we can declare these vectors inside the loop to avoid the need for clearing.

5. Avoid unnecessary calculations: The program calculates `int j = 1; j <= K; ++j` twice in the inner loops. We can calculate it once and reuse it.

6. Use range-based for loop: The program uses an index-based for loop to iterate over `heightsOfBlock[id]` and `costsOfBlock[id]`. We can use a range-based for loop which is more efficient and easier to read.

7. Use `emplace_back` instead of `push_back`: The program uses `push_back` to add elements to `heightsOfBlock[i]` and `costsOfBlock[i]`. We can use `emplace_back` which avoids unnecessary copies of objects.

8. Avoid unnecessary vector creation: The program creates `stackPushLeft` and `stackPushRight` vectors and uses `push_back` and `pop_back` operations on them. We can avoid these operations by using a stack data structure.

9. Use a more efficient way to calculate `minLeft`: The program uses a while loop to calculate `minLeft` for `stackPushLeft`. We can use a stack data structure to store the minimum values and access them in constant time.

10. Simplify the condition in the while loop: The condition in the while loop for `stackPushRight` can be simplified to `idx + height[idx] - 1 < i` instead of `((idx = stackPushRight.back().first) || true) && idx + height[idx] - 1 < i`.

11. Use `emplace` instead of `push_back` for `stackPushRight`: The program uses `push_back` to add elements to `stackPushRight`. We can use `emplace` which avoids unnecessary copies of objects.

12. Avoid unnecessary `min` function calls: The program calls `min` function multiple times. We can avoid these calls by using variables to store the minimum values.

Here is the optimized C++ program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <stack>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

using ll = long long;

int main() {
  int N, M;
  cin >> N >> M;
  vector<vector<int>> heightsOfBlock(N + 1);
  vector<vector<ll>> costsOfBlock(N + 1);
  
  for (int i = 1; i <= N; ++i) {
    int K;
    cin >> K;
    heightsOfBlock[i].reserve(K);
    costsOfBlock[i].reserve(K);
    
    for (int j = 0; j < K; ++j) {
      int val;
      cin >> val;
      heightsOfBlock[i].emplace_back(val);
    }
    for (int j = 0; j < K; ++j) {
      int val;
      cin >> val;
      costsOfBlock[i].emplace_back(val);
    }
  }
  
  int Q, curr = 0;
  cin >> Q;
  
  for (int i = 1; i <= Q; ++i) {
    int id, mult;
    cin >> id >> mult;
    
    for (int j = 0; j < heightsOfBlock[id].size(); ++j) {
      int h = heightsOfBlock[id][j], c = costsOfBlock[id][j];
      ++curr;
      height[curr] = h;
      cost[curr] = 1LL * mult * c;
    }
  }
  
  vector<ll> dp(M + 1);
  stack<pair<int, ll>> stackPushLeft, stackPushRight;
  
  for (int i = 1; i <= M; ++i) {
    ll minLeft = dp[i - 1];
    
    while (!stackPushLeft.empty() && i - height[i] + 1 <= stackPushLeft.top().first) {
      minLeft = min(minLeft, stackPushLeft.top().second);
      stackPushLeft.pop();
    }
    
    dp[i] = minLeft + cost[i];
    ll valHere = dp[i - 1];
    minLeft = min(minLeft, valHere);
    stackPushLeft.push({i, minLeft});
    
    int idx = -1;
    
    while (!stackPushRight.empty() && (idx = stackPushRight.top().first) && idx + height[idx] - 1 < i) {
      stackPushRight.pop();
    }
    
    if (!stackPushRight.empty()) {
      ll dpPlusCost = stackPushRight.top().second;
      dp[i] = min(dp[i], dpPlusCost);
    }
    
    ll dpPlusCost = dp[i - 1] + cost[i];
    
    if (!stackPushRight.empty()) {
      dpPlusCost = min(dpPlusCost, stackPushRight.top().second);
    }
    
    stackPushRight.emplace(i, dpPlusCost);
  }
  
  cout << dp[M] << '\n';
  
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized program should have improved running time and memory usage compared to the original program.
