To optimize the given program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The program includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header, which includes a lot of unnecessary headers. We can remove this line and include only the necessary headers.

2. Remove unnecessary macros: The program defines two macros `pv(x)` and `pn` for debugging purposes. We can remove these macros since they are not used in the program.

3. Replace `using` declarations with specific types: The program uses `using` declarations to define type aliases. Instead of using `using namespace std`, we can replace the `using` declarations with specific types to avoid polluting the global namespace.

4. Use `reserve` for vectors: The program uses vectors `heightsOfBlock` and `costsOfBlock` to store data. We can use the `reserve` function to pre-allocate memory for these vectors, as we know their size in advance.

5. Use `emplace_back` instead of `push_back`: The program uses `push_back` to add elements to the vectors `heightsOfBlock` and `costsOfBlock`. We can use `emplace_back` instead, which constructs the elements in-place, saving unnecessary copies.

6. Remove unnecessary clearing of vectors: After populating the vectors `heightsOfBlock` and `costsOfBlock`, the program clears them using the `clear` function. Since these vectors are no longer needed, we can remove these lines.

7. Use `resize` instead of `push_back` for `height` and `cost` arrays: The program uses arrays `height` and `cost` to store data. Instead of using `push_back` to add elements to these arrays, we can use `resize` to set their size in advance and assign values directly to the elements.

8. Use a single stack for both left and right push: The program uses two stacks `stackPushLeft` and `stackPushRight` to store minimum values. Instead of using two separate stacks, we can use a single stack and keep track of both left and right push values.

9. Remove unnecessary condition in the while loop: The program has an unnecessary condition `|| true` in the while loop. We can remove this condition as it doesn't affect the program logic.

10. Avoid unnecessary assignment of `minLeft` in the while loop: The program assigns `minLeft` to `valHere` in the while loop, which is unnecessary. We can remove this assignment to optimize the loop.

11. Use `emplace_back` instead of `push_back` for `stackPushLeft` and `stackPushRight`: The program uses `push_back` to add elements to `stackPushLeft` and `stackPushRight`. We can use `emplace_back` instead to avoid unnecessary copies.

12. Use `back` instead of `size` to access the last element in the stack: The program uses `size` to access the last element in the stack. We can use `back` instead, which is more efficient.

13. Use `const auto&` for range-based loops: The program uses range-based loops to iterate over vectors. We can use `const auto&` to avoid unnecessary copies.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <utility>
#include <fstream>
using namespace std;

const int NMax = 1e7 + 5;

int main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(nullptr);

  ifstream in("bellmanford.in");
  ofstream out("bellmanford.out");

  int N, M;
  in >> N >> M;
  vector<vector<int>> heightsOfBlock(N + 1);
  vector<vector<ll>> costsOfBlock(N + 1);
  heightsOfBlock.reserve(N + 1);
  costsOfBlock.reserve(N + 1);
  for (int i = 1; i <= N; ++i) {
    int K;
    in >> K;
    heightsOfBlock[i].reserve(K);
    costsOfBlock[i].reserve(K);
    for (int j = 1; j <= K; ++j) {
      int val;
      in >> val;
      heightsOfBlock[i].emplace_back(val);
    }
    for (int j = 1; j <= K; ++j) {
      int val;
      in >> val;
      costsOfBlock[i].emplace_back(val);
    }
  }

  int Q, curr = 0;
  in >> Q;
  vector<int> height(M + 1);
  vector<ll> cost(M + 1);
  for (int i = 1; i <= Q; ++i) {
    int id, mult;
    in >> id >> mult;
    const auto& hBlock = heightsOfBlock[id];
    const auto& cBlock = costsOfBlock[id];
    for (int j = 0; j < (int)hBlock.size(); ++j) {
      height[++curr] = hBlock[j];
      cost[curr] = 1LL * mult * cBlock[j];
    }
  }

  vector<pair<int, ll>> stackPush;
  stackPush.reserve(M + 1);
  vector<ll> dp(M + 1);
  for (int i = 1; i <= M; ++i) {
    ll minLeft = dp[i - 1];
    while (!stackPush.empty() && i - height[i] + 1 <= stackPush.back().first) {
      minLeft = min(minLeft, stackPush.back().second);
      stackPush.pop_back();
    }
    dp[i] = minLeft + cost[i];
    ll minLeftHere = minLeft;
    if (!stackPush.empty()) {
      ll dpPlusCost = stackPush.back().second;
      dp[i] = min(dp[i], dpPlusCost);
    }
    ll dpPlusCost = dp[i - 1] + cost[i];
    if (!stackPush.empty()) {
      dpPlusCost = min(dpPlusCost, stackPush.back().second);
    }
    stackPush.emplace_back(i, dpPlusCost);
  }

  out << dp[M] << '\n';
  return 0;
}
