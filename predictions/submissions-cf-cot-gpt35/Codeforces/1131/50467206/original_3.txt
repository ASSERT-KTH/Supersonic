Step 1: Avoid unnecessary includes
- The program includes `<bits/stdc++.h>`, which is a non-standard header and not necessary for this program. It includes all the standard headers, which can slow down the compilation process.
- Remove the unnecessary include statement.

Step 2: Remove unnecessary macros
- There are macros defined for debugging purposes (`pv(x)` and `pn`).
- Since debugging is not required for optimization, we can remove these macros.

Step 3: Optimize memory usage
- The program uses vectors `heightsOfBlock` and `costsOfBlock` to store the heights and costs of blocks.
- After populating the `heightsOfBlock` and `costsOfBlock` vectors, the program clears them using the `clear()` function.
- Instead of using vectors, we can use arrays with fixed sizes to store the heights and costs of blocks, which will reduce memory usage and potentially improve performance.

Step 4: Optimize loops
- There are two nested loops used to populate the `heightsOfBlock` and `costsOfBlock` vectors.
- Instead of using two separate loops, we can combine them into a single loop to populate the arrays directly.

Step 5: Optimize variable initialization
- The variable `curr` is initialized with 0 and then incremented before using it to index the `height` and `cost` arrays.
- We can initialize `curr` with 1 and remove the increment operation inside the loop.

Step 6: Optimize unnecessary computation
- The condition `((idx = stackPushRight.back().first) || true)` inside the while loop is not necessary and can be removed.

Step 7: Optimize unnecessary checks
- The condition `(int)heightsOfBlock[id].size()` inside the loop can be avoided by using a range-based for loop instead.

Here is the optimized C++ program:
