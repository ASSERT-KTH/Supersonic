To optimize the given C++ program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The program includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header, which is not required. We can remove this include statement.

2. Remove unnecessary using statements: The program includes several unnecessary using statements such as `using uint = unsigned int`, `using ld = long double`, `using pii = pair<int, int>`, etc. We can remove these using statements.

3. Avoid using `vector<vector<int>>` and `vector<vector<ll>>` for storing heights and costs: The program uses `vector<vector<int>>` and `vector<vector<ll>>` to store the heights and costs of each block. Instead of using a 2D vector, we can use a single vector of pairs to store both the height and cost values.

4. Avoid using `vector<pair<int, ll>>` for stackPushLeft and stackPushRight: The program uses `vector<pair<int, ll>>` to store the left and right stack values. Instead of using a vector, we can use two variables to store the top elements of the stacks.

5. Remove unnecessary clearing of vectors: The program clears the vectors `heightsOfBlock` and `costsOfBlock` after processing them. Since these vectors are not used later in the program, we can remove the clearing statements.

6. Avoid using `inf_int` and `inf_ll` constants: The program defines constants `inf_int` and `inf_ll` for representing infinity. Instead of using these constants, we can use `numeric_limits<int>::max()` and `numeric_limits<ll>::max()` functions to get the maximum values for integers and long long integers.

7. Remove unnecessary conditional check in the while loop: The program has a while loop with a conditional check `((idx = stackPushRight.back().first) || true)`. This check is unnecessary and can be removed.

8. Avoid using `pb` function for push_back: The program uses the `pb` function for push_back operations. Instead, we can directly use the `push_back` function.

Here is the optimized C++ program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <limits>
using namespace std;

const int NMax = 1e7 + 5;

int height[NMax];
long long cost[NMax], dp[NMax];

int main() {
    ifstream in("bellmanford.in");
    ofstream out("bellmanford.out");

    int N, M;
    in >> N >> M;
    vector<pair<int, long long>> block(N + 1);
    for (int i = 1; i <= N; ++i) {
        int K;
        in >> K;
        for (int j = 1; j <= K; ++j) {
            int h;
            in >> h;
            block[i].push_back({h, 0});
        }
        for (int j = 1; j <= K; ++j) {
            long long c;
            in >> c;
            block[i][j - 1].second = c;
        }
    }

    int Q, curr = 0;
    in >> Q;
    for (int i = 1; i <= Q; ++i) {
        int id, mult;
        in >> id >> mult;
        for (auto it : block[id]) {
            height[++curr] = it.first;
            cost[curr] = 1LL * mult * it.second;
        }
    }

    block.clear();
    long long stackPushLeft = numeric_limits<long long>::max();
    long long stackPushRight = numeric_limits<long long>::max();
    for (int i = 1; i <= M; ++i) {
        long long minLeft = dp[i - 1];
        while (i - height[i] + 1 <= stackPushLeft) {
            minLeft = min(minLeft, stackPushLeft);
            stackPushLeft = dp[i - height[i]];
        }
        dp[i] = minLeft + cost[i];
        long long valHere = dp[i - 1];
        minLeft = min(minLeft, valHere);
        stackPushLeft = minLeft;

        int idx = -1;
        while ((idx = stackPushRight) && idx + height[idx] - 1 < i) {
            stackPushRight = 0;
        }
        if (stackPushRight) {
            long long dpPlusCost = stackPushRight;
            dp[i] = min(dp[i], dpPlusCost);
        }
        long long dpPlusCost = dp[i - 1] + cost[i];
        if (stackPushRight) {
            dpPlusCost = min(dpPlusCost, stackPushRight);
        }
        stackPushRight = dpPlusCost;
    }

    out << dp[M] << '\n';

    return 0;
}
