The given program calculates the minimum cost to reach the end of a path by considering different blocks with different heights and costs. The program uses dynamic programming to optimize the calculation.

To optimize the program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary headers: The program includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header, which includes a large number of standard library headers. We can remove this line and include only the necessary headers for the program.

2. Avoid unnecessary input/output operations: The program uses `cerr` and `endl` for debugging purposes, which can slow down the execution. We can remove these lines. Additionally, the program uses `ifstream` and `ofstream` for file input/output. Since we are not using file input/output in this optimization, we can remove those lines as well.

3. Avoid unnecessary memory usage: The program uses two separate vectors, `heightsOfBlock` and `costsOfBlock`, to store the heights and costs of each block. We can optimize memory usage by combining these two vectors into a single vector of pairs, where each pair represents the height and cost of a block.

4. Avoid unnecessary clearing of vectors: After populating the `heightsOfBlock` and `costsOfBlock` vectors, the program clears these vectors. Since these vectors are not used later in the program, we can remove the clearing operations.

5. Avoid unnecessary calculations: The program uses two stacks, `stackPushLeft` and `stackPushRight`, to track the minimum costs. However, the logic for pushing and popping elements from these stacks can be simplified. We can remove unnecessary calculations and simplify the logic for updating the minimum costs.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

using ll = long long;

const int NMax = 1e7 + 5;

int height[NMax];
ll cost[NMax], dp[NMax];

int main() {
  int N, M;
  cin >> N >> M;
  
  vector<pair<int, ll>> blocks;
  
  for (int i = 1; i <= N; ++i) {
    int K;
    cin >> K;
    
    for (int j = 1; j <= K; ++j) {
      int val;
      cin >> val;
      int h = val;
      
      cin >> val;
      ll c = val;
      
      blocks.push_back({h, c});
    }
  }
  
  int Q, curr = 0;
  cin >> Q;
  
  for (int i = 1; i <= Q; ++i) {
    int id, mult;
    cin >> id >> mult;
    
    for (const auto& block : blocks) {
      int h = block.first;
      ll c = block.second;
      
      height[++curr] = h;
      cost[curr] = 1LL * mult * c;
    }
  }
  
  vector<pair<int, ll>> stackPushLeft, stackPushRight;
  
  for (int i = 1; i <= M; ++i) {
    ll minLeft = dp[i - 1];
    
    while (!stackPushLeft.empty() && i - height[i] + 1 <= stackPushLeft.back().first) {
      minLeft = min(minLeft, stackPushLeft.back().second);
      stackPushLeft.pop_back();
    }
    
    dp[i] = minLeft + cost[i];
    
    ll valHere = dp[i - 1];
    minLeft = min(minLeft, valHere);
    stackPushLeft.push_back({i, minLeft});
    
    int idx = -1;
    
    while (!stackPushRight.empty() &&
           ((idx = stackPushRight.back().first) || true) &&
           idx + height[idx] - 1 < i) {
      stackPushRight.pop_back();
    }
    
    if (!stackPushRight.empty()) {
      ll dpPlusCost = stackPushRight.back().second;
      dp[i] = min(dp[i], dpPlusCost);
    }
    
    ll dpPlusCost = dp[i - 1] + cost[i];
    
    if (!stackPushRight.empty()) {
      dpPlusCost = min(dpPlusCost, stackPushRight.back().second);
    }
    
    stackPushRight.push_back({i, dpPlusCost});
  }
  
  cout << dp[M] << '\n';
  
  return 0;
}
```

Explanation of the optimization steps:

1. Removed unnecessary headers: Removed the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header and included only the necessary headers for the program.

2. Avoided unnecessary input/output operations: Removed the debugging output lines (`cerr` and `endl`) and the file input/output related code.

3. Avoided unnecessary memory usage: Combined the `heightsOfBlock` and `costsOfBlock` vectors into a single vector of pairs (`blocks`).

4. Avoided unnecessary clearing of vectors: Removed the clearing operations for `heightsOfBlock` and `costsOfBlock`.

5. Avoided unnecessary calculations: Simplified the logic for pushing and popping elements from `stackPushLeft` and `stackPushRight` stacks, removing unnecessary calculations.
