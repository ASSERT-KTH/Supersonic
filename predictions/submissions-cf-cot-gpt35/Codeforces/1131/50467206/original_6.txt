Step 1: Remove unnecessary includes and macros
- The `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` includes a large number of standard C++ library headers, which may not be necessary for this program. It is better to include only the necessary headers.
- The `#if 1` and `#else` blocks are not needed and can be removed.
- The `#ifdef INFOARENA` and `#else` blocks can be replaced with `ifstream in("bellmanford.in"); ofstream out("bellmanford.out");` to directly open the input and output files.
- The `pv` and `pn` macros are used for debugging purposes and can be removed.

Step 2: Optimize memory usage
- The `heightsOfBlock` and `costsOfBlock` vectors are used to store the heights and costs of blocks. These vectors can be replaced with a single vector of pairs to store both height and cost.
- The `height` and `cost` arrays can be replaced with a single vector of pairs to store both height and cost.
- The `stackPushLeft` and `stackPushRight` vectors can be replaced with a single vector of pairs to store both index and value.

Step 3: Optimize runtime
- The `heightsOfBlock.clear()` and `costsOfBlock.clear()` calls are unnecessary and can be removed.

Step 4: Other optimizations
- The `stackPushRight.size()` check in the `while` loop condition is always true. It can be removed.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

using ll = long long;

const int NMax = 1e7 + 5;

int main() {
  ifstream in("bellmanford.in");
  ofstream out("bellmanford.out");

  int N, M;
  in >> N >> M;
  vector<vector<pair<int, ll>>> blockData(N + 1);
  for (int i = 1; i <= N; ++i) {
    int K;
    in >> K;
    for (int j = 1; j <= K; ++j) {
      int height, cost;
      in >> height >> cost;
      blockData[i].push_back({height, 1LL * cost});
    }
  }
  int Q, curr = 0;
  in >> Q;
  for (int i = 1; i <= Q; ++i) {
    int id, mult;
    in >> id >> mult;
    for (const auto& block : blockData[id]) {
      int h = block.first;
      ll c = block.second;
      ++curr;
      height[curr] = h;
      cost[curr] = 1LL * mult * c;
    }
  }

  vector<pair<int, ll>> stackPushLeft, stackPushRight;
  for (int i = 1; i <= M; ++i) {
    ll minLeft = dp[i - 1];
    while (!stackPushLeft.empty() && i - height[i] + 1 <= stackPushLeft.back().first) {
      minLeft = min(minLeft, stackPushLeft.back().second);
      stackPushLeft.pop_back();
    }
    dp[i] = minLeft + cost[i];
    ll valHere = dp[i - 1];
    minLeft = min(minLeft, valHere);
    stackPushLeft.push_back({i, minLeft});
    int idx = -1;
    while (!stackPushRight.empty() && (idx = stackPushRight.back().first) && idx + height[idx] - 1 < i) {
      stackPushRight.pop_back();
    }
    if (!stackPushRight.empty()) {
      ll dpPlusCost = stackPushRight.back().second;
      dp[i] = min(dp[i], dpPlusCost);
    }
    ll dpPlusCost = dp[i - 1] + cost[i];
    if (!stackPushRight.empty()) {
      dpPlusCost = min(dpPlusCost, stackPushRight.back().second);
    }
    stackPushRight.push_back({i, dpPlusCost});
  }

  out << dp[M] << '\n';
  return 0;
}
```
