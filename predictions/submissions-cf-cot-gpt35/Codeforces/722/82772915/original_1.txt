The given program has several optimization opportunities:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The program includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header, which is not a standard C++ header and may include unnecessary libraries. We can remove this include and include only the necessary headers.

2. Remove unused macros: The program defines several macros that are not used in the code. We can remove these macros to simplify the code.

3. Remove unnecessary functions: The program defines several functions that are not used in the code. We can remove these functions to reduce memory usage.

4. Simplify the code: The code uses complex macros and functions that make it difficult to read and understand. We can simplify the code by removing unnecessary macros and using simpler constructs.

Based on these optimization opportunities, here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

const int N = 5e5 + 7;

vector<int> a(N), q(N), par(N), sum(N), fk(N);
int ans;

int root(int v) {
  return par[v] < 0 ? v : (par[v] = root(par[v]));
}

void merge(int x, int y) {
  if ((x = root(x)) == (y = root(y)))
    return;
  ans = max(ans, sum[x] + sum[y]);
  if (par[y] < par[x])
    swap(x, y);
  par[x] += par[y];
  par[y] = x;
  sum[x] += sum[y];
}

void run() {
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  a.resize(n + 1);
  sum.resize(n + 1);
  q.resize(n + 1);
  par.resize(n + 1);
  fk.resize(n + 1);
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
    cin >> a[i];
    sum[i] = a[i];
    par[i] = -1;
  }
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i)
    cin >> q[i];
  
  ans = 0;
  for (int i = n; i >= 1; --i) {
    fk[i] = ans;
    ans = max(ans, a[q[i]]);
    if (q[i] > 1 && a[q[i] - 1])
      merge(q[i], q[i] - 1);
    if (q[i] < n && a[q[i] + 1])
      merge(q[i], q[i] + 1);
  }
  
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i)
    cout << fk[i] << endl;
}

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(nullptr);
  cout.tie(nullptr);
  
  int tc = 1;
  while (tc--)
    run();
  
  return 0;
}
```

Explanation of optimizations:

1. Removed unnecessary includes: The program only needs `<iostream>`, `<vector>`, and `<algorithm>` headers. The `<bits/stdc++.h>` header is not necessary and may include unnecessary libraries.

2. Removed unused macros: The program had several macros that were not used in the code. These macros were removed to simplify the code.

3. Removed unnecessary functions: The program had several functions that were not used in the code. These functions were removed to reduce memory usage.

4. Simplified the code: The code used complex macros and functions that made it difficult to read and understand. The code was simplified by removing unnecessary macros and using simpler constructs.
