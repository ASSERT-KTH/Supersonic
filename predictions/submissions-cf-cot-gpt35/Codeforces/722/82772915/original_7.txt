The given program is a C++ program that solves a specific problem. However, the program is not optimized and can be improved for running time and memory usage.

Here are the steps to optimize the program:

1. Remove unnecessary header files: The program includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header file, which includes a lot of other header files. This can increase the compilation time and unnecessary bloat the code. We can replace it with only the necessary header files, such as `<iostream>` and `<vector>`.

2. Remove unnecessary macros: The program defines many macros that are not used in the code. These macros increase the code size and reduce readability. We can remove the unused macros to simplify the code.

3. Avoid using `using namespace std;`: The program uses the `using namespace std;` directive, which brings all names from the `std` namespace into the global namespace. This can lead to naming conflicts and reduce code maintainability. It is better to avoid using this directive and qualify the names with the `std` namespace explicitly.

4. Avoid using `endl` for line breaks: The program uses `endl` to insert a line break, but it also flushes the output buffer each time, which can be expensive. We can use the `'\n'` character instead, which only inserts a line break without flushing the buffer.

5. Avoid unnecessary function templates: The program defines some function templates (`gcd`, `powm`, etc.) that are not used in the code. We can remove these function templates to reduce code size.

6. Avoid unnecessary global variables: The program declares many global variables that are not used outside of the `run` function. We can move these variables inside the `run` function to reduce the scope and improve code readability.

7. Avoid unnecessary arrays and fill operations: The program declares and fills some arrays (`a`, `vis`, `sum`, `fk`, `q`) with default values. However, these arrays are not used outside of the `run` function. We can remove the unnecessary arrays and fill operations to reduce memory usage.

8. Optimize the `root` function: The `root` function uses path compression to find the root of a tree. However, it can be optimized further by using a recursive approach instead of a loop. This can reduce the running time of the function.

9. Optimize the `merge` function: The `merge` function merges two disjoint sets and updates the maximum sum. Currently, it checks if the two elements are already in the same set using `root` function. We can optimize this by comparing the root values directly, which can reduce the running time of the function.

10. Optimize the loop in the `run` function: The loop in the `run` function can be optimized by iterating in reverse order. This can avoid unnecessary merging operations and improve the running time of the program.

Here is the optimized C++ program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

const int N = 5e5 + 7;

int par[N];
int sum[N];

int root(int v) {
    return par[v] < 0 ? v : (par[v] = root(par[v]));
}

void merge(int x, int y, int& ans) {
    if ((x = root(x)) == (y = root(y)))
        return;
    ans = std::max(ans, sum[x] + sum[y]);
    if (par[y] < par[x])
        std::swap(x, y);
    par[x] += par[y];
    par[y] = x;
    sum[x] += sum[y];
}

void run() {
    int n;
    std::cin >> n;

    std::vector<int> a(n + 1);
    std::vector<int> q(n + 1);
    std::vector<int> fk(n + 1);
    std::vector<int> vis(n + 1, 0);

    for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
        std::cin >> a[i];
        sum[i] = a[i];
        par[i] = -1;
    }

    for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
        std::cin >> q[i];
    }

    int ans = 0;
    for (int i = n; i >= 1; --i) {
        fk[i] = ans;
        vis[q[i]] = 1;
        ans = std::max(ans, a[q[i]]);
        if (vis[q[i] - 1])
            merge(q[i], q[i] - 1, ans);
        if (vis[q[i] + 1])
            merge(q[i], q[i] + 1, ans);
    }

    for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
        std::cout << fk[i] << '\n';
    }
}

int main() {
    std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    std::cin.tie(nullptr);
    std::cout.tie(nullptr);
    
    int tc = 1;
    for (int i = 0; i < tc; ++i) {
        run();
    }
    return 0;
}
```

This optimized program removes unnecessary code, reduces memory usage, and improves running time by optimizing the root and merge functions.
