To optimize the given program, we can make the following changes:

1. Remove the unnecessary `using namespace std;` line.

2. Instead of iterating from 0 to 4000 for `A` and `B`, we can calculate their upper limit based on the given input values `n`, `a`, and `b`. This will reduce the number of iterations and improve the running time.

3. Instead of calculating `C` in each iteration, we can calculate it once before the inner loop and then update it using the formula `C = (n - (A * a + B * b)) / c`. This will reduce the number of calculations and improve the running time.

4. Instead of checking the condition `(n - (A * a + B * b)) % c == 0` in each iteration, we can check it once before entering the inner loop. If the condition is not satisfied, we can skip the current `B` iteration. This will reduce unnecessary calculations and improve the running time.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  int n, a, b, c;
  std::cin >> n >> a >> b >> c;
  int ans = 0;
  int maxA = n / a;
  int maxB = n / b;
  for (int A = 0; A <= maxA; A++) {
    int remaining = n - (A * a);
    if (remaining % b == 0) {
      int B = remaining / b;
      int C = (n - (A * a + B * b)) / c;
      if (C >= 0 && (n - (A * a + B * b)) % c == 0) {
        ans = std::max(ans, A + B + C);
      }
    }
  }
  std::cout << ans << std::endl;
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized program reduces unnecessary calculations and iterations, improving the running time.
