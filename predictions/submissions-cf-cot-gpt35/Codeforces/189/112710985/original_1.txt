The given program calculates the maximum possible sum of three integers A, B, and C, such that the equation n = A*a + B*b + C*c holds true. The program iterates over all possible values of A, B, and C, and checks if the equation is satisfied. If it is, the sum A + B + C is updated if it is greater than the current maximum.

To optimize this program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Instead of iterating over all possible values of A, B, and C in separate loops, we can combine them into a single loop. This will reduce the number of iterations from 4001*4001*4001 to 4001^3, resulting in a significant reduction in running time.

2. We can calculate the maximum possible values of A and B that satisfy the equation n = A*a + B*b. We can then use these maximum values to calculate the minimum possible value of C. This will reduce the number of iterations required to check the equation.

3. We can initialize the variable "ans" to a negative value, as the maximum sum of A, B, and C can be negative if the equation cannot be satisfied. This will ensure that "ans" is updated correctly.

Based on these optimizations, here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

void Max(int a[], int b[], int n, int memory_lost);

int main() {
  int n, a, b, c;
  cin >> n >> a >> b >> c;
  
  int maxA = n / a;
  int maxB = n / b;
  
  int minC = max(0, (n - (maxA * a + maxB * b)) / c);
  
  int ans = -1;
  
  for (int A = 0; A <= maxA; A++) {
    for (int B = 0; B <= maxB; B++) {
      int C = (n - (A * a + B * b)) / c;
      if (C >= minC && (n - (A * a + B * b)) % c == 0) {
        ans = max(ans, A + B + C);
      }
    }
  }
  
  cout << ans << endl;
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized code reduces the number of iterations required to check the equation, resulting in improved running time. Additionally, it avoids unnecessary calculations by determining the maximum possible values of A and B beforehand.
