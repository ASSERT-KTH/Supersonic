Explanation:

The given program calculates the maximum value of A + B + C, where A, B, and C are non-negative integers, and n is a given integer. The values of A, B, and C are obtained by iterating through all possible values of A and B and calculating the corresponding value of C. The program then checks if the obtained value of C is non-negative and if the expression (n - (A * a + B * b)) % c is equal to 0.

To optimize this program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary variables: The variables a, b, and c are not used in the program. We can remove them.

2. Optimize the loop bounds: The current loop bounds for A and B are from 0 to 4000. However, since A, B, and C are non-negative integers, we can optimize the loop bounds to be from 0 to n/a and n/b, respectively.

3. Optimize the calculation of C: Instead of calculating C using the formula (n - (A * a + B * b)) / c, we can calculate it using the formula (n - A * a - B * b) / c. This avoids unnecessary multiplication operations.

4. Optimize the condition check: Instead of checking if the expression (n - (A * a + B * b)) % c is equal to 0, we can check if the expression (n - A * a - B * b) % c is equal to 0. This avoids unnecessary multiplication operations.

5. Use a variable to store the maximum value: Instead of calling the max function in every iteration, we can use a variable to store the maximum value found so far and update it if a larger value is found.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

void Max(int a[], int b[], int n, int memory_lost);

int main() {
  int n, ans = 0;
  cin >> n;
  
  for (int A = 0; A <= n / a; A++) {
    for (int B = 0; B <= n / b; B++) {
      int C = (n - A * a - B * b) / c;
      if (C >= 0 && (n - A * a - B * b) % c == 0) {
        ans = A + B + C > ans ? A + B + C : ans;
      }
    }
  }
  
  cout << ans << endl;
  return 0;
}
```
