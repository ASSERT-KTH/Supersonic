Explanation of the optimization steps:

1. Remove unnecessary variables: The variables `a`, `b`, and `c` are not used in the program, so we can remove them.

2. Use a more efficient loop range: The loops for `A` and `B` currently iterate up to 4000, but we can optimize this by iterating up to the maximum possible value of `A` or `B` based on the input `n` and the maximum possible values of `a` and `b`. This reduces the number of iterations and improves the running time.

3. Avoid redundant calculations: In the inner loop, the calculation `n - (A * a + B * b)` is performed twice. We can store this value in a variable and reuse it.

4. Use a more efficient condition: Instead of checking `(n - (A * a + B * b)) % c == 0`, we can simplify it to `(n - (A * a + B * b)) % c == 0 && (n - (A * a + B * b)) >= 0`. This eliminates the need to calculate `C` separately.

5. Use `+=` instead of `max()`: Instead of using the `max()` function to update `ans`, we can use `+=` to directly add `A + B + C` to `ans`.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  
  int ans = 0;
  for (int A = 0; A <= n; A++) {
    for (int B = 0; B <= n; B++) {
      int remaining = n - (A + B);
      if (remaining >= 0 && remaining % 3 == 0) {
        int C = remaining / 3;
        ans += A + B + C;
      }
    }
  }
  
  cout << ans << endl;
  return 0;
}
```
