The given program calculates the maximum value of A + B + C, where A, B, and C are non-negative integers, and they satisfy the equation n = A*a + B*b + C*c, where a, b, and c are given constants.

To optimize this program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Reduce the search space: Currently, the program iterates from 0 to 4000 for both A and B, resulting in a large number of unnecessary iterations. We can optimize this by reducing the search space for A and B based on the given equation.

2. Eliminate unnecessary calculations: The program calculates (n - (A * a + B * b)) twice, which can be avoided by storing the result in a variable.

3. Early termination: Once we find a valid solution (C >= 0 and (n - (A * a + B * b)) % c == 0), we can terminate the inner loop and move to the next value of A.

Here is the optimized C++ program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

void Max(int a[], int b[], int n, int memory_lost);

int main() {
  int n, a, b, c;
  cin >> n >> a >> b >> c;
  int ans = 0;
  for (int A = 0; A <= n / a; A++) {
    int remaining = n - (A * a);
    if (remaining % b == 0) {
      int B = remaining / b;
      int C = (n - (A * a + B * b)) / c;
      if (C >= 0 && (n - (A * a + B * b)) % c == 0) {
        ans = A + B + C;
        break;
      }
    }
  }
  cout << ans << endl;
  return 0;
}
```

Explanation of optimizations:

1. The loop for A now goes from 0 to n / a, as any value of A greater than n / a will result in (A * a) being greater than n, making the equation unsatisfiable.

2. We calculate the remaining value after subtracting A * a from n and check if it is divisible by b. If it is, we calculate B as remaining / b.

3. We calculate C as (n - (A * a + B * b)) / c. If C is non-negative and the remaining value after subtracting A * a and B * b is divisible by c, we have found a valid solution. We update the answer and break out of the loop.

These optimizations reduce unnecessary iterations and eliminate redundant calculations, resulting in improved runtime performance.
