The given program finds the maximum value of A + B + C where A, B, and C are non-negative integers, and satisfy the equation n = A * a + B * b + C * c.

To optimize this program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Rather than iterating A and B from 0 to 4000, we can iterate them from 0 to n/a and n/b respectively. This is because if A or B exceeds n/a or n/b respectively, the equation n = A * a + B * b + C * c cannot hold true.

2. Instead of calculating C using the equation C = (n - (A * a + B * b)) / c, we can calculate it directly as C = (n - (A * a + B * b)) / c. This is because if the remainder of (n - (A * a + B * b)) divided by c is not zero, then C cannot be an integer.

3. We can optimize the calculation of (n - (A * a + B * b)) % c by storing it in a variable and reusing it in the condition check. This way, we avoid calculating it twice.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

void Max(int a[], int b[], int n, int memory_lost);

int main() {
  int n, a, b, c;
  cin >> n >> a >> b >> c;
  int ans = 0;
  
  int maxA = n / a;
  int maxB = n / b;

  for (int A = 0; A <= maxA; A++) {
    for (int B = 0; B <= maxB; B++) {
      int remaining = n - (A * a + B * b);
      if (remaining % c == 0) {
        int C = remaining / c;
        ans = max(ans, A + B + C);
      }
    }
  }

  cout << ans << endl;
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized program reduces unnecessary iterations and avoids redundant calculations, resulting in improved running time and memory usage.
