Step 1: Remove unnecessary includes and using directives.
- The program includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header, which is not a standard C++ header and may lead to portability issues. It is better to include the necessary headers individually.
- The program also includes the `using namespace std` directive, which can lead to naming conflicts and make the code less readable. It is better to use the `std::` prefix for standard library entities.

Step 2: Remove unnecessary type aliases and macros.
- The program defines `typedef`s for `pair<int, int>`, `long long int`, and `int64_t`. These aliases are not used in the code and can be safely removed.
- The program defines macros for input and output operations (`sf`, `sfl`, `pb`). These macros are not used in the code and can be safely removed.

Step 3: Optimize the KMP algorithm.
- Instead of using a vector to store the longest proper prefix which is also a suffix (lps) array, we can use a simple integer variable to keep track of the longest prefix length. This will save memory and improve performance.

Step 4: Optimize the longest prefix and suffix palindrome function.
- Instead of reversing the string and concatenating it with "?" to find the longest palindrome, we can use two pointers to compare characters from the start and end of the string. This will eliminate the need for reversing and concatenation, resulting in improved performance.

Step 5: Optimize the main function.
- Instead of using `cin` for reading the number of test cases and the input strings, we can use `scanf` which is generally faster for input operations.

Here's the optimized C++ program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

int kmp(const std::string& s) {
  int lps = 0;
  for (int i = 1; i < s.size(); i++) {
    int previous_index = lps;
    while (previous_index > 0 && s[i] != s[previous_index]) {
      previous_index = lps[previous_index - 1];
    }
    lps = previous_index + (s[i] == s[previous_index] ? 1 : 0);
  }
  return lps;
}

std::string longestPrefixSuffixPalindrome(const std::string& s) {
  int length = 0;
  int n = s.size();
  int i = 0, j = n - 1;
  while (i < j && s[i] == s[j]) {
    length++;
    i++;
    j--;
  }
  std::string ans = s.substr(0, length);
  std::string remaining = s.substr(length, (n - (2 * length)));
  if (!remaining.empty()) {
    int longest_prefix = kmp(remaining);
    std::string reversed_remaining = remaining;
    std::reverse(reversed_remaining.begin(), reversed_remaining.end());
    int longest_suffix = kmp(reversed_remaining);
    if (longest_prefix > longest_suffix) {
      ans += remaining.substr(0, longest_prefix);
    } else {
      ans += reversed_remaining.substr(0, longest_suffix);
    }
  }
  ans += s.substr(n - length, length);
  return ans;
}

int main() {
  int t;
  std::cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    std::string str;
    std::cin >> str;
    std::string ans = longestPrefixSuffixPalindrome(str);
    std::cout << ans << std::endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```
