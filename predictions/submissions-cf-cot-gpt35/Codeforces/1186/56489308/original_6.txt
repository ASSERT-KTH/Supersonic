**Step 1: Avoid unnecessary includes**

The `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` is a non-standard header file that includes all the standard library headers. This can lead to slower compilation times and increased memory usage. We should include only the necessary headers instead.

**Step 2: Remove unused typedefs and using statements**

The `typedef` for `ll` and `pi` are not used in the program. We can remove them to simplify the code. Similarly, the `using namespace std;` statement is not needed since we can qualify the standard library types and functions with the `std::` prefix.

**Step 3: Avoid unnecessary precision setting**

The line `cout.precision(20);` sets the precision of the output stream to 20 digits. However, the program does not require such high precision. We can remove this line to improve efficiency.

**Step 4: Avoid unnecessary type conversions**

The variable `rem` is declared as `ll` (long long) and is assigned the rounded value of `tot` using `llround()`. However, we can directly assign the rounded value of `tot` to `rem` without the need for type conversion.

**Step 5: Optimize loop conditions**

The loop conditions `abs(floor(a[i]) - a[i]) < tol` and `abs(floor(a[i]) - a[i]) > tol` are evaluated for each iteration of the loop. We can optimize this by storing `floor(a[i])` in a separate variable and using it in the loop conditions.

**Step 6: Avoid unnecessary `cerr` output**

The line `cerr << "rem " << rem << endl;` prints the value of `rem` to the standard error stream. Since this output is not required for the program, we can remove this line to improve efficiency.

**Step 7: Optimize output loop**

The output loop can be optimized by directly rounding and printing the values of `a[i]` instead of using `round(floor(a[i]))`. This avoids unnecessary function calls.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <cmath>

int main() {
  std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  std::cin.tie(NULL);

  int n;
  std::cin >> n;
  std::vector<double> a(n);
  double tol = 1.e-7;
  int ent = 0;
  double tot = 0.;

  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    std::cin >> a[i];
    double floor_a = std::floor(a[i]);
    if (std::abs(floor_a - a[i]) < tol) {
      ent++;
    }
    tot += floor_a;
  }

  int rem = std::round(tot);

  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    if (rem < 0 and std::abs(std::floor(a[i]) - a[i]) > tol) {
      std::cout << std::round(a[i]) + 1 << "\n";
      rem++;
    } else {
      std::cout << std::round(a[i]) << "\n";
    }
  }
}
```
