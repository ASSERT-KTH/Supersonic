Optimization Step 1: Remove unnecessary includes and typedefs

The program includes `<bits/stdc++.h>` which is a non-standard header file and includes unnecessary standard library headers. We can remove this include and only include the necessary headers `<iostream>`, `<vector>`, `<cmath>`, and `<algorithm>`. Additionally, the typedefs `ll` and `pi` are not used in the program and can be removed.

Optimization Step 2: Use `'\n'` instead of `"\n"` for newline character

The program uses `"\n"` for newline characters, which is a null-terminated string. Using `'\n'` instead will avoid unnecessary memory allocation for a string.

Optimization Step 3: Use pre-increment instead of post-increment

The program uses post-increment `i++` in the for loops. Pre-increment `++i` is generally faster than post-increment because it does not require a temporary copy of the variable. We can use pre-increment instead.

Optimization Step 4: Use `reserve` function for vector

The program creates a vector `a` without specifying its size. This may result in frequent memory re-allocations and copies as elements are added to the vector. We can use the `reserve` function to allocate memory for `n` elements in advance.

Optimization Step 5: Remove unnecessary `cerr` output

The program uses `cerr` to output the value of `rem` for debugging purposes. We can remove this output as it is not necessary for the final program.

Optimization Step 6: Combine conditions for `rem < 0` and `abs(floor(a[i]) - a[i]) > tol`

The program checks two conditions `rem < 0` and `abs(floor(a[i]) - a[i]) > tol` separately in the second for loop. We can combine these conditions using logical AND `&&` operator for better performance.

Optimization Step 7: Avoid repeated calculation of `floor(a[i])`

The program calculates `floor(a[i])` twice in the second for loop. We can calculate it once and store the result in a variable to avoid redundant calculations.

Here is the optimized C++ program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <cmath>
#include <algorithm>

int main() {
  std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  std::cin.tie(NULL);
  std::cout.precision(20);

  int n;
  std::cin >> n;
  std::vector<double> a;
  a.reserve(n);

  double tol = 1.e-7;
  int ent = 0;
  double tot = 0.;

  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    double value;
    std::cin >> value;
    a.push_back(value);

    if (std::abs(std::floor(value) - value) < tol) {
      ++ent;
    }
    tot += std::floor(value);
  }

  long long rem = std::llround(tot);

  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    double floor_value = std::floor(a[i]);
    if (rem < 0 && std::abs(floor_value - a[i]) > tol) {
      std::cout << std::round(floor_value) + 1 << '\n';
      ++rem;
    } else {
      std::cout << std::round(floor_value) << '\n';
    }
  }

  return 0;
}
```
