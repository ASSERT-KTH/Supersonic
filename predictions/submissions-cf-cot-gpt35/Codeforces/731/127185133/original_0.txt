The given program reads an integer `n`, then reads `n` integers into an array `a`. It then checks if there are any odd numbers in the array such that the next number is zero or it is the last number in the array. If such a number is found, it decrements the next number by one. Finally, it prints "YES" if the flag is still 1, otherwise it prints "NO".

To optimize the program, we can make the following modifications:
1. Remove the unnecessary `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` as it includes all the standard libraries, which is not needed in this program.
2. Change the array `a` to a vector, as it will allow for dynamic resizing and better memory management.
3. Optimize the loop by breaking it early if an odd number followed by zero or the last number is found. This will reduce unnecessary iterations in the loop.

Here is the optimized C++ program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  vector<int> a(n);
  int flag = 1;

  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    cin >> a[i];

  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    if (a[i] & 1) {
      if (a[i + 1] == 0 || i == n - 1) {
        flag = 0;
        break;
      }
      a[i + 1]--;
    }
  }

  cout << (flag ? "YES" : "NO") << "\n";
  return 0;
}
```

Explanation of the optimizations:
1. We removed the unnecessary `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` as it includes all standard libraries, which is not needed in this program. It is better to only include the necessary headers.
2. We changed the array `a` to a vector. This allows for dynamic resizing and better memory management. Vectors are more flexible and efficient in terms of memory usage compared to arrays.
3. In the loop, we added a condition to break the loop early if an odd number followed by zero or the last number is found. This reduces unnecessary iterations in the loop and improves the performance of the program.
