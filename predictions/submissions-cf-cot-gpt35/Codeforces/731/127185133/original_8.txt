To optimize the given program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove the unnecessary include statement for the entire `bits/stdc++.h` library. Instead, include only the required headers, such as `<iostream>`.
2. Avoid using the `std` namespace for the entire program. Instead, use the `std::` prefix for specific standard library functions and types.
3. Change the array `a` from a variable length array (VLA) to a dynamically allocated array to reduce memory usage.
4. Avoid unnecessary branching and use a single loop to iterate through the array and check for the required conditions.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  int n;
  std::cin >> n;

  int* a = new int[n];
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    std::cin >> a[i];

  bool flag = true;
  for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
    if (a[i] % 2 != 0) {
      if (a[i + 1] == 0) {
        flag = false;
        break;
      }
      a[i + 1]--;
    }
  }

  std::cout << (flag ? "YES" : "NO") << "\n";

  delete[] a;
}
```

Explanation of optimizations:
1. Removing the unnecessary include statement reduces the compilation time and makes the code cleaner.
2. Avoiding the `std` namespace reduces the chances of naming conflicts and makes the code more readable.
3. Changing the array `a` to a dynamically allocated array reduces the memory usage as variable length arrays (VLAs) are not recommended in modern C++.
4. Using a single loop instead of two loops reduces the number of iterations, resulting in faster execution. Additionally, checking for odd numbers using the modulus operator (`%`) is faster than using bitwise AND (`&`).
5. Checking for the condition `i == n - 1` within the loop is unnecessary and can be avoided by changing the loop condition to `i < n - 1`.

Overall, these modifications optimize the program for both running time and memory usage.
