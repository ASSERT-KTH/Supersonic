Step 1: Remove unnecessary header file inclusion.
The `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` header file includes a large number of standard C++ library headers, which can slow down the compilation process. Since we are not using any specific header file from the included library, we can remove this line.

Step 2: Optimize input/output operations.
The standard input and output operations (`cin` and `cout`) can be slower compared to other input/output methods. We can optimize this by using `scanf` and `printf` functions instead.

Step 3: Optimize the loop conditions.
The second loop can be optimized by changing the loop condition from `i < n` to `i < n-1`. This is because inside the loop, we are accessing `a[i+1]`, so we need to stop one element before the last element to avoid going out of bounds.

Step 4: Merge the conditions in the if statement.
The if statement inside the second loop can be simplified by merging the conditions `a[i + 1] == 0` and `i == n - 1` using the logical OR operator (`||`).

Step 5: Remove unnecessary else statement.
Since the if statement inside the second loop contains a break statement, we can remove the else statement as it will never be reached.

Here is the optimized C++ program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int n;
  scanf("%d", &n);

  int i, a[n], flag = 1;
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++)
    scanf("%d", &a[i]);

  for (i = 0; i < n-1; i++) {
    if (a[i] & 1) {
      if (a[i + 1] == 0 || i == n - 2) {
        flag = 0;
        break;
      }
      a[i + 1]--;
    }
  }

  printf("%s\n", (flag ? "YES" : "NO"));

  return 0;
}
```
