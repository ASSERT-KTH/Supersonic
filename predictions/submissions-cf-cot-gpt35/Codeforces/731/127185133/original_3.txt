Step 1: Remove unnecessary include statement
- The `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` is not needed as it includes the entire C++ standard library, which is unnecessary for this program.

Step 2: Optimize the input reading
- Instead of using `cin` for each element in the array, we can use `scanf` which is faster.
- We can also avoid using an array and directly process the input while reading, reducing memory usage.

Step 3: Optimize the loop
- We can combine the two loops into a single loop to avoid iterating over the array twice.
- We can use a `while` loop instead of a `for` loop to avoid checking the condition for each iteration.

Step 4: Remove unnecessary check in the loop
- The condition `i == n - 1` is unnecessary as it will be covered by the condition `a[i + 1] == 0`.

Step 5: Optimize the output
- Instead of using `cout`, we can use `printf` which is faster.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int n;
  scanf("%d", &n);

  int flag = 1;
  int a, prev = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    scanf("%d", &a);
    if (a & 1) {
      if (prev == 0) {
        flag = 0;
        break;
      } else {
        prev--;
      }
    } else {
      prev = a;
    }
  }

  printf("%s\n", flag ? "YES" : "NO");
}
```
