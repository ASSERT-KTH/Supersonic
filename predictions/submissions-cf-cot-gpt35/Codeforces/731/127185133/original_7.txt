Explanation of the optimization steps:

1. Remove unnecessary header file inclusion: The `<bits/stdc++.h>` header file includes a large number of standard library headers, which can increase the compilation time and memory usage. In this program, only `<iostream>` is needed, so we can remove the unnecessary inclusion.

2. Change the array declaration: The array `a` is declared with a variable size `n`, which is not supported by standard C++. Instead, we can use a dynamic array by using the `new` operator.

3. Optimize the loop condition: The loop condition `i < n` is checked twice in both loop iterations. We can optimize this by changing the loop condition to `i < n-1` and accessing `a[i+1]` directly. This avoids the unnecessary check in the last iteration.

4. Remove unnecessary conditional check: In the inner loop, there is a conditional check `a[i + 1] == 0 or i == n - 1`. Since we have optimized the loop condition, `i` will never reach `n-1`, so we can remove the `i == n - 1` check.

5. Remove unnecessary `else` statement: In the inner loop, when `a[i]` is odd, we decrement `a[i+1]`. Since we are breaking the loop when `a[i+1]` becomes 0, there is no need for an `else` statement. We can directly decrement `a[i+1]` without the `else` statement.

6. Remove unnecessary `using namespace std;`: It is generally considered bad practice to use `using namespace std;` in global scope. We can remove it and use the `std::` prefix for standard library functions and types.

Optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  int n;
  std::cin >> n;
  int* a = new int[n];
  int flag = 1;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    std::cin >> a[i];
  for (int i = 0; i < n-1; i++) {
    if (a[i] & 1) {
      if (a[i + 1] == 0) {
        flag = 0;
        break;
      }
      a[i + 1]--;
    }
  }
  std::cout << (flag ? "YES" : "NO") << "\n";
  delete[] a;
}
```
