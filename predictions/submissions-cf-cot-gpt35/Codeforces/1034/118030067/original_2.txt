The given program has a few areas that can be optimized:

1. Remove unnecessary header files: The program includes `<bits/stdc++.h>` which includes all the standard library headers. This can slow down the compilation process and increase memory usage. Instead, we can include only the necessary headers.

2. Remove unnecessary macros: The program defines several macros that are not used in the code. These macros can be removed to simplify the code.

3. Avoid using `unordered_map` for counting factors: The program uses an `unordered_map` to count the factors of each number. However, since the prime factors are already stored in a set, we can directly count the occurrence of each factor using an array.

4. Avoid using `set` for prime factors: The program uses a `set` to store the prime factors of each number. However, the order of the prime factors does not matter in this case. We can simply use a `vector` to store the prime factors and avoid the overhead of maintaining a set.

5. Avoid unnecessary division: The program divides each element of the array by the GCD. However, since we are only interested in the prime factors of each number, we can skip this division step and directly factorize the numbers.

6. Avoid unnecessary iteration: The program iterates over the input array twice - once to calculate the GCD and once to factorize the numbers. We can combine these two steps into a single iteration to improve efficiency.

7. Avoid unnecessary memory allocation: The program uses a `vector` to store the input array and a `map` to store the count of factors. We can optimize memory usage by using a simple array to store the input array and an array to store the count of factors.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <bitset>
#include <map>
using namespace std;

const int maxN = 15000007;
bitset<maxN> primes;
int spf[maxN];
int countOfFactors[maxN];

int gcd(int x, int y) {
  return y ? gcd(y, x % y) : x;
}

void sieve() {
  primes.set();
  primes[0] = primes[1] = 0;
  for (int i = 2; i < maxN; i++)
    spf[i] = i;
  for (int i = 4; i < maxN; i += 2) {
    if (i != 2)
      primes[i] = 0;
    spf[i] = 2;
  }
  for (int i = 3; i < maxN; i++) {
    if (primes[i]) {
      for (int j = i * i; j < maxN; j += i) {
        primes[j] = 0;
        spf[j] = i;
      }
    }
  }
}

void factorize(int n) {
  while (n != 1) {
    countOfFactors[spf[n]]++;
    n /= spf[n];
  }
}

void solve() {
  sieve();
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  int v[n];
  int gcdIs = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> v[i];
    gcdIs = gcd(gcdIs, v[i]);
    factorize(v[i]);
  }
  int keep = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < maxN; i++) {
    keep = max(keep, countOfFactors[i]);
  }
  keep ? (cout << n - keep) : (cout << "-1");
}

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  solve();
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized version of the program removes unnecessary macros, avoids unnecessary data structures, combines the GCD calculation and factorization into a single iteration, and optimizes memory usage.
