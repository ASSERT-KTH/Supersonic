The given program has several areas that can be optimized:

1. Remove unnecessary header files: The program includes "bits/stdc++.h" which includes all the standard C++ header files. However, this can increase compilation time and memory usage. We can remove this and include only the necessary standard header files.

2. Remove unnecessary macros: The program defines several macros, such as `cont`, `ff`, `ss`, `pb`, `ins`, `mp`, `EPS`, `INF`, etc. These macros are not used in the code and can be removed.

3. Remove unnecessary typedefs: The program defines several typedefs, such as `vi`, `si`, `pi`, `vpi`, `mi`. These typedefs are not used in the code and can be removed.

4. Remove unused functions: The program defines several functions, such as `isPowOfTwo`, `ip_arr`, `op_arr`, `fill_arr`, `fill_vec`, `sortv`. These functions are not used in the code and can be removed.

5. Optimize the sieve algorithm: The sieve function `sieve()` can be optimized by only iterating up to the square root of `maxN`. This will reduce the number of iterations and improve the running time.

6. Optimize the factorization function: The factorization function `factorize()` can be optimized by using a more efficient algorithm. Instead of using a set to store prime factors, we can directly count the prime factors using a loop.

7. Avoid unnecessary division: The program divides each element of the array `v` by `gcdIs`, but this is not necessary. Instead, we can divide `gcdIs` by the greatest common divisor of all elements in `v` to simplify the calculations.

8. Avoid unnecessary unordered_map: The program uses an unordered_map `countOfFactors` to count the number of factors. However, this can be simplified by using a variable `keep` to keep track of the maximum count.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <cmath>
#include <algorithm>
#include <map>
using namespace std;

int gcd(int x, int y) {
    return y ? gcd(y, x % y) : x;
}

const int maxN = 15000007;
bitset<maxN> primes;
int spf[maxN];

void sieve() {
    primes.set();
    primes[0] = primes[1] = 0;
    for (int i = 2; i * i < maxN; i++) {
        if (primes[i]) {
            for (int j = i * i; j < maxN; j += i) {
                primes[j] = 0;
            }
        }
    }
}

void factorize(int n, map<int, int>& countOfFactors) {
    int count = 0;
    while (n % 2 == 0) {
        n /= 2;
        count++;
    }
    if (count > 0) {
        countOfFactors[2] = max(countOfFactors[2], count);
    }
    for (int i = 3; i * i <= n; i += 2) {
        count = 0;
        while (n % i == 0) {
            n /= i;
            count++;
        }
        if (count > 0) {
            countOfFactors[i] = max(countOfFactors[i], count);
        }
    }
    if (n > 1) {
        countOfFactors[n] = max(countOfFactors[n], 1);
    }
}

void solve() {
    sieve();
    int n;
    cin >> n;
    vector<int> v(n);
    int gcdIs = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        cin >> v[i];
        gcdIs = gcd(gcdIs, v[i]);
    }
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        v[i] /= gcdIs;
    }
    map<int, int> countOfFactors;
    for (int eleInArray : v) {
        factorize(eleInArray, countOfFactors);
    }
    int keep = 0;
    for (auto i : countOfFactors) {
        keep = max(keep, i.second);
    }
    keep ? (cout << n - keep) : (cout << "-1");
}

int main() {
    solve();
    return 0;
}
```
