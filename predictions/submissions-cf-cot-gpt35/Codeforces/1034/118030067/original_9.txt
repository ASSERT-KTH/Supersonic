The given code is a program that finds the maximum number of elements that can be removed from an array such that the GCD of the remaining elements is 1.

To optimize this code, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary header files: The code includes the entire `bits/stdc++.h` header file, which is not recommended. We can remove this line and include only the necessary header files.

2. Remove unnecessary macros: The code defines several macros that are not used in the program. We can remove these macros to simplify the code.

3. Remove unnecessary typedefs: The code defines several typedefs that are not used in the program. We can remove these typedefs to simplify the code.

4. Remove unnecessary function: The code defines a function `setUpLocal()` that is not used in the program. We can remove this function to simplify the code.

5. Use a more efficient algorithm for finding the GCD: The code uses the recursive Euclidean algorithm for finding the GCD of the elements in the array. We can replace this with the built-in `__gcd()` function from the `<algorithm>` header, which is more efficient.

6. Use a more efficient algorithm for prime factorization: The code uses a sieve algorithm to find all prime numbers up to a given limit. We can replace this with a more efficient algorithm such as the Pollard's rho algorithm or the trial division algorithm.

7. Remove unnecessary data structures: The code uses an unordered map to store the count of prime factors. We can replace this with a simple integer variable to store the maximum count.

8. Simplify the output code: The code uses a ternary operator to print the result. We can simplify this by using an if-else statement.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

int gcd(int x, int y) {
    return __gcd(x, y);
}

int main() {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(NULL);

    int n;
    cin >> n;
    vector<int> v(n);
    int gcdIs = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        cin >> v[i];
        gcdIs = gcd(gcdIs, v[i]);
    }
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        v[i] /= gcdIs;
    }
    int keep = 0;
    int countOfFactors = 0;
    for (int eleInArray : v) {
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = 2; i * i <= eleInArray; i++) {
            while (eleInArray % i == 0) {
                eleInArray /= i;
                count++;
            }
        }
        if (eleInArray > 1) {
            count++;
        }
        countOfFactors = max(countOfFactors, count);
    }
    if (countOfFactors > 0) {
        cout << n - countOfFactors;
    } else {
        cout << "-1";
    }

    return 0;
}
```

Explanation of the optimization steps:

1. We removed the unnecessary header files and included only the necessary ones.

2. We removed the unnecessary macros to simplify the code.

3. We removed the unnecessary typedefs to simplify the code.

4. We removed the unused `setUpLocal()` function to simplify the code.

5. We replaced the recursive Euclidean algorithm with the built-in `__gcd()` function for finding the GCD, which is more efficient.

6. We replaced the sieve algorithm with a simpler algorithm for prime factorization using a loop and trial division.

7. We replaced the unordered map with a simple integer variable to store the maximum count of prime factors.

8. We simplified the output code by using an if-else statement instead of the ternary operator.
