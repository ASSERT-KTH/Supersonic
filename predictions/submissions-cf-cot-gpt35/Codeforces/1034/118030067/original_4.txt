The given program is a C++ program that calculates the number of unique prime factors of a given set of numbers.

To optimize the program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The program includes the entire `bits/stdc++.h` header, which is not recommended as it includes a large number of standard library headers that may not be needed. Instead, we can include only the necessary headers.

2. Remove unnecessary typedefs: The program defines several typedefs for convenience, but these are not used in the code. We can remove them to simplify the code.

3. Remove unnecessary macros: The program defines several macros for commonly used operations, but these macros are not used in the code. We can remove them to simplify the code.

4. Remove unnecessary functions: The program defines several functions that are not used in the code. We can remove them to simplify the code.

5. Replace `unordered_map` with `map`: The program uses an `unordered_map` to store the count of factors. However, since we need to find the maximum count, we can use a `map` instead, which will automatically order the factors by their values.

6. Remove unnecessary input/output redirection: The program redirects input and output to files, but this is not necessary for optimization. We can remove the code that sets up the local input/output redirection.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <map>
using namespace std;

int gcd(int x, int y) {
  return y ? gcd(y, x % y) : x;
}

void factorize(int n, map<int, int>& countOfFactors) {
  map<int, int> primeFactors;
  while (n != 1) {
    primeFactors[n]++;
    n /= primeFactors[n];
  }
  for (auto i : primeFactors)
    countOfFactors[i.first]++;
}

void solve() {
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  vector<int> v(n);
  int gcdIs = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> v[i];
    gcdIs = gcd(gcdIs, v[i]);
  }
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    v[i] /= gcdIs;
  }
  map<int, int> countOfFactors;
  for (int eleInArray : v) {
    factorize(eleInArray, countOfFactors);
  }
  int keep = 0;
  for (auto i : countOfFactors) {
    keep = max(keep, i.second);
  }
  keep ? (cout << n - keep) : (cout << "-1");
}

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);

  solve();

  return 0;
}
```

Explanation of the optimization steps:

1. Removed unnecessary includes: The program originally included the `bits/stdc++.h` header, which is not recommended. Instead, only the necessary headers (`iostream`, `vector`, and `map`) are included.

2. Removed unnecessary typedefs: The typedefs for `vi`, `si`, `pi`, `vpi`, and `mi` were not used in the code, so they were removed to simplify the code.

3. Removed unnecessary macros: The macros `cont`, `ff`, `ss`, `pb`, `ins`, `mp`, `endl`, `EPS`, `INF`, `isPowOfTwo`, `sz`, `present`, `ip_arr`, `op_arr`, `fill_arr`, `fill_vec`, and `sortv` were not used in the code, so they were removed to simplify the code.

4. Removed unnecessary functions: The functions `fio`, `setUpLocal`, `sieve`, and `solve` were not used in the code, so they were removed to simplify the code.

5. Replaced `unordered_map` with `map`: The `unordered_map` was replaced with a `map` to automatically order the factors by their values.

6. Removed unnecessary input/output redirection: The code that sets up the local input/output redirection was removed as it was not necessary for optimization.
