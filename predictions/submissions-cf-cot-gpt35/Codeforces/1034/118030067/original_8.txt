The given program can be optimized in the following steps:

1. Remove unnecessary header files: The program includes "bits/stdc++.h" which includes a large number of header files. Instead of including all the header files, we can include only the necessary ones. In this case, we only need the following header files:
   ```cpp
   #include <iostream>
   #include <vector>
   #include <set>
   #include <map>
   #include <unordered_map>
   #include <bitset>
   ```
   
2. Remove unnecessary typedefs and macros: The program includes several typedefs and macros that are not used. We can remove them to simplify the code.

3. Remove unnecessary function declarations: The program declares the functions `fio()`, `setUpLocal()`, `sieve()`, `factorize()`, and `gcd()`, but these functions are not used. We can safely remove them.

4. Remove unnecessary code: The program defines a number of macros and constants that are not used. We can remove them to simplify the code.

5. Remove unused variables: The program declares the variables `pi`, `vpi`, `mi`, and `steps`, but they are not used. We can remove these declarations.

6. Optimize the loop: The loop where the prime factors are calculated can be optimized. Currently, it iterates over all the numbers up to `maxN` and checks if each number is prime. However, we can optimize this loop by only checking numbers up to the square root of `maxN` and skipping even numbers (except 2) to reduce the number of iterations.

7. Optimize memory usage: The program uses an `unordered_map` to store the count of factors. However, we can optimize the memory usage by using a `vector` instead of a map. Since the maximum number of factors is known (15000007), we can create a vector of size `maxN` and update the count directly at the index corresponding to the factor.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <set>
#include <map>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <bitset>
using namespace std;

const int maxN = 15000007;
bitset<maxN> primes;
int spf[maxN];
vector<int> countOfFactors(maxN);

void sieve() {
  primes.set();
  primes[0] = primes[1] = 0;
  spf[2] = 2;
  for (int i = 4; i < maxN; i += 2) {
    primes[i] = 0;
    spf[i] = 2;
  }
  for (int i = 3; i * i < maxN; i += 2) {
    if (primes[i]) {
      for (int j = i * i; j < maxN; j += i * 2) {
        primes[j] = 0;
        spf[j] = i;
      }
    }
  }
}

void factorize(int n) {
  set<int> primeFactors;
  while (n != 1) {
    primeFactors.insert(spf[n]);
    n /= spf[n];
  }
  for (int i : primeFactors)
    countOfFactors[i]++;
}

void solve() {
  sieve();
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  vector<int> v(n);
  int gcdIs = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> v[i];
    gcdIs = __gcd(gcdIs, v[i]);
  }
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    v[i] /= gcdIs;
  }
  for (int eleInArray : v) {
    factorize(eleInArray);
  }
  int keep = 0;
  for (int i : countOfFactors) {
    keep = max(keep, i);
  }
  keep ? (cout << n - keep) : (cout << "-1");
}

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  
  solve();
  
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized code simplifies the program, removes unnecessary parts, optimizes the prime factorization loop, and optimizes memory usage.
