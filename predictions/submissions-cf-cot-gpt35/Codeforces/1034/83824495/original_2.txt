To optimize the given program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Use a more efficient algorithm to calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the array elements. Instead of using the `__gcd` function from the `<bits/stdc++.h>` library, we can implement the GCD calculation using the Euclidean algorithm.

2. Reduce the size of the `cont` array. The current size is `N`, which is unnecessarily large. We can reduce the size to the maximum possible value of `arr[i]` in the input array.

3. Modify the last loop to only iterate up to the maximum possible value of `arr[i]` in the input array. This will eliminate unnecessary iterations and improve runtime.

Here is the optimized program with the above modifications:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int gcd(int a, int b) {
  while (b != 0) {
    int temp = b;
    b = a % b;
    a = temp;
  }
  return a;
}

int main() {
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  vector<int> arr(n);
  int mcd = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> arr[i];
    mcd = gcd(mcd, arr[i]);
  }
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    arr[i] /= mcd;
  
  int maxVal = *max_element(arr.begin(), arr.end());
  vector<int> cont(maxVal + 1, 0);
  
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    while (arr[i] > 1) {
      int f = arr[i];
      cont[f]++;
      while (arr[i] % f == 0)
        arr[i] /= f;
    }
  }
  
  int maxi = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i <= maxVal; i++)
    maxi = max(maxi, cont[i]);
  
  if (maxi == 0)
    cout << -1 << '\n';
  else
    cout << n - maxi << '\n';
  
  return 0;
}
```

Explanation of optimizations:

1. Replaced the `__gcd` function with a custom implementation using the Euclidean algorithm. This algorithm has a time complexity of O(log(min(a, b))), compared to the `__gcd` function which has a time complexity of O(log(a + b)).

2. Changed the `cont` array from a fixed size array of size `N` to a dynamically sized vector with a size of `maxVal + 1`. This reduces memory usage by only allocating the necessary space for storing the counts of each factor.

3. Modified the loop to iterate up to `maxVal` instead of `N` in the last loop. This eliminates unnecessary iterations and improves runtime.
