The given program calculates the maximum number of distinct prime factors among the elements of an array. It first uses a sieve algorithm to calculate the least prime factor (lpf) for each number up to a certain limit N. Then, it reads an array of integers and calculates the greatest common divisor (gcd) of all the elements. After that, it divides each element of the array by the gcd and counts the number of distinct prime factors for each element using the lpf array. Finally, it finds the maximum count of distinct prime factors and prints the difference between the size of the array and the maximum count.

To optimize the program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove the unnecessary inclusion of the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header. It is not a standard C++ header and includes a large number of unnecessary headers.

2. Change the size of the lpf and cont arrays from `N` to `n` since these arrays only need to store information for the elements in the input array.

3. Remove the sieve algorithm and use the gcd function to calculate the least prime factor for each number. This eliminates the need for the lpf array.

4. Instead of dividing each element of the array by the gcd, we can calculate the gcd and count the distinct prime factors in a single loop.

5. Remove the unnecessary loop to find the maximum count of distinct prime factors. We can calculate this count while counting the distinct prime factors in the previous loop.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    int n;
    cin >> n;
    int arr[n];
    int cont[n] = {0};
    int maxi = 0;
    int mcd = 0;
    
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        cin >> arr[i];
        mcd = __gcd(mcd, arr[i]);
    }
    
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        arr[i] /= mcd;
        int temp = arr[i];
        
        while (temp > 1) {
            int f = __gcd(temp, arr[i]);
            cont[f]++;
            maxi = max(maxi, cont[f]);
            
            while (temp % f == 0)
                temp /= f;
        }
    }
    
    if (maxi == 0)
        cout << -1 << '\n';
    else
        cout << n - maxi << '\n';
    
    return 0;
}
```

This optimized program reduces the memory usage by using smaller arrays and improves the running time by eliminating the sieve algorithm and unnecessary loops.
