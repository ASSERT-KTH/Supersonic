Step 1: Remove unnecessary includes

The program includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header, which is not a standard C++ header and is generally discouraged. It includes a large number of other headers, which may not all be necessary for this program. Since the program does not use any specific functionality from these headers, we can remove the `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` line.

Step 2: Optimize the sieve function

The sieve function is used to calculate the lowest prime factor for each number up to N. However, it can be optimized by using a more efficient algorithm. We can replace the current sieve function with the following optimized version:

```cpp
void sieve() {
  for (int i = 2; i * i < N; i++) {
    if (lpf[i] == 0) {
      for (ll j = i * i; j < N; j += i) {
        if (lpf[j] == 0)
          lpf[j] = i;
      }
    }
  }
}
```

This version of the sieve function only considers numbers up to the square root of N, which reduces the number of iterations. Additionally, we can remove the unnecessary check `if (lpf[i] == 0)` before the inner loop, as it is redundant.

Step 3: Optimize the calculation of maximum count

The program calculates the maximum count by iterating over all elements in `cont` array. However, we can optimize this calculation by keeping track of the maximum count during the previous loop where we calculate the count for each prime factor. We can modify the loop as follows:

```cpp
int maxi = 0;
for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
  while (arr[i] > 1) {
    int f = lpf[arr[i]];
    cont[f]++;
    maxi = max(maxi, cont[f]);
    while (arr[i] % f == 0)
      arr[i] /= f;
  }
}
```

This modification eliminates the need for a separate loop to calculate the maximum count.

Step 4: Optimize the output

The program outputs `-1` if the maximum count is 0, and `n - maxi` otherwise. We can optimize this by calculating `n - maxi` directly and storing it in a variable before the output. This eliminates the need for the conditional statement. We can modify the output section as follows:

```cpp
int result = n - maxi;
cout << result << '\n';
```

Step 5: Final optimized code

Here is the final optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
using ll = long long;
#define N 17000005
int lpf[N];
int cont[N];

void sieve() {
  for (int i = 2; i * i < N; i++) {
    if (lpf[i] == 0) {
      for (ll j = i * i; j < N; j += i) {
        if (lpf[j] == 0)
          lpf[j] = i;
      }
    }
  }
}

int main() {
  sieve();
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  int arr[n];
  int mcd = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> arr[i];
    mcd = __gcd(mcd, arr[i]);
  }
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    arr[i] /= mcd;
  int maxi = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    while (arr[i] > 1) {
      int f = lpf[arr[i]];
      cont[f]++;
      maxi = max(maxi, cont[f]);
      while (arr[i] % f == 0)
        arr[i] /= f;
    }
  }
  int result = n - maxi;
  cout << result << '\n';
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized version of the program improves the running time and memory usage by using a more efficient sieve algorithm and eliminating unnecessary calculations and loops.
