To optimize the given program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The header `<bits/stdc++.h>` includes a lot of other headers, which may not be required in this program. We can remove this line and only include the necessary headers.

2. Remove unused macros: The macros `L(x)` and `R(x)` are defined but not used in the program. We can remove these macros.

3. Avoid using `vector` for storing indices: In the original program, we use two separate vectors `one` and `two` to store the indices of elements with values 1 and 2, respectively. Instead, we can directly process the elements while reading them and avoid the need for these vectors.

4. Use a simpler data structure for priority queue: In the original program, we use a `priority_queue` to keep track of the elements in `two` vector with their counts. However, we only need to find the element with the maximum count. We can use a simple variable to store the maximum count and update it accordingly.

5. Avoid unnecessary operations: In the original program, we perform multiple operations on the `two` vector, such as adding and removing elements. Instead, we can keep track of the indices directly and perform the necessary operations on the `t` array.

6. Remove unnecessary checks: In the original program, we check if `t[x]` is 0 before adding an element to the answer. However, this check is redundant because we already know that the count of `x` is greater than 0 (otherwise it would not be in the priority queue).

Here is the optimized C++ program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(0);
  cin.tie(0);
  
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  
  int t[n];
  int sum = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> t[i];
    sum += t[i];
  }
  
  if (sum > 2 * n * (n - 1) || sum < 2 * n - 2) {
    cout << "NO";
    return 0;
  }
  
  vector<pair<int, int>> ans;
  int maxCount = 0;
  int maxIndex = -1;
  
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    if (t[i] == 1) {
      if (maxCount > 0) {
        ans.push_back({i, maxIndex});
        t[maxIndex]--;
        maxCount--;
      } else {
        ans.push_back({i, 0});
        t[0]--;
      }
    } else {
      if (maxCount > 0) {
        ans.push_back({i, maxIndex});
        t[maxIndex]--;
        maxCount--;
      } else {
        maxIndex = i;
        maxCount = t[i];
      }
    }
  }
  
  cout << "YES" << " " << maxIndex + 1 << endl;
  cout << ans.size() << endl;
  for (auto x : ans)
    cout << x.first + 1 << " " << x.second + 1 << " " << endl;
}
```

Explanation of the optimizations:

1. Removed unnecessary includes: The original program included `<bits/stdc++.h>`, which includes a lot of other headers. However, in this program, we only need `iostream`, `vector`, and `queue`, so we include only those headers.

2. Removed unused macros: The macros `L(x)` and `R(x)` were defined but not used in the program, so they were removed.

3. Avoided using `vector` for storing indices: Instead of storing the indices in separate vectors `one` and `two`, we directly process the elements while reading them. If the element is 1, we add it to the answer with the maximum count element from `two`. If the element is 2, we update the maximum count element.

4. Used a simpler data structure for priority queue: Instead of using a `priority_queue` to keep track of the elements in `two` vector with their counts, we only need to find the element with the maximum count. We use a simple variable `maxCount` to store the maximum count and update it accordingly.

5. Avoided unnecessary operations: Instead of performing multiple operations on the `two` vector, such as adding and removing elements, we keep track of the maximum count element directly using the `maxCount` variable. This simplifies the code and improves performance.

6. Removed unnecessary checks: Instead of checking if `t[x]` is 0 before adding an element to the answer, we can directly add the element because we already know that the count of `x` is greater than 0 (otherwise it would not be the maximum count element). This removes the redundant check and improves performance.
