The given program is a solution to a problem. To optimize it, we need to analyze the code and identify any unnecessary operations or redundant calculations.

1. Unnecessary includes: The program includes the header file `bits/stdc++.h`, which is not a standard C++ header file and can be slow to compile. We can replace it with the specific header files that are actually required by the program.

2. Unused variables and functions: The program defines several variables and functions that are not used in the code. We can remove these unused variables and functions to improve readability and reduce memory usage.

3. Redundant calculations: The program calculates the prime factors and generates a sieve, but these calculations are not used in the `test()` function. We can remove these calculations to improve running time and reduce memory usage.

Based on these optimizations, the optimized program is as follows:

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <utility>
using namespace std;

void test() {
  int n, m;
  cin >> n >> m;
  if (n == 2) {
    cout << 2 << " " << 2 << endl;
    cout << 1 << " " << 2 << " " << 2 << endl;
    return;
  }
  int total_sum = n;
  cout << 2 << " " << total_sum << endl;
  vector<pair<pair<int, int>, int>> edges;
  int sum = 0;
  edges.push_back(make_pair(make_pair(1, n), 2));
  sum = 2;
  for (int i = 2; i < n - 1; i++) {
    edges.push_back(make_pair(make_pair(1, i), 1));
    sum++;
  }
  if (n - 1 != 1)
    edges.push_back(make_pair(make_pair(1, n - 1), total_sum - sum));
  m -= edges.size();
  for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
    if (m == 0)
      break;
    for (int j = i + 1; j <= n; j++) {
      if (m == 0)
        break;
      edges.push_back(make_pair(make_pair(i, j), max(total_sum - sum, 2ll) + 1));
      m--;
    }
  }
  for (int i = 0; i < edges.size(); i++) {
    cout << edges[i].first.first << " " << edges[i].first.second << " " << edges[i].second << "\n";
  }
}

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(0);
  int t = 1;
  while (t--)
    test();
  return 0;
}
```

In this optimized program, we removed the unnecessary includes, unused variables and functions, and redundant calculations. The program should now have improved running time and reduced memory usage.
