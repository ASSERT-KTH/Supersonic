The original program reads a number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads a number `n` followed by `n` integers. It then inserts these integers into a set to eliminate duplicates, and finally prints the size of the set.

To optimize the program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove the unnecessary include statement `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`. This statement includes a large number of header files, which can slow down the compilation process.

2. Instead of using a `set` to eliminate duplicates, we can use an `unordered_set`, which has a faster average insertion time and lookup time.

3. We can avoid using the `ll` type for the loop variables `t` and `n`, and instead use `int` since the problem statement does not mention any constraints on these variables.

Based on these optimizations, here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_set>

int main() {
  int t;
  std::cin >> t;

  while (t--) {
    int n;
    std::cin >> n;

    std::unordered_set<int> a;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      int x;
      std::cin >> x;
      a.insert(x);
    }

    std::cout << a.size() << std::endl;
  }

  return 0;
}
```
