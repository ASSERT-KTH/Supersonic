Step 1: Remove unnecessary includes

The program includes the entire `<bits/stdc++.h>` header, which is not necessary. We can remove it and include only the required headers.

Step 2: Optimize I/O operations

The program currently uses `cin` and `cout` for input and output operations. These operations are slower compared to using `scanf` and `printf` in C or `scanf` and `printf` with `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); cin.tie(NULL);` in C++. We can replace `cin` and `cout` with `scanf` and `printf` for faster I/O.

Step 3: Optimize the data structure

The program currently uses a `set` to store the input numbers and count the unique elements. However, using a `set` has a higher memory overhead compared to using a `unordered_set` or a simple array. We can replace the `set` with an `unordered_set` to reduce memory usage.

Step 4: Optimize the loop

The program uses a `while` loop to iterate over the input numbers. We can replace it with a `for` loop, which is generally faster and more readable.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_set>
#define ll long long
using namespace std;

int main() {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(NULL);

    ll t;
    scanf("%lld", &t);
    while (t--) {
        ll n, x;
        scanf("%lld", &n);
        unordered_set<ll> a;
        for (ll i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            scanf("%lld", &x);
            a.insert(x);
        }
        printf("%lld\n", (ll)a.size());
    }

    return 0;
}
```
