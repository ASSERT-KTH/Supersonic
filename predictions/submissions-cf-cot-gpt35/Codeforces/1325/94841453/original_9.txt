This program reads a number `t` as input to determine how many test cases will be performed. For each test case, it reads a number `n`, followed by `n` numbers. It inserts these numbers into a set `a` and prints the size of the set.

To optimize this program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove the unnecessary inclusion of the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header. This header includes all standard library headers, which can slow down the compilation process.

2. Change the type of `n` and `x` from `ll` to `int`. Since `n` and `x` represent the number of elements in the set and the elements themselves, respectively, it is unlikely that they will exceed the maximum value representable by an `int`.

3. Replace the `set` container with an `unordered_set`. The `unordered_set` provides constant-time average complexity for insertion and retrieval operations, while the `set` container provides logarithmic complexity.

4. Remove the `using namespace std;` statement. It is generally considered good practice to avoid namespace pollution by explicitly using the `std::` prefix for standard library entities.

5. Use a more efficient method to read the input. Instead of using `cin` to read each number individually, we can use `istream_iterator` and `copy` to read the entire sequence of numbers into the `unordered_set` at once.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_set>

int main() {
  int t;
  std::cin >> t;
  
  while (t--) {
    int n;
    std::cin >> n;
    
    std::unordered_set<int> a;
    std::copy_n(std::istream_iterator<int>(std::cin), n, std::inserter(a, a.end()));
    
    std::cout << a.size() << std::endl;
  }
}
```
