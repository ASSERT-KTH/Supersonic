Explanation of the optimization steps:

1. Remove unnecessary header inclusion: The current program includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header, which is not necessary and can increase the compilation time and memory usage. We can remove it and include only the necessary headers.

2. Avoid using `using namespace std;`: The current program uses the `using namespace std;` statement, which can lead to namespace conflicts and make the code harder to maintain. We can avoid it and use the `std::` prefix for standard library types and functions.

3. Use `std::unordered_set` instead of `std::set`: The current program uses a `std::set` to store the unique elements, which has an average insertion time complexity of O(log n). We can use a `std::unordered_set` instead, which has an average insertion time complexity of O(1) and can improve the overall runtime.

4. Use `reserve` function to preallocate memory for `std::unordered_set`: The current program inserts elements into the `std::unordered_set` one by one, which can lead to frequent memory reallocations and impact performance. We can use the `reserve` function to preallocate memory for the set based on the expected number of elements, reducing the number of reallocations.

5. Use `std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false)` and `std::cin.tie(nullptr)`: The current program uses the `cin` and `cout` streams, which are synchronized with the standard C streams (`stdin` and `stdout`). This synchronization can add overhead to the I/O operations. We can disable this synchronization using the `std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false)` function and improve the I/O performance. Additionally, we can use the `std::cin.tie(nullptr)` function to untie `cin` from `cout`, further improving the I/O performance.

Optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_set>

int main() {
  std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  std::cin.tie(nullptr);

  int t;
  std::cin >> t;

  while (t--) {
    int n;
    std::cin >> n;

    std::unordered_set<int> a;
    a.reserve(n);

    while (n--) {
      int x;
      std::cin >> x;
      a.insert(x);
    }

    std::cout << a.size() << '\n';
  }

  return 0;
}
```
