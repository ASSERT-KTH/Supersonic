The given program reads a number of test cases and for each test case, it reads a number `n` followed by `n` integers. It then inserts these integers into a set and prints the size of the set.

To optimize the program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove the unnecessary inclusion of the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header. This header includes many other headers and may increase the compilation time and memory usage. Instead, include only the necessary headers, such as `<iostream>` and `<set>`.

2. Replace the `while (n--)` loop with a `for` loop that counts from 0 to `n-1`. This eliminates the need to decrement `n` in each iteration.

3. Use `reserve` function of the `std::set` to reserve memory for `n` elements. This can improve memory allocation efficiency.

4. Use a more efficient way to read integers. Instead of using `cin` for each integer, we can use `std::istream_iterator` and `std::copy` to read all the integers at once and insert them into the set. This can potentially improve the input processing time.

5. Remove the unnecessary usage of `std::endl` and replace it with `'\n'`. `std::endl` flushes the output buffer, which can be an expensive operation. Using `'\n'` instead only adds a newline character without flushing the buffer.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <set>
#include <iterator>

int main() {
  int t;
  std::cin >> t;
  
  while (t--) {
    int n;
    std::cin >> n;
    
    std::set<int> a;
    a.reserve(n); // Reserve memory for n elements
    
    std::copy_n(std::istream_iterator<int>(std::cin), n, std::inserter(a, a.end())); // Read n integers and insert them into the set
    
    std::cout << a.size() << '\n';
  }
}
```
