The given C++ program reads an integer `t` as the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` followed by `n` integers. It inserts these `n` integers into a set `a`. Finally, it prints the size of the set `a`.

To optimize this program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Instead of using the `bits/stdc++.h` header, we can include only the necessary headers. In this case, we need `<iostream>` and `<set>`.
2. Instead of using `cin` and `cout` for input/output, we can use `scanf` and `printf`. This is because `scanf` and `printf` are generally faster than `cin` and `cout`.
3. We can avoid using the `set` to store the elements and calculate its size. Instead, we can use a `unordered_set` (hash set) to store the elements. The `unordered_set` does not maintain the order of the elements, but it has a faster average insertion time and lookup time compared to `set`. We can use the `size` function of the `unordered_set` to get the number of distinct elements.

Here is the optimized C++ program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_set>
#define ll long long
using namespace std;

int main() {
  ll t;
  scanf("%lld", &t);
  while (t--) {
    ll n, x;
    scanf("%lld", &n);
    unordered_set<ll> a;
    for (ll i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      scanf("%lld", &x);
      a.insert(x);
    }
    printf("%lu\n", a.size());
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Explanation of optimizations:
1. We include only the necessary headers `<iostream>` and `<unordered_set>`.
2. We use `scanf` and `printf` for input/output instead of `cin` and `cout`.
3. We replace `set<ll>` with `unordered_set<ll>`.
4. We use a `for` loop instead of a `while` loop with `n--` condition to iterate `n` times.
5. We use `%lu` format specifier in `printf` to print the size of the `unordered_set`.

These optimizations should improve the running time and memory usage of the program.
