Step 1: Remove unnecessary header files
The program includes the header file `<bits/stdc++.h>`, which includes a large number of other header files. This can slow down the compilation process and increase memory usage. Since the program does not actually use any of the included headers, we can remove this line.

Step 2: Replace `vector<int>` with a fixed-size array
The program uses a `vector<int>` to store even numbers. However, the maximum size of this vector is known in advance (it is equal to the input size `n`). Therefore, we can replace the vector with a fixed-size array to save memory.

Step 3: Use a boolean array instead of a map to track used numbers
The program uses a `map<int, bool>` to track whether a number has been used or not. However, the keys of this map are limited to even numbers, and the maximum possible value of these numbers is not very large. Therefore, we can use a boolean array of fixed size instead of a map to save memory and improve performance.
