The given program is calculating the number of times each even number in the input can be divided by 2 until it becomes odd, and then summing up these counts.

Here are the steps to optimize the program:

Step 1: Remove unnecessary includes and macros.
- `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` includes a lot of unnecessary headers. We can replace it with the specific headers we need.
- The `pb` macro is not used in the program. We can remove it.

Step 2: Use `unordered_set` instead of `set`.
- The `set<int> st` is used to keep track of seen numbers. However, the order of elements in the set is not important in this program. We can use `unordered_set<int>` instead, which has better average case performance for insertions and searches.

Step 3: Use `unordered_map` instead of `map`.
- The `map<int, bool> used` is used to keep track of whether a number has been used or not. Again, the order of elements in the map is not important in this program. We can use `unordered_map<int, bool>` instead, which has better average case performance for insertions and searches.

Step 4: Use range-based for loop instead of indexing.
- Instead of using `for (int i = 0; i < even.size(); i++)` and indexing `even[i]`, we can use a range-based for loop to iterate over the elements directly.

Here is the optimized C++ program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_set>
#include <unordered_map>
using namespace std;

bool comp(int a, int b) { return a > b; }

int main() {
  int t;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    int n, res = 0;
    cin >> n;
    vector<int> even;
    unordered_set<int> st;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      int x;
      cin >> x;
      if (x % 2 == 0 && !st.count(x))
        even.push_back(x);
      st.insert(x);
    }
    sort(even.begin(), even.end(), comp);
    unordered_map<int, bool> used;
    for (int b : even) {
      if (!used[b]) {
        while (b % 2 == 0) {
          used[b] = true;
          b /= 2;
          ++res;
        }
      }
    }
    cout << res << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```
