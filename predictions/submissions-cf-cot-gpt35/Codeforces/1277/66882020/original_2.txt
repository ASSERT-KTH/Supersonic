Optimization Steps:
1. Remove unnecessary includes: The program includes `<bits/stdc++.h>`, which is not a standard header file and includes all the standard library header files. This can result in increased compilation time and unnecessary memory usage. We can remove this include and include only the necessary header files.
2. Avoid namespace std: The program is using the `using namespace std;` statement, which can lead to naming conflicts and make the code less readable. We can remove this statement and use the `std::` prefix for standard library functions and objects.
3. Use specific data types: The program uses `int` for loop variables and container sizes. It is recommended to use the appropriate data types (`size_t` for loop variables and `std::size_t` for container sizes) to avoid potential issues with negative values and to improve code readability.
4. Use reserve() for vector: Instead of dynamically resizing the `even` vector, we can use the `reserve()` function to allocate memory upfront to avoid unnecessary reallocations.
5. Use unordered_set instead of set: The program uses a set to store unique even numbers. However, since the order doesn't matter, we can use an unordered_set instead of a set to improve insertion and lookup performance.
6. Use range-based for loop: Instead of using an index-based for loop to iterate over the elements of the `even` vector, we can use a range-based for loop to improve code readability.
7. Use auto keyword: Instead of explicitly specifying the type of iterator and container in the range-based for loop, we can use the `auto` keyword to let the compiler deduce the types.
8. Use bitwise operations instead of division: Instead of using the division operator (`/`) to check if a number is divisible by 2, we can use bitwise AND operator (`&`) with 1 to check the least significant bit. This can be more efficient.
9. Use emplace() instead of insert() for unordered_set: Instead of using the `insert()` function to insert elements into the unordered_set, we can use the `emplace()` function to construct the element in-place, which can be more efficient.

Optimized Program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_set>
#include <map>

bool comp(int a, int b) {
  return a > b;
}

int main() {
  int t;
  std::cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    size_t n, res = 0;
    std::cin >> n;
    std::vector<int> even;
    std::unordered_set<int> st;
    even.reserve(n);
    for (size_t i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      int x;
      std::cin >> x;
      if ((x & 1) == 0 && st.find(x) == st.end()) {
        even.push_back(x);
      }
      st.emplace(x);
    }
    std::sort(even.begin(), even.end(), comp);
    std::map<int, bool> used;
    for (const auto& num : even) {
      if (!used[num]) {
        int b = num;
        while ((b & 1) == 0) {
          used[b] = true;
          b >>= 1;
          ++res;
        }
      }
    }
    std::cout << res << std::endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
