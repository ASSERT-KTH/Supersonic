Step 1: Remove unnecessary includes and macros
- The code includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header, which is not recommended as it includes a large number of unnecessary headers. We can include only the necessary headers instead.
- The macro `pb` is defined but not used in the code. We can remove it.

Step 2: Optimize the loop for finding even numbers
- The code uses a set `st` to keep track of unique numbers and a vector `even` to store even numbers. However, we can optimize this by using only a set to store unique even numbers. This avoids the need to check for the existence of an even number in both the vector and the set.
- Instead of using `st.count(x)` to check if an even number has already been added, we can directly use `st.insert(x)` to insert the number into the set. If the number already exists in the set, it will not be inserted.

Step 3: Optimize the loop for counting even powers of 2
- The code uses a map `used` to keep track of numbers that have been processed. However, we can optimize this by using a set `used` instead. The map is not necessary since we only need to check if a number has been used or not.
- Instead of using `used[even[i]]` to check if a number has been used, we can directly use `used.count(even[i])`. If the number exists in the set, it means it has already been used.

Step 4: Simplify the loop for counting even powers of 2
- The loop can be simplified by using a while loop instead of an if statement inside a while loop.
- Instead of dividing `b` by 2 in each iteration, we can use bit shifting (`b >>= 1`) which is faster.

Step 5: Optimize the input/output operations
- The code uses `cin` and `cout` for input/output operations, which are slower compared to `scanf` and `printf`. We can use `scanf` and `printf` instead to optimize the program.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <set>
#include <map>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int t;
  scanf("%d", &t);
  while (t--) {
    int n, res = 0;
    scanf("%d", &n);
    set<int> even;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      int x;
      scanf("%d", &x);
      if (x % 2 == 0)
        even.insert(x);
    }
    map<int, bool> used;
    for (int x : even) {
      if (!used.count(x)) {
        int b = x;
        while (b % 2 == 0) {
          used.insert(b);
          b >>= 1;
          ++res;
        }
      }
    }
    printf("%d\n", res);
  }
  return 0;
}
```
