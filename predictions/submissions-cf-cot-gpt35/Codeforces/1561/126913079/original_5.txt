The given program reads an integer T as the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer N followed by N pairs of integers. It calculates the start and end values for each pair of integers and stores them in a vector. Then it sorts the vector and calculates the final start value.

To optimize the program for running time and memory usage, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary header files: The program includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header file, which includes a large number of standard library headers. We can remove this line and include only the necessary header files.

2. Use `int` instead of `long long int` for variables: The program uses `long long int` for most of the variables, which may not be necessary for the given problem constraints. We can use `int` instead to save memory.

3. Use a single loop for calculating start and end values: Instead of calculating the start and end values separately for each pair of integers and storing them in a vector, we can calculate them directly inside a single loop. This will save memory by eliminating the need for the vector.

4. Calculate the start and end values while reading the input: Instead of storing the pairs of integers and calculating the start and end values later, we can calculate them while reading the input. This will save memory by eliminating the need for storing the pairs in a vector.

5. Use `int` instead of `long long int` for loop variables: The program uses `long long int` for loop variables, which may not be necessary for the given problem constraints. We can use `int` instead to save memory.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int T;
  cin >> T;
  while (T--) {
    int N;
    cin >> N;
    int start = 0;
    int end = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
      int M;
      cin >> M;
      for (int j = 0; j < M; j++) {
        int x;
        cin >> x;
        int diff = x - j + 1;
        if (diff > start) {
          start = diff;
          end = M + start;
        } else {
          end = M + start + (start - diff);
        }
      }
    }
    cout << start << "\n";
  }
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized program removes unnecessary header files, uses `int` instead of `long long int` for variables, calculates the start and end values while reading the input, and uses `int` instead of `long long int` for loop variables. These modifications improve the running time and memory usage of the program.
