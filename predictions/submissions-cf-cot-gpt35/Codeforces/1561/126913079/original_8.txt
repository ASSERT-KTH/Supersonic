The given C++ program reads an integer T representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer N representing the number of elements in a vector. Then, it reads N integers and performs some calculations to find the value of "start" variable. Finally, it prints the value of "start" for each test case.

To optimize the program, we can make the following changes:

1. Remove unnecessary header file: The program includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header file, which includes multiple standard library header files. This can increase the compilation time and memory usage. We can remove this line and include only the necessary header files.

2. Use `reserve()` function for vector: In the original program, the vector `v` is resized multiple times within the loop. Resizing a vector can be an expensive operation, especially when the vector grows in size. We can improve the performance by using the `reserve()` function to allocate memory for the vector before the loop.

3. Use `emplace_back()` instead of `push_back()`: In the original program, the vector `v` is populated using `push_back()` function. This can lead to unnecessary copy operations. We can use `emplace_back()` function to directly construct the elements in-place without any copies.

4. Avoid unnecessary sorting: In the original program, the vector `v` is sorted using the `sort()` function. However, the subsequent loop only checks the elements in the order they were inserted. Therefore, sorting the vector is unnecessary and can be removed.

5. Optimize the loop to calculate "start" and "end": In the original program, the loop that calculates the values of "start" and "end" can be simplified. Instead of using an if-else statement, we can directly calculate the differences and update the variables accordingly.

Here is the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

int main() {
  int T;
  std::cin >> T;
  
  while (T--) {
    int N;
    std::cin >> N;
    
    std::vector<std::pair<int, int>> v;
    v.reserve(N); // Allocate memory for N elements
    
    int start = 0;
    int end = 0;
    
    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
      int M;
      std::cin >> M;
      
      std::vector<int> mx;
      mx.reserve(M); // Allocate memory for M elements
      
      for (int j = 0; j < M; j++) {
        int x;
        std::cin >> x;
        mx.emplace_back(x - j + 1); // Construct elements in-place
      }
      
      int max_val = *std::max_element(mx.begin(), mx.end());
      int cur_start = max_val;
      int cur_end = M + max_val;
      
      if (cur_start >= end) {
        start += cur_start - end;
        end = cur_end;
      } else {
        end += cur_end - cur_start;
      }
    }
    
    std::cout << start << "\n";
  }
  
  return 0;
}
```

By making these optimizations, we have reduced unnecessary operations and improved the running time and memory usage of the program.
