Step 1: Remove unnecessary header file inclusion.

The `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` includes a large number of header files, which can slow down the compilation process. Since we only need the `iostream` and `vector` headers, we can replace the `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` with `#include <iostream>` and `#include <vector>`.

Step 2: Avoid unnecessary vector copying.

In the inner loop, the `mx` vector is created and filled with values. Then, the maximum value is calculated using `max_element` and stored in the `start` variable. Finally, the `start` and `end` values are pushed into the `v` vector. However, we can avoid creating the `mx` vector and directly calculate the maximum value in the loop itself. This will save memory and eliminate the need for the `mx` vector.

Step 3: Avoid unnecessary sorting.

After all the intervals are collected in the `v` vector, it is sorted using `sort`. However, sorting is not necessary for the given problem. We can optimize this step by removing the sorting operation.

Step 4: Optimize the calculation of start and end values.

In the final loop, the start and end values are calculated based on the intervals in the `v` vector. However, we can optimize this calculation by directly updating the start and end values in each iteration, without the need for the `diff` variable.

Step 5: Use `'\n'` instead of `"\n"`.

Using `'\n'` instead of `"\n"` for the newline character can improve performance slightly.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);

  long long int T;
  cin >> T;

  while (T--) {
    long long int N;
    cin >> N;

    long long int start = 0;
    long long int end = 0;

    for (long long int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
      long long int M;
      cin >> M;

      long long int max_val = 0;

      for (long long int j = 0; j < M; j++) {
        long long int x;
        cin >> x;
        max_val = max(max_val, x - j + 1);
      }

      if (max_val >= end) {
        start += max_val - end;
        end = max_val + M;
      } else {
        end += max_val - end + M;
      }
    }

    cout << start << '\n';
  }

  return 0;
}
```

Explanation of optimizations:
1. Removed unnecessary header file inclusion.
2. Avoided unnecessary vector copying.
3. Removed unnecessary sorting.
4. Optimized the calculation of start and end values.
5. Used `'\n'` instead of `"\n"` for the newline character.
