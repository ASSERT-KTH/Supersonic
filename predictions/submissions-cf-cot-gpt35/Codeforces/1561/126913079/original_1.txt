The given program reads an integer T as the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer N as the number of elements, followed by N integers. It then performs some calculations and prints the result.

To optimize the program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Avoid including the entire `<bits/stdc++.h>` header. This header includes a lot of unnecessary libraries, which can slow down the compilation process.
2. Instead of using `cin` and `cout` for input and output, we can use `scanf` and `printf`. `scanf` and `printf` are generally faster than `cin` and `cout` for reading and writing integers.
3. Instead of using `vector` and `pair` for storing and manipulating the data, we can use arrays. Arrays have a lower memory overhead compared to vectors and pairs.
4. Avoid unnecessary calculations and variable assignments inside the loop.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <cstdio>
#include <algorithm>

int main() {
  int T;
  scanf("%d", &T);
  
  while (T--) {
    int N;
    scanf("%d", &N);
    
    int v[N][2];
    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
      int M;
      scanf("%d", &M);
      
      int start = 0;
      int mx[M];
      for (int j = 0; j < M; j++) {
        int x;
        scanf("%d", &x);
        mx[j] = x - j + 1;
      }
      
      start = *std::max_element(mx, mx + M);
      int end = M + start;
      v[i][0] = start;
      v[i][1] = end;
    }
    
    std::sort(v, v + N);
    
    int start = 0;
    int end = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
      if (v[i][0] >= end) {
        int diff = v[i][0] - end;
        start += diff;
        end = v[i][1];
      } else {
        int diff = end - v[i][0];
        end = v[i][1] + diff;
      }
    }
    
    printf("%d\n", start);
  }
}
```
