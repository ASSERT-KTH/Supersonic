To optimize the given C/C++ program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The program includes `<bits/stdc++.h>`, which is not necessary. We can remove it.

2. Use `int` instead of `long long int` where possible: The program uses `long long int` for loop counters and variables. Since the input constraints are not specified, we can assume that `int` will be sufficient for these variables.

3. Avoid unnecessary vector copying: The program creates a vector `mx` in each iteration of the inner loop and then finds the maximum element using `max_element`. We can avoid this by keeping track of the maximum element while reading the input values.

4. Use `emplace_back` instead of `push_back`: Instead of creating a pair using `{start, end}` and then pushing it into the vector `v`, we can directly use `emplace_back` to construct the pair in-place.

5. Avoid sorting the entire vector: After constructing the vector `v`, the program sorts it using `sort`. Instead of sorting the entire vector, we can find the maximum end position directly in a single pass.

6. Use `int` instead of `long long int` for start and end variables: Since the start and end positions are calculated based on the maximum difference, we can use `int` instead of `long long int` for these variables.

Here's the optimized C++ program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int T;
  cin >> T;
  while (T--) {
    int N;
    cin >> N;
    vector<pair<int, int>> v;
    int start = 0;
    int end = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
      int M;
      cin >> M;
      int maxDiff = 0;
      for (int j = 0; j < M; j++) {
        int x;
        cin >> x;
        maxDiff = max(maxDiff, x - j + 1);
      }
      int currentEnd = M + maxDiff;
      v.emplace_back(maxDiff, currentEnd);
      end = max(end, currentEnd);
    }
    int totalDiff = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
      if (v[i].first >= end) {
        int diff = v[i].first - end;
        start += diff;
        end = v[i].second;
      } else {
        int diff = end - v[i].first;
        end = v[i].second + diff;
      }
    }
    cout << start << "\n";
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Explanation of optimizations:
1. Removed unnecessary includes.
2. Changed `long long int` to `int` where possible.
3. Removed unnecessary vector copying and used a single pass to find the maximum difference.
4. Used `emplace_back` instead of `push_back`.
5. Avoided sorting the entire vector and found the maximum end position directly.
6. Used `int` instead of `long long int` for start and end variables.
