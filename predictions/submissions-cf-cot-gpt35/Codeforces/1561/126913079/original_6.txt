The given program can be optimized in the following steps:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The program includes the entire standard library header `<bits/stdc++.h>`. This can be replaced with specific headers that are actually required by the program.

2. Use `int` instead of `long long int` when possible: The program uses `long long int` for variables that don't require such a large range. Switching to `int` can save memory.

3. Avoid unnecessary vector creation: The program creates a vector `mx` to store some values but it is not required. Instead, we can calculate the maximum element directly without storing all the elements.

4. Optimize the sorting: The program uses `sort` to sort the vector `v`. However, we can optimize this step by using a custom comparator that compares the `end` values of the pairs. This way, we can avoid sorting the entire vector and use a partial sort instead.

5. Avoid unnecessary calculations in the second loop: The second loop calculates the difference between `end` and `v[i].first` multiple times. We can optimize this by calculating it only once and reusing the value.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

int main() {
  int T;
  std::cin >> T;
  while (T--) {
    int N;
    std::cin >> N;
    std::vector<std::pair<int, int>> v;
    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
      int M;
      std::cin >> M;
      int start = 0;
      int max_diff = INT_MIN;
      for (int j = 0; j < M; j++) {
        int x;
        std::cin >> x;
        int diff = x - j + 1;
        if (diff > max_diff) {
          max_diff = diff;
        }
      }
      int end = M + max_diff;
      v.push_back({start, end});
    }
    std::partial_sort(v.begin(), v.begin() + 1, v.end(),
                      [](const std::pair<int, int>& a, const std::pair<int, int>& b) {
                        return a.second < b.second;
                      });
    int start = 0;
    int end = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
      if (v[i].first >= end) {
        int diff = v[i].first - end;
        start += diff;
        end = v[i].second;
      } else {
        int diff = end - v[i].first;
        end = v[i].second + diff;
      }
    }
    std::cout << start << "\n";
  }
}
```
