Explanation of the optimization steps:

1. Avoid unnecessary includes: The program includes the entire `<bits/stdc++.h>` library, which is not necessary and can slow down the compilation process. We can replace it with the necessary standard headers.

2. Use `int` instead of `long long int` where possible: The program uses `long long int` for many variables, which may not be necessary. Using `int` instead can save memory and potentially improve performance.

3. Avoid unnecessary vector creation: The program creates a vector `mx` inside the inner loop, which is not necessary. We can calculate the maximum element directly without using a vector.

4. Avoid unnecessary sorting: The program sorts the vector `v` at the end, which is not necessary for finding the minimum start position. We can iterate over the vector to find the minimum start position without sorting.

5. Simplify the calculation of `start` and `end`: The program calculates `start` and `end` in two separate loops. We can simplify the calculation by updating `start` and `end` in a single loop.

Optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int T;
  cin >> T;
  while (T--) {
    int N;
    cin >> N;
    vector<pair<int, int>> v;
    int start = 0;
    int end = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
      int M;
      cin >> M;
      int mx = -1;
      for (int j = 0; j < M; j++) {
        int x;
        cin >> x;
        mx = max(mx, x - j + 1);
      }
      int cur_end = M + mx;
      v.push_back({mx, cur_end});
      if (mx >= end) {
        start += mx - end;
        end = cur_end;
      } else {
        end += cur_end - mx;
      }
    }
    cout << start << endl;
  }
}
```

Explanation of the optimized program:

1. Replaced the unnecessary `<bits/stdc++.h>` include with the necessary headers `<iostream>`, `<vector>`, and `<algorithm>`.

2. Replaced `long long int` with `int` where possible to save memory.

3. Removed the unnecessary vector `mx` and directly calculated the maximum element `mx` inside the inner loop.

4. Removed the unnecessary sorting of the vector `v` and updated the calculation of `start` and `end` in a single loop.

5. Replaced `"\n"` with `endl` for better compatibility with different systems.
