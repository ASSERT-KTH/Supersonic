The given program is finding a matching or independent set in a graph. It reads the number of test cases, the number of vertices, and the number of edges for each test case. Then it constructs an adjacency list representation of the graph and finds a matching or independent set using a greedy algorithm.

To optimize the program, we can make the following improvements:

1. Remove unnecessary header files: The program includes many unnecessary header files. We can remove most of them since they are not used in the program.

2. Remove unused variables: The program defines variables `r`, `c`, `p`, and `mod` but they are not used anywhere in the program. We can remove these variables to improve readability.

3. Use vectors instead of arrays: The program uses arrays for `r`, `c`, and `p`, but we can use vectors instead. Vectors provide dynamic size allocation and bounds checking, which can simplify the code.

4. Avoid unnecessary clearing of vectors: The program clears the `matching` vector and `adj` vectors in each test case. However, since these vectors are being reassigned immediately after clearing, we can remove the clearing step to save unnecessary computation.

5. Use iterators directly: The program uses an iterator `it` to iterate over the adjacency list. We can use the range-based for loop directly on the adjacency list to simplify the code.

6. Remove unnecessary `memset`: The program uses `memset` to set the `match` array to all false values. However, we can remove this step since the `match` array is already initialized to false when it is declared.

7. Use a more efficient algorithm: The current algorithm finds a matching or independent set using a greedy approach. However, this may not always find the optimal solution. We can improve the algorithm by using a more efficient algorithm such as maximum cardinality matching or maximum independent set.

Based on these optimizations, the optimized program is shown below:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(0);
  cout.tie(0);

  int t;
  cin >> t;

  while (t--) {
    int n, m;
    cin >> n >> m;

    vector<vector<pair<int, int>>> adj(3 * n + 1);
    vector<bool> match(3 * n + 1, false);
    vector<int> matching;
    
    for (int i = 1; i <= m; i++) {
      int x, y;
      cin >> x >> y;
      adj[x].push_back(make_pair(y, i));
    }

    for (int i = 1; i <= 3 * n; i++) {
      if (match[i]) {
        continue;
      }
      
      for (auto it : adj[i]) {
        int nd = it.first;
        int ed = it.second;
        
        if (!match[nd]) {
          matching.push_back(ed);
          match[nd] = true;
          match[i] = true;
          break;
        }
      }
    }

    if (matching.size() >= n) {
      cout << "Matching" << '\n';
      for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        cout << matching[i] << " ";
      }
      cout << '\n';
    } else {
      vector<int> v;
      for (int i = 1; i <= 3 * n; i++) {
        if (!match[i]) {
          v.push_back(i);
        }
      }

      if (v.size() >= n) {
        cout << "IndSet" << '\n';
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
          cout << v[i] << " ";
        }
      } else {
        cout << "Impossible";
      }

      cout << '\n';
    }
  }

  return 0;
}
```

Explanation:
- We removed unnecessary header files and unused variables to improve readability.
- We replaced arrays with vectors for `adj`, `match`, and `matching` to simplify the code and improve memory management.
- We removed unnecessary clearing of vectors to save computation.
- We used a range-based for loop directly on the adjacency list to simplify the code.
- We removed the unnecessary `memset` step since the `match` array is already initialized to false when declared.
- We kept the original algorithm for finding matching or independent set, but noted that it may not always find the optimal solution.
