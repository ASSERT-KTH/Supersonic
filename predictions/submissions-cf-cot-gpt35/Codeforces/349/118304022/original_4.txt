Step 1: Remove unnecessary include statement
- The current program includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header, which is not necessary for this program. This header includes a large number of other headers, which can increase the compile time and memory usage. Since this program does not require any specific headers, we can remove this line.

Step 2: Remove unnecessary array declaration
- The current program declares an array `a` of size `n`, where `n` is input by the user. However, this array is not used for any specific purpose and can be removed.

Step 3: Use a set instead of multiset
- The current program uses a `multiset` to store the coins. However, since we only need to store the unique coins and their counts do not matter, we can use a `set` instead. This will reduce the memory usage and improve the performance.

Step 4: Remove unnecessary check for `ret` in the loop
- The current program checks if `ret` is non-zero in the loop, which is not necessary. The loop will only execute if `ret` is non-zero, so the check can be removed.

Step 5: Simplify the loop logic
- The current program uses a nested loop to iterate over the coins and subtract them from `ret`. However, we can simplify this logic by using a single loop and checking if `ret` is greater than or equal to the current coin. If it is, we subtract the coin and erase it from the set.

Step 6: Use `const auto&` instead of `const int&` in the range-based for loop
- The current program uses `const int&` in the range-based for loop, but it can be simplified to `const auto&` to improve readability.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <set>
using namespace std;

#define verdict (ok ? "YES" : "NO")

int main() {
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  set<int, greater<>> st;
  const int coins[] = {75, 50, 25};
  bool ok = true;

  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    int val;
    cin >> val;
    int ret = val - 25;
    if (ret) {
      for (int coin : coins) {
        if (ret >= coin && st.count(coin)) {
          ret -= coin;
          st.erase(st.find(coin));
        }
      }
      if (ret) {
        ok = false;
        break;
      }
    }
    st.insert(val);
  }

  cout << verdict << '\n';
  return 0;
}
```
