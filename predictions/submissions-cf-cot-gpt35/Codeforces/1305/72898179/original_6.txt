The given program is finding the minimum cost to transform an array of numbers into a number x by adding or subtracting 1 from each element. The cost is calculated as the sum of absolute differences between the elements and x.

To optimize the program for running time and memory usage, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary include statements: The program includes `<bits/stdc++.h>` which includes all the standard library headers. This can be replaced with the specific headers that are actually used in the program, such as `<cstdio>`, `<algorithm>`, `<map>`, and `<ctime>`.

2. Remove unnecessary macros: The program defines macros for loop iterations (`fo`, `ff`, `fd`). These macros can be replaced with regular for loops, which are more readable and less error-prone.

3. Remove unused variables: The variable `M` is defined but not used. We can safely remove it.

4. Use `vector` instead of `map` for storing prime factors: The program uses a `map` to store the prime factors of a number. However, we only need to store the prime factors, not their counts. So, we can use a `vector` instead, which will be more memory efficient.

5. Avoid unnecessary calculations: The program calculates the prime factors of a number multiple times. We can optimize this by calculating the prime factors once and then reusing the result.

6. Optimize the loop iterations: The program iterates over all possible values of `x` and checks the cost for each value. We can optimize this by iterating only over the unique prime factors of the elements in the array.

7. Optimize the cost calculation: The program calculates the cost for each value of `x` by iterating over all elements in the array. We can optimize this by calculating the cost in a single pass, without iterating over the array multiple times.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <cstdio>
#include <algorithm>
#include <vector>
#include <ctime>

const int N = 2e5 + 5;

int n;
long long a[N];
std::vector<int> p;

void sieve(int n) {
  std::vector<bool> bz(n + 1, false);
  for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
    if (!bz[i])
      p.push_back(i);
    for (int j = 0; j < p.size() && i * p[j] <= n; j++) {
      int k = i * p[j];
      bz[k] = true;
      if (i % p[j] == 0)
        break;
    }
  }
}

void fen(long long n, std::vector<int>& u) {
  u.clear();
  for (int i = 0; i < p.size() && (long long)p[i] * p[i] <= n; i++) {
    if (n % p[i] == 0) {
      u.push_back(p[i]);
      while (n % p[i] == 0)
        n /= p[i];
    }
  }
  if (n > 1)
    u.push_back(n);
}

long long check(long long x) {
  long long s = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    if (a[i] >= x) {
      long long y = a[i] % x;
      s += std::min(y, x - y);
    } else {
      s += x - a[i];
    }
  }
  return s;
}

int main() {
  std::srand(std::time(0) + std::clock());
  sieve(1e6);

  std::scanf("%d", &n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    std::scanf("%lld", &a[i]);
  }

  std::random_shuffle(a, a + n);

  std::vector<int> u;
  for (int i = 0; i < std::min(n, 1000); i++) {
    for (int j = -1; j <= 1; j++) {
      long long x = a[i] + j;
      if (x > 1) {
        fen(x, u);
      }
    }
  }

  long long ans = n;
  for (int i = 0; i < u.size(); i++) {
    ans = std::min(ans, check(u[i]));
  }

  std::printf("%lld\n", ans);
}
