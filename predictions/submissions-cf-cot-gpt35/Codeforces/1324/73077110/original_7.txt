Step 1: Remove unnecessary header files
The program includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header file, which includes a large number of other header files. This can slow down the compilation process and increase memory usage. Since the program does not use any specific features from these header files, we can remove it.

Step 2: Remove unnecessary macros
The program defines several macros that are not used. We can remove them to simplify the code.

Step 3: Avoid unnecessary vector copies
The program creates two vectors `v` and `v1` to store the differences between corresponding elements of `a` and `b` arrays. However, these vectors are not used after sorting. We can avoid creating these vectors and directly sort the elements in the `a` and `b` arrays.

Step 4: Use pointers instead of iterators
The program uses iterators to find the upper bound of a value in a vector. However, using pointers can be faster and more efficient. We can modify the code to use pointers instead of iterators.

Below is the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

void solve() {
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  int a[n], b[n];
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    cin >> a[i];
  }
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    cin >> b[i];
    a[i] -= b[i];
    b[i] -= a[i];
  }
  sort(a, a + n);
  sort(b, b + n);
  int ans = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    int* it = upper_bound(a, a + n, b[i]);
    if (it == a + n) {
      continue;
    }
    int temp = a + n - it;
    if (b[i] < 0)
      temp--;
    ans += temp;
  }
  cout << ans / 2 << endl;
}

int main() {
  int T = 1;
  while (T--) {
    solve();
  }
  return 0;
}
```
