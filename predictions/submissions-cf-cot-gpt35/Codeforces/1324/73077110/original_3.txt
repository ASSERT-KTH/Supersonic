The given program calculates the number of pairs of elements in two arrays such that the difference between the elements in each pair is greater than a given value. The program uses two vectors `v` and `v1` to store the differences between corresponding elements of the two arrays. It then sorts these vectors and counts the number of pairs using an upper bound search.

To optimize this program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary headers: The program includes the `bits/stdc++.h` header, which includes all standard library headers. This can slow down compilation time. We can remove this line and include only the necessary headers.

2. Remove unnecessary macros: The program defines macros for `ll`, `IOS`, `deb`, `endl`, and `int`. These macros are not used in the program, so we can remove them.

3. Use `std::array` instead of variable-length arrays: The program uses variable-length arrays `a` and `b` to store the input arrays. Variable-length arrays are not part of standard C++, and their use can lead to unpredictable behavior. We can use `std::array` instead, which is a safer alternative.

4. Use `std::vector` instead of `std::array` for `v` and `v1`: The program uses `std::vector` for `v` and `v1`, but it specifies the size of these vectors based on the input size `n`. We can remove the size specification and let `std::vector` manage the memory dynamically.

5. Sort `v` and `v1` in descending order: The program sorts `v` and `v1` in ascending order. Since we are interested in finding pairs with a difference greater than a given value, it would be more efficient to sort these vectors in descending order.

6. Use a binary search instead of `std::upper_bound`: The program uses `std::upper_bound` to find the position of the first element greater than `v1[i]` in `v`. This can be replaced with a binary search, which has a lower time complexity.

7. Use integer division instead of floating-point division: The program divides `ans` by 2 using floating-point division. Since `ans` is an integer, we can use integer division (`/`) instead, which is faster.

With these optimizations, the optimized program would look like this:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

void solve() {
    int n;
    std::cin >> n;
    std::vector<int> a(n), b(n), v, v1;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        std::cin >> a[i];
    }
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        std::cin >> b[i];
        v.push_back(a[i] - b[i]);
        v1.push_back(b[i] - a[i]);
    }
    std::sort(v.begin(), v.end(), std::greater<int>());
    std::sort(v1.begin(), v1.end(), std::greater<int>());
    int ans = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        auto it = std::lower_bound(v.begin(), v.end(), v1[i], std::greater<int>());
        if (it == v.end()) {
            continue;
        }
        int temp = v.end() - it;
        if (v1[i] < 0) {
            temp--;
        }
        ans += temp;
    }
    std::cout << ans / 2 << '\n';
}

int main() {
    std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    std::cin.tie(NULL);
    std::cout.tie(NULL);
    int T = 1;
    while (T--) {
        solve();
    }
    return 0;
}
```

This optimized program eliminates unnecessary headers and macros, uses safer alternatives for variable-length arrays, sorts the vectors in descending order, uses a binary search, and uses integer division. These optimizations should improve the running time and memory usage of the program.
