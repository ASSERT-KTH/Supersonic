The given program can be optimized in the following steps:
1. Remove unnecessary header file inclusion: The program includes `<bits/stdc++.h>` which includes a large number of standard C++ library headers. This can increase the compilation time and unnecessary memory usage. We can remove this and include only the necessary headers.
2. Remove unnecessary macros: The program defines macros for `ll`, `IOS`, `deb`, `endl`, and `M`. These macros are not used in the program and can be removed.
3. Use `int` instead of `ll`: The program uses `ll` as the data type for variables `n`, `a`, `b`, `v`, `v1`, and `ans`. We can use `int` instead of `ll` for these variables to save memory.
4. Avoid using `std::vector`: The program uses `std::vector` for `v` and `v1`. However, we can avoid using vectors and use arrays instead, as the size of these arrays is fixed and known at compile time.
5. Avoid sorting `v1` array: The program sorts both `v` and `v1` arrays. However, we can avoid sorting the `v1` array, as it is not used in the calculation of the answer. This can save time.
6. Use binary search instead of `upper_bound`: The program uses `upper_bound` to find the first element greater than `v1[i]` in the `v` array. We can use binary search instead of `upper_bound`, as the `v` array is sorted. This can improve the time complexity.

Here is the optimized C++ program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

void solve() {
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  int a[n], b[n];
  int v[n], v1[n];
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    cin >> a[i];
  }
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    cin >> b[i];
    v[i] = a[i] - b[i];
    v1[i] = b[i] - a[i];
  }
  sort(v, v + n);

  int ans = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    int low = 0, high = n - 1;
    int temp = 0;
    while (low <= high) {
      int mid = (low + high) / 2;
      if (v[mid] > v1[i]) {
        temp = n - mid;
        high = mid - 1;
      } else {
        low = mid + 1;
      }
    }
    if (v1[i] < 0)
      temp--;
    ans += temp;
  }
  cout << ans / 2 << endl;
}

int main() {
  int T = 1;
  while (T--) {
    solve();
  }
  return 0;
}
```
