The given program reads an integer `t` as the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and then `n` integers. It counts the number of odd and even integers and checks if the product of their counts is non-zero. If the product is non-zero, it prints "NO", otherwise it prints "YES".

To optimize the program, we can make the following changes:

1. Remove unnecessary input/output synchronization using `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0)`, `cin.tie(0)`, and `cout.tie(0)`. This synchronization is not needed in this program and can be safely removed.

2. Remove the file input/output redirection using `freopen`. This is only necessary for testing purposes and can be removed for the optimized program.

3. Instead of counting the number of odd and even integers, we can keep track of whether we have seen at least one odd and at least one even integer. We don't need to know the counts, only their presence. This will save memory and runtime by avoiding unnecessary counting.

4. Instead of checking the product of odd and even counts, we can simply check if both odd and even integers have been seen. If we have seen both, the product will be non-zero, otherwise it will be zero.

5. Instead of printing "YES" or "NO" directly, we can store the result in a variable and print it after the loop. This will reduce the number of output operations, which can improve performance.

Here is the optimized C++ program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int t, n, tmp;
  cin >> t;
  
  while (t--) {
    cin >> n;
    bool odd = false, even = false;
    
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      cin >> tmp;
      if (tmp & 1)
        odd = true;
      else
        even = true;
    }
    
    string result = (odd && even) ? "NO" : "YES";
    cout << result << "\n";
  }
  
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized program removes unnecessary input/output synchronization and file redirection. It keeps track of whether odd and even integers have been seen instead of counting their occurrences. It checks if both odd and even integers have been seen to determine the result. It stores the result in a variable before printing it.
