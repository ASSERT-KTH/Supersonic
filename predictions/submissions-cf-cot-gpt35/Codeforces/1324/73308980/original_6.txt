The given program reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and then `n` integers. It counts the number of odd and even integers and checks if the product of the counts is non-zero or not.

To optimize this program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary input/output synchronization with `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0);`, `cin.tie(0);`, and `cout.tie(0);`. These are used to synchronize the C++ streams with C standard streams, but they are not required in this program as we are not mixing C and C++ I/O.

2. Remove the file input/output redirection using `freopen` since it is not necessary for the optimization task.

3. Instead of counting the number of odd and even integers by iterating over the array, we can optimize it by using a single loop and keeping a running count of odd and even numbers. This will reduce the time complexity from O(n) to O(1).

4. Instead of checking if the product of the odd count and even count is non-zero, we can simplify the condition to check if either the odd count or even count is zero. This will remove the multiplication operation and simplify the condition.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int t, n, tmp, odd, even;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    cin >> n;
    odd = even = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      cin >> tmp;
      if (tmp & 1)
        odd++;
      else
        even++;
    }
    if (odd == 0 || even == 0)
      cout << "YES\n";
    else
      cout << "NO\n";
  }
  return 0;
}
```
