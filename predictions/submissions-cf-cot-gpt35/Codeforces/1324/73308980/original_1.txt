Step 1: Remove unnecessary input/output optimizations

The original program includes the following lines of code for input/output optimization:
```
ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0);
cin.tie(0);
cout.tie(0);
```
These lines are unnecessary for this program since it does not involve heavy input/output operations. We can remove these lines to simplify the code.

Step 2: Optimize the loop condition

The loop condition in the original program is `t--`, which means the loop will continue until `t` becomes zero. However, we can optimize this condition to `t > 0` to simplify the loop condition.

Step 3: Remove unnecessary variables

The original program includes two variables `odd` and `even` to keep track of the count of odd and even numbers. However, these variables are only used to check if `odd * even` is non-zero. We can replace these variables with a single boolean variable `isYes` to track if the condition is met.

Step 4: Simplify the output condition

The original program checks if `odd * even` is non-zero to determine the output. We can simplify this condition by checking if `odd` or `even` is non-zero. If either of them is non-zero, then the condition is met and we output "YES", otherwise we output "NO".

Step 5: Generate the optimized program

Here is the optimized program after applying the described optimizations:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
#ifndef ONLINE_JUDGE
  freopen("input.txt", "r", stdin);
  freopen("output.txt", "w", stdout);
#endif

  int t, n, tmp;
  cin >> t;

  while (t > 0) {
    cin >> n;
    bool isYes = false;

    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      cin >> tmp;
      if (tmp % 2 != 0) {
        isYes = true;
        break;
      }
    }

    if (isYes)
      cout << "YES\n";
    else
      cout << "NO\n";

    t--;
  }

  return 0;
}
```

This optimized program simplifies the code by removing unnecessary input/output optimizations, optimizing the loop condition, removing unnecessary variables, and simplifying the output condition. These optimizations help improve the running time and memory usage of the program.
