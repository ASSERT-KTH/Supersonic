Explanation of the optimization steps:

1. Remove unnecessary include statements: The program only uses `iostream`, so we can remove other unnecessary include statements.

2. Remove unnecessary `using namespace std;`: Instead of using the `using namespace std;` directive, we can qualify the usage of `cin`, `cout`, and `endl` with the `std::` prefix to avoid namespace pollution.

3. Remove unnecessary input/output optimizations: The program sets `sync_with_stdio(0)` and `tie(0)` for input/output optimizations, but these optimizations are not needed for this particular program. We can remove these statements.

4. Remove file input/output redirection: The program checks if it is running in an online judge environment and redirects input from "input.txt" and output to "output.txt" accordingly. For this optimization task, we can assume that the program will run without file redirection, so we can remove these statements.

5. Optimize the counting of odd and even numbers: Instead of using separate variables `odd` and `even` to count odd and even numbers, we can use a single variable `oddCount` to count the number of odd numbers. The number of even numbers can be calculated as `n - oddCount`. This avoids unnecessary comparisons and assignments.

6. Optimize the check for odd and even products: Instead of checking if `odd * even` is non-zero, we can directly check if `oddCount` is equal to 0 or equal to `n`. If `oddCount` is equal to 0, it means there are no odd numbers, so the product will be 0. If `oddCount` is equal to `n`, it means there are no even numbers, so the product will also be 0. This avoids unnecessary multiplications.

7. Remove unnecessary `return 0;`: The `return 0;` statement at the end of `main()` is not necessary in C++. The compiler will automatically insert it if it is missing.

Optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  int t, n, tmp, oddCount;
  std::cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    std::cin >> n;
    oddCount = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      std::cin >> tmp;
      if (tmp & 1)
        oddCount++;
    }
    if (oddCount == 0 || oddCount == n)
      std::cout << "NO\n";
    else
      std::cout << "YES\n";
  }
}
```
