The given program seems to be using a lot of unnecessary libraries and preprocessor directives. We can optimize it by removing these unnecessary parts and simplifying the code.

Here are the optimization steps:

1. Remove unnecessary libraries: The program includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` library, which is not a standard library and can be slow. We can remove this library and include only the necessary standard libraries.

2. Remove unnecessary typedefs: The program includes multiple typedefs that are not used. We can remove these typedefs to simplify the code.

3. Remove unnecessary macros: The program includes macros for debugging and printing, which are not used. We can remove these macros to simplify the code.

4. Remove unnecessary comments: The program includes comments that are not necessary for the optimization. We can remove these comments to simplify the code.

5. Simplify variable initialization: The program initializes some variables unnecessarily. We can simplify the variable initialization to improve readability.

6. Simplify variable names: The program uses variable names that are not descriptive. We can rename the variables to improve readability.

7. Simplify the logic for finding the missing elements: The program uses a while loop to find the missing elements. We can simplify this logic by using a for loop instead.

8. Simplify the printing of the output: The program uses a for loop to print the output. We can simplify this by using the `copy` function from the `<algorithm>` library.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <set>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);

  int n;
  cin >> n;
  
  vector<int> v(n);
  set<int> s;

  for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> v[i];
    s.insert(v[i]);

    if(v[i] > i + 1) {
      cout << -1 << '\n';
      return 0;
    }
  }

  vector<int> ans(n, -1);
  int start = 1;

  for(int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
    if(v[i - 1] != v[i]) {
      ans[i] = v[i - 1];
    }
  }

  for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    if(ans[i] == -1) {
      while(s.find(start) != s.end()) {
        start++;
      }
      ans[i] = start++;
    }
  }

  copy(ans.begin(), ans.end(), ostream_iterator<int>(cout, " "));
  cout << '\n';

  return 0;
}
```

This optimized program removes unnecessary libraries, typedefs, macros, and comments, simplifies variable initialization and names, and simplifies the logic for finding missing elements and printing the output.
