The given C/C++ program is attempting to solve a problem, but it can be optimized for both running time and memory usage. 

Here are the steps to optimize the program:

1. Remove unnecessary `#include` directives: The program includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header, which is not a standard C++ header and may not be available on all systems. We can remove this unnecessary include directive.

2. Remove unnecessary `typedef` statements: The program includes several `typedef` statements that define aliases for various types. However, these aliases are not used in the program. We can remove these unnecessary `typedef` statements.

3. Remove unnecessary `unordered_map` and `map` headers: The program includes the `<unordered_map>` and `<map>` headers, but these headers are not used in the program. We can remove these unnecessary include directives.

4. Remove unnecessary `define` directives: The program includes several `#define` directives that define macros for various purposes. However, these macros are not used in the program. We can remove these unnecessary `#define` directives.

5. Use a more efficient data structure: The program uses a `set` to check if a number already exists in the input vector. However, searching in a `set` has a time complexity of O(log n). We can use a `vector<bool>` instead, which has a time complexity of O(1) for lookup operations.

6. Simplify the logic for generating the answer vector: The program uses a nested loop to generate the answer vector. We can simplify the logic by using a single loop and a counter variable to keep track of the next available number.

7. Optimize the output: The program currently outputs each element of the answer vector using a separate `cout` statement. We can optimize this by using a `stringstream` to build the output string and then outputting the entire string at once.

Here is the optimized C/C++ program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <set>
#include <sstream>

int main() {
    std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    std::cin.tie(NULL);

    int n;
    std::cin >> n;

    std::vector<int> v(n);
    std::vector<bool> exists(n+1, false);

    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        std::cin >> v[i];
        exists[v[i]] = true;
        if (v[i] > i + 1) {
            std::cout << -1 << '\n';
            return 0;
        }
    }

    std::vector<int> ans(n, -1);
    int start = 1;

    for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
        if (v[i - 1] != v[i]) {
            ans[i] = v[i - 1];
        }
    }

    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (ans[i] == -1) {
            while (exists[start]) {
                start++;
            }
            ans[i] = start++;
        }
    }

    std::stringstream ss;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        ss << ans[i] << ' ';
    }
    std::cout << ss.str() << '\n';

    return 0;
}
