Step 1: Remove unnecessary includes and define statements.

The program includes unnecessary headers like `<bits/stdc++.h>` and `<cstdio>`. We can remove these includes as they are not used in the program.

Similarly, there are some unnecessary define statements like `In`, `NO`, `m1`, etc. We can remove these defines as well.

Step 2: Remove unused variables.

The program declares some variables that are not used later in the code. We can safely remove these variables to improve the code readability.

Step 3: Remove unnecessary vector and array declarations.

The program declares some vectors and arrays that are not used later in the code. We can remove these declarations to reduce memory usage.

Step 4: Remove unnecessary loop variables.

The program uses loop variables like `i` in multiple loops, even if they are not used. We can remove these loop variables to improve code readability.

Step 5: Optimize the logic for creating the vector `v`.

The program creates a vector `v` based on some conditions. We can optimize this logic by using a single loop instead of two loops. This will reduce the number of iterations and improve the running time of the program.

Step 6: Optimize the output of vector `v`.

The program outputs the elements of vector `v` using a loop and cout statements. We can optimize this output by using a single cout statement and the copy function of the vector. This will reduce the number of output statements and improve the running time of the program.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(0);
    
    int t;
    cin >> t;
    
    while (t--) {
        int n;
        cin >> n;
        
        vector<int> a(n);
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            cin >> a[i];
        }
        
        vector<int> v;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (i == 0 || i == n - 1 || (a[i - 1] < a[i]) != (a[i] < a[i + 1])) {
                v.push_back(a[i]);
            }
        }
        
        cout << v.size() << endl;
        copy(v.begin(), v.end(), ostream_iterator<int>(cout, " "));
        cout << endl;
    }
    
    return 0;
}
```

This optimized program removes unnecessary includes and defines, removes unused variables and declarations, optimizes the logic for creating the vector `v`, and optimizes the output of vector `v`. These optimizations improve the running time and memory usage of the program.
