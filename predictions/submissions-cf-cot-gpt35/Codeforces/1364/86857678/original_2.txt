Step 1: Remove unnecessary header files

The program includes several unnecessary header files such as `<bits/stdc++.h>` and `<string>`. These header files are not used in the program and can be removed.

Step 2: Remove unnecessary macros

The program defines several unnecessary macros such as `In`, `NO`, `m1`, `No`, `YES`, `Yes`, `pb`, `bug`, `all`, and `sz`. These macros are not used in the program and can be removed.

Step 3: Remove unused variables

The program declares several unused variables such as `b`, `aa`, `k`, `ev`, `od`, `tt`, `edge`, `l`, `c2`, `ok`, `chid`, `dp`, and `f`. These variables are not used in the program and can be removed.

Step 4: Optimize the `dfs` function

The `dfs` function is called recursively and can be optimized by using a depth-first search algorithm. We can remove the `ok` variable and return a boolean value indicating whether the destination node is reached or not.

Step 5: Optimize the main loop

The main loop can be optimized by removing the unnecessary vector `v2` and the unused variables `mx`, `mn`, and `x`. We can also avoid using the `vector<ll>` type and instead use the `vector<int>` type for `v` since it only stores integers.

Step 6: Optimize the output

The program outputs the size of the vector `v` and its elements. We can optimize this by using a single loop to output both the size and the elements of the vector.

Here's the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

bool dfs(int s, int des, int arr[], vector<int> vec[]) {
  arr[s] = 1;
  if (s == des) {
    return true;
  }
  for (int i = 0; i < vec[s].size(); i++) {
    if (!arr[vec[s][i]]) {
      if (dfs(vec[s][i], des, arr, vec)) {
        return true;
      }
    }
  }
  return false;
}

int main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(0);
  
  int t;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    int n;
    cin >> n;
    
    vector<int> a(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      cin >> a[i];
    }
    
    vector<int> v;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      if (i == 0 || i == n - 1 || (a[i - 1] < a[i]) != (a[i] < a[i + 1])) {
        v.push_back(a[i]);
      }
    }
    
    cout << v.size() << endl;
    for (int i = 0; i < v.size(); i++) {
      cout << v[i] << " ";
    }
    cout << endl;
  }
  
  return 0;
}
```
After optimization, the program should have improved running time and reduced memory usage.
