Step 1: Remove unnecessary includes
- The `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` includes a large number of standard library headers, which can slow down compilation and increase memory usage. It is generally better to include only the specific headers that are needed. In this case, we can remove this line since it is not used in the program.

Step 2: Remove unused typedefs
- The typedefs for `vpii`, `vpll`, `vvi`, `vvll`, `vvull` are not used in the program. We can remove them to simplify the code.

Step 3: Optimize unordered_map initialization
- In the current code, the unordered_map `d` is initialized with a custom_hash function. However, we can optimize this by using the default hash function for `ll` type.
- We can replace `unordered_map<ll, ll, custom_hash> d;` with `unordered_map<ll, ll> d;`.

Step 4: Optimize queue initialization
- In the current code, the queue `q` is initialized by pushing each element of the vector `v` onto it. However, we can optimize this by directly initializing the queue with the vector `v`.
- We can replace the for loop and queue initialization with `queue<ll> q(v.begin(), v.end());`.

Step 5: Optimize res vector initialization
- In the current code, the vector `res` is initialized as an empty vector and then elements are pushed into it using `push_back()`. However, we can optimize this by reserving enough space for `m` elements.
- We can replace `vll res;` with `vll res; res.reserve(m);`.

Step 6: Remove unnecessary check for res.size()
- In the current code, there is a check for `res.size() == m` inside the while loop. However, since `m` is a constant, we can remove this check and change the while loop condition to `res.size() < m`.

Step 7: Optimize shuffle
- In the current code, the vector `res` is shuffled using `shuffle()` function from the `<algorithm>` library. However, we can optimize this by using a partial_sort to select the first `m` elements.
- We can replace `shuffle(res.begin(), res.end(), rng);` with `partial_sort(res.begin(), res.begin() + m, res.end(), rng);`.

Here's the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <queue>
#include <algorithm>
#include <random>
using namespace std;

typedef long long ll;
typedef vector<int> vi;
typedef vector<ll> vll;

struct custom_hash {
    static uint64_t splitmix64(uint64_t x) {
        x += 0x9e3779b97f4a7c15;
        x = (x ^ (x >> 30)) * 0xbf58476d1ce4e5b9;
        x = (x ^ (x >> 27)) * 0x94d049bb133111eb;
        return x ^ (x >> 31);
    }
    size_t operator()(uint64_t x) const {
        static const uint64_t FIXED_RANDOM = 
            chrono::steady_clock::now().time_since_epoch().count();
        return splitmix64(x + FIXED_RANDOM);
    }
};

mt19937 rng(time(0));

void solve() {
    int n, m;
    cin >> n >> m;
    vi v(n);
    for (auto &x : v)
        cin >> x;
    
    unordered_map<ll, ll> d;
    queue<ll> q(v.begin(), v.end());

    vll res;
    res.reserve(m);
    ll mini_sum = 0LL;

    while (!q.empty() && res.size() < m) {
        ll cur = q.front();
        q.pop();
        if (d[cur] != 0) {
            res.push_back(cur);
            mini_sum += d[cur];
        }
        if (!d.count(cur - 1)) {
            d[cur - 1] = d[cur] + 1;
            q.push(cur - 1);
        }
        if (!d.count(cur + 1)) {
            d[cur + 1] = d[cur] + 1;
            q.push(cur + 1);
        }
    }

    partial_sort(res.begin(), res.begin() + m, res.end(), rng);

    cout << mini_sum << "\n";
    for (auto x : res)
        cout << x << " ";
    cout << "\n";
}

int main() {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false), cin.tie(nullptr), cout.tie(nullptr);
    int t = 1;
    while (t--) {
        solve();
    }
    return 0;
}
```

The optimized code makes several modifications to improve performance and reduce memory usage. The unnecessary includes and typedefs are removed. The unordered_map and queue are initialized more efficiently. The res vector is pre-allocated with enough space. The check for res.size() is removed and replaced with a partial_sort to select the first m elements.
