Optimization Steps:
1. Remove unnecessary header files: The program includes `<bits/stdc++.h>` which is a non-standard header file and includes a lot of other header files. This can increase the compilation time and memory usage. We can remove this and include the necessary header files individually.
2. Remove unnecessary typedefs: The program includes a lot of typedefs for various types. These can be removed as they are not used in the program.
3. Remove unnecessary macros: The program defines macros for various constants and functions. These can be replaced with their actual values or used directly in the code.
4. Use reserve() function for vectors: The program creates a vector without specifying its size and then uses the push_back() function to add elements. This can lead to multiple reallocations of the vector and increase the memory usage. We can use the reserve() function to allocate the required space for the vector beforehand.
5. Use unordered_set instead of unordered_map: The program uses an unordered_map to store the distances of elements from the starting point. However, we only need to store the elements and not their distances. We can use an unordered_set instead, which will reduce the memory usage.
6. Use vector instead of queue: The program uses a queue to perform BFS. However, we only need to access the front and back of the queue, so using a vector with two pointers will be more efficient.
7. Avoid unnecessary checks: The program checks if the size of the result vector is equal to m before breaking the loop. However, we can break the loop as soon as the result vector reaches size m without the need for an additional check.
8. Avoid unnecessary calculations: The program calculates the sum of the distances for each element. However, we can calculate the sum as we add elements to the result vector, eliminating the need for a separate variable.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_set>
#include <algorithm>
#include <random>
#include <chrono>

using namespace std;

void solve() {
    int n, m;
    cin >> n >> m;
    vector<int> v(n);
    for (auto& x : v)
        cin >> x;
    
    unordered_set<int> d;
    vector<int> q;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        d.insert(v[i]);
        q.push_back(v[i]);
    }
    
    vector<int> res;
    int mini_sum = 0;
    while (res.size() < m && !q.empty()) {
        int cur = q.back();
        q.pop_back();
        if (d.count(cur) && cur != 0) {
            res.push_back(cur);
            mini_sum += cur - 1;
            d.insert(cur - 1);
            d.insert(cur + 1);
        }
    }
    
    shuffle(res.begin(), res.end(), default_random_engine(chrono::system_clock::now().time_since_epoch().count()));
    
    cout << mini_sum << "\n";
    for (auto x : res)
        cout << x << " ";
    cout << "\n";
}

int main() {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false), cin.tie(nullptr), cout.tie(nullptr);
    int t = 1;
    while (t--) {
        solve();
    }
    return 0;
}
```
