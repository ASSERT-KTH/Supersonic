The given program calculates the value of a mathematical expression and prints the result. To optimize the program for running time and memory usage, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary header files: The program includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header file, which includes a lot of unnecessary standard library headers. We can remove this line and include only the necessary headers.

2. Remove unused macros: The program defines several macros (`ll`, `MOD`, `M`, `fastIO`, `w(t)`) that are not used. We can remove these macros to simplify the code.

3. Remove unnecessary global variables: The program declares global arrays `dx[]` and `dy[]`, which are not used. We can remove these arrays to reduce memory usage.

4. Use a more efficient sorting algorithm: The program uses the `sort()` function to sort an array. We can use the `std::sort()` function instead to improve the sorting performance.

5. Use a more efficient exponentiation algorithm: The program uses a basic exponentiation algorithm in the `power()` function. We can use the binary exponentiation algorithm (`x^y = (x^(y/2))^2` for even `y` and `x^y = x * (x^((y-1)/2))^2` for odd `y`) to calculate the power more efficiently.

6. Use a more efficient combination calculation algorithm: The program uses a basic combination calculation algorithm in the nested loop. We can optimize this algorithm by using the Pascal's triangle property (`C(n, r) = C(n-1, r) + C(n-1, r-1)`) to calculate combinations more efficiently.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>
#define MOD 1000000007
#define M 1001

typedef long long ll;

ll pows[M];
ll c[M][M];

ll power(ll x, ll y) {
  ll res = 1;
  x = x % MOD;
  if (x == 0) {
    return 0;
  }
  while (y > 0) {
    if (y % 2 == 1) {
      res = (res * x) % MOD;
    }
    y /= 2;
    x = (x * x) % MOD;
  }
  return res;
}

int main() {
  std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  std::cin.tie(NULL);

  pows[0] = 1;
  pows[1] = 1;
  for (ll i = 2; i <= 1000; i++) {
    pows[i] = (pows[i - 1] * 2) % MOD;
  }

  c[0][0] = 1;
  for (int i = 1; i <= 1000; i++) {
    c[i][0] = 1;
    for (int j = 1; j <= i; j++) {
      c[i][j] = (c[i - 1][j] + c[i - 1][j - 1]) % MOD;
    }
  }

  ll n, m;
  std::cin >> n >> m;
  ll a[M];
  for (ll i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    std::cin >> a[i];
  }
  std::sort(a + 1, a + m + 1);

  ll sum = 1;
  ll d = n - m;
  for (int i = 1; i <= m; i++) {
    sum = (sum * c[d][a[i] - a[i - 1] - 1]) % MOD;
    d -= a[i] - a[i - 1] - 1;
  }
  for (int i = 2; i <= m; i++) {
    sum = (sum * pows[a[i] - a[i - 1] - 1]) % MOD;
  }

  std::cout << sum << "\n";

  return 0;
}
```

By making these optimizations, the program should run faster and use less memory compared to the original version.
