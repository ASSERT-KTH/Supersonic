The given program is a C++ program that calculates the optimal values for a certain problem. 

To optimize the program for running time and memory usage, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary headers: The program includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header, which includes a large number of standard library headers. This can increase the compilation time and memory usage. We can replace it with the specific headers that are required for the program.

2. Remove unused typedefs: The program defines several typedefs that are not used in the code. We can remove these typedefs to reduce the memory usage.

3. Remove unnecessary global variables: The program defines several global variables that are only used within specific functions. We can move these variables to their respective functions to reduce the memory usage.

4. Optimize the `getChar()` function: The `getChar()` function reads a character from the input stream using `fread()`. Instead of reading characters one by one, we can read a block of characters into a buffer and then retrieve characters from the buffer when needed. This reduces the number of I/O operations and improves the performance.

5. Optimize the `putChar()` function: Similar to the `getChar()` function, the `putChar()` function writes characters to the output stream using `fwrite()`. We can write characters to a buffer and then flush the buffer when it is full or when the program finishes. This reduces the number of I/O operations and improves the performance.

6. Optimize the `printInt()` function: The `printInt()` function converts an integer to a string and then writes the string characters to the output stream. Instead of converting the integer to a string, we can write the individual digits of the integer to the output stream directly. This eliminates the need for string conversion and improves the performance.

7. Optimize the `CALC()` function: The `CALC()` function calculates the maximum depth and size of each node in a tree using recursive calls. We can optimize this function by using memoization to store the calculated values for each node. This eliminates redundant calculations and improves the performance.

8. Optimize the `find_centroid()` function: The `find_centroid()` function finds the centroid of a tree. We can optimize this function by calculating the size of each subtree only once and storing the maximum subtree size in each node. This eliminates redundant size calculations and improves the performance.

9. Optimize the `KROLIK()` function: The `KROLIK()` function separates the nodes of the tree into two vectors based on whether they are "good" or not. We can optimize this function by using a single vector and keeping track of the indices where the "good" nodes end. This reduces the memory usage and improves the performance.

10. Optimize the `RIP_PAPA()` function: The `RIP_PAPA()` function removes a parent-child connection from the tree. We can optimize this function by using an iterator to find the parent-child connection and erasing it directly. This eliminates the need for a loop and improves the performance.

11. Optimize the `rnm()` function: The `rnm()` function assigns unique IDs to each node in the tree. We can optimize this function by using a breadth-first search algorithm instead of a deque to assign the IDs. This eliminates the need for a deque and improves the performance.

12. Optimize the `rnm2()` function: The `rnm2()` function assigns unique IDs to each node in the tree, excluding the "good" nodes. We can optimize this function by using a breadth-first search algorithm instead of a deque to assign the IDs. This eliminates the need for a deque and improves the performance.

13. Optimize the `GA()` function: The `GA()` function calculates the number of nodes in the tree that can be covered by a certain length. We can optimize this function by using a dynamic programming approach to calculate the number of nodes that can be covered by each length. This eliminates redundant calculations and improves the performance.

14. Optimize the main function: The main function can be optimized by removing unnecessary memory initialization and replacing the `printInt()` function with a more optimized version.
