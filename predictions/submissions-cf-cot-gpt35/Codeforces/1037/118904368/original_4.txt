Step 1: Avoid using namespace std

Using the line "using namespace std;" brings all the names from the std namespace into the global namespace, which can lead to naming conflicts. It is generally considered a bad practice in C++. We can remove this line and use the std:: prefix for the required names.

Step 2: Optimize input and output operations

The current program uses the standard input/output streams (cin, cout) which are slower compared to their counterparts - scanf and printf. We can modify the program to use scanf and printf for faster input and output operations.

Step 3: Avoid unnecessary variable declarations and calculations

The program declares and initializes variables i and j with the same value (mid). This is unnecessary as they will always have the same value throughout the program. We can remove the j variable and use i instead.

Step 4: Optimize the sorting algorithm

The program uses the sort function from the algorithm library to sort the array 'a'. The sort function has an average time complexity of O(n*log(n)). However, since we only need to find the middle element, we can use a partial sort algorithm with a time complexity of O(n) instead.

Step 5: Optimize the while loops

The current while loops in the program can be optimized by removing the comparison check inside the loop and using a decrement/increment operator instead of the assignment operator. This will make the loop run slightly faster.

Step 6: Use long long for intermediate calculations

The program uses the int data type for intermediate calculations in the while loops. Since the problem statement mentions the use of long long for the variables 's' and 'a', it is better to use long long for intermediate calculations as well to avoid overflow.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <cstdio>
#include <algorithm>

int main() {
    int n;
    long long s;
    scanf("%d %lld", &n, &s);
    long long a[n];
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
        scanf("%lld", &a[i]);

    std::partial_sort(a, a + n, a + n);

    int mid = n / 2;
    int i = mid;
    long long l = 0, r = 0;

    while (i >= 0) {
        l += a[i] > s ? a[i] - s : 0;
        i--;
    }

    i = mid;

    while (i < n) {
        r += a[i] < s ? s - a[i] : 0;
        i++;
    }

    printf("%lld", std::max(l, r));
    return 0;
}
```
