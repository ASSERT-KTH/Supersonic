To optimize the given program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Instead of using the `sort` function to sort the array `a`, we can use a simple linear search technique to find the mid-point element. This will reduce the time complexity from O(n log n) to O(n).

2. We can remove the unnecessary variables `l` and `r` and calculate the total difference directly while traversing the array.

3. We can use a single loop to traverse the array from both ends simultaneously, rather than using two separate `while` loops.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int n;
  long long s;
  cin >> n >> s;

  long long a[n];
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    cin >> a[i];

  int mid = 0;
  long long diff = 0;
  for (int i = 0, j = n - 1; i <= j;) {
    if (a[i] > s) {
      diff += a[i] - s;
      i++;
    } else if (a[j] < s) {
      diff += s - a[j];
      j--;
    } else {
      break;
    }
  }

  cout << diff;
  return 0;
}
```

By making these optimizations, we have reduced the time complexity from O(n log n) to O(n) and simplified the code by removing unnecessary variables.
