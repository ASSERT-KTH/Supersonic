To optimize the given program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The program includes the `<algorithm>` header, but it only uses the `sort` function from it. We can remove the `<algorithm>` include and directly include the `<iostream>` header.

2. Remove unnecessary `using namespace std`: This line is not needed since we can use the `std::` prefix to access the standard library functions.

3. Use `std::vector` instead of a raw array: Instead of using a raw array `a[n]`, we can use a `std::vector<long long>` to dynamically allocate memory for the array. This allows us to handle variable `n` without worrying about the size limit.

4. Use a single loop instead of two separate loops: Instead of using two separate loops to calculate `l` and `r`, we can combine them into a single loop. This reduces the number of iterations and improves the overall efficiency of the program.

5. Use prefix increment/decrement operators: Instead of using postfix increment/decrement operators (`i++`, `j--`), we can use prefix increment/decrement operators (`++i`, `--j`). This eliminates the need to create temporary variables and improves the efficiency of the loop.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

int main() {
  int n;
  long long s;
  std::cin >> n >> s;

  std::vector<long long> a(n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
    std::cin >> a[i];

  std::sort(a.begin(), a.end());

  int mid = n / 2;
  int i = mid, j = mid;
  long long l = 0, r = 0;

  while (i >= 0 && j < n) {
    if (a[i] > s) {
      l += a[i] - s;
      --i;
    }
    if (a[j] < s) {
      r += s - a[j];
      ++j;
    }
    if (a[i] <= s && a[j] >= s)
      break;
  }

  std::cout << std::max(l, r);

  return 0;
}
```

By making these optimizations, we have improved the efficiency of the program without changing its functionality.
