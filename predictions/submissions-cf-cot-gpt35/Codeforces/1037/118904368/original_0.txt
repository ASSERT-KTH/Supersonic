Step 1: Remove unnecessary includes

The program includes the `<algorithm>` and `<iostream>` headers, but only uses the `sort` and `cin`/`cout` functions. Therefore, we can remove the `<algorithm>` include.

Step 2: Optimize input/output

The program uses `cin` and `cout` for input and output respectively. These functions can be slow for large inputs/outputs. We can optimize the input/output by using `scanf` and `printf` functions instead.

Step 3: Avoid unnecessary array allocation

The program declares an array `a` of size `n`, but only uses it for input and sorting. We can avoid the array allocation by directly using the input values and sorting them.

Step 4: Simplify the calculation of `l` and `r`

The program uses two separate while loops to calculate `l` and `r`, which can be simplified into a single loop.

Here is the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <cstdio>
#include <algorithm>

int main() {
  int n;
  long long s;
  scanf("%d %lld", &n, &s);
  
  long long l = 0, r = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    long long a;
    scanf("%lld", &a);
    if (a > s) {
      l += a - s;
    } else {
      r += s - a;
    }
  }
  
  printf("%lld", std::max(l, r));
  return 0;
}
```
