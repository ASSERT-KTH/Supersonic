Step 1: Avoid using unnecessary headers
The program includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header, which includes a lot of unnecessary headers. We can remove this and include only the necessary headers for the program, such as `<iostream>` and `<string>`.

Step 2: Avoid using global namespace
The program currently uses the `using namespace std;` statement, which imports all the names from the `std` namespace into the global namespace. This can lead to naming conflicts and increase the compilation time. We can remove this statement and use the `std::` prefix for the standard library names.

Step 3: Optimize string input
The program reads the input string `s` using the `cin` object. By default, the `cin` object is synchronized with the C standard library's input/output functions, which can slow down the input process. We can improve the input speed by disabling the synchronization between the C and C++ standard libraries using `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false)`.

Step 4: Use a more efficient data structure for `pp`
The program uses a 2D array `pp` to store the number of mismatches for each substring and each pattern. However, the size of this array is fixed to `6 x (n + 1)`, which can be quite large for large values of `n`. We can optimize the memory usage by using a 1D array of size `6` and a temporary variable to store the previous value of `pp`.

Step 5: Optimize the inner loop
The inner loop in the program updates the `pp` array by checking if the character at position `j` in the input string matches the pattern. We can optimize this loop by using the modulo operator to access the correct character in the pattern string.

Step 6: Optimize the minimum calculation
The program calculates the minimum `ans` for each query by iterating over all the patterns and comparing the current `ans` with the mismatch count for each pattern. We can optimize this calculation by using the `std::min` function and passing the pattern mismatch count directly.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#define ll long long

int main() {
  std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  std::cin.tie(NULL);

  int n, m;
  std::cin >> n >> m;
  
  std::string s;
  std::cin >> s;
  
  std::string k[6] = {"abc", "acb", "bac", "bca", "cab", "cba"};
  int pp[6] = {0};
  
  for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
    for (int i = 0; i < 6; i++) {
      pp[i] += (k[i][j % 3] != s[j]);
    }
  }
  
  while (m--) {
    int l, r;
    std::cin >> l >> r;
    l--;
    int ans = r - l;
    
    for (int i = 0; i < 6; i++) {
      ans = std::min(ans, pp[i]);
    }
    
    std::cout << ans << std::endl;
  }
  
  return 0;
}
```

The optimized program makes the following modifications to the original program:
- Removes unnecessary headers and includes only the necessary ones.
- Removes the `using namespace std;` statement.
- Adds `std::` prefix to the standard library names.
- Disables synchronization between the C and C++ standard libraries.
- Uses a 1D array and a temporary variable to optimize memory usage for `pp`.
- Optimizes the inner loop by using the modulo operator.
- Optimizes the minimum calculation by using the `std::min` function.
