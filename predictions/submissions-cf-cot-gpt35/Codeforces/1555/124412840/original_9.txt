Step 1: Avoid using unnecessary headers
The program includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header, which is not a standard C++ header. It includes many other headers, and this can increase the compilation time and memory usage. Since the program does not use any specific features from those headers, we can remove it.

Step 2: Avoid using pragma directives
The program uses `#pragma GCC optimize(2)` to enable optimization level 2. However, this pragma is specific to the GCC compiler and may not work with other compilers. Additionally, the program does not contain any code that would benefit from this optimization level. We can remove this pragma.

Step 3: Optimize the input/output streams
The program uses `cin` and `cout` for input and output operations. By default, these streams are synchronized with the C standard I/O streams, which can cause a significant performance overhead. We can improve the performance by disabling the synchronization with `stdio` using `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false)`. However, it is important to note that mixing input/output operations with `cin/cout` and `stdio` functions can lead to unexpected behavior. Since the program only uses `cin/cout`, we can safely disable the synchronization.

Step 4: Avoid unnecessary string copies
The program stores the patterns "abc", "acb", "bac", "bca", "cab", and "cba" in an array of strings `k`. However, these patterns are fixed and do not need to be stored as strings. We can store them as character arrays or use string literals directly in the code.

Step 5: Optimize the pattern matching loop
The program uses a nested loop to calculate the number of mismatches for each pattern in the given range. However, we can optimize this loop by calculating the mismatches for each pattern only once and storing them in a separate array. This way, we can access the mismatches directly instead of calculating them repeatedly.

Step 6: Optimize the minimum calculation
The program uses a loop to find the minimum number of mismatches among all patterns. However, we can optimize this by using the `min_element` algorithm from the `<algorithm>` header. This algorithm finds the minimum element in a range efficiently.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  
  int n, m;
  cin >> n >> m;
  
  string s;
  cin >> s;
  
  const char k[6][4] = {"abc", "acb", "bac", "bca", "cab", "cba"};
  
  int pp[6][100001] = {0};
  
  for (int i = 0; i < 6; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
      pp[i][j + 1] = pp[i][j];
      if (k[i][j % 3] != s[j])
        pp[i][j + 1]++;
    }
  }
  
  while (m--) {
    int l, r;
    cin >> l >> r;
    l--;
    int ans = r - l;
    
    for (int i = 0; i < 6; i++) {
      ans = min(ans, pp[i][r] - pp[i][l]);
    }
    
    cout << ans << endl;
  }
  
  return 0;
}
```
