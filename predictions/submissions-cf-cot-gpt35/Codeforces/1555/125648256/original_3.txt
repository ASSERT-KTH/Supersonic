The given program calculates the minimum of the maximum of two sums, one from the beginning and one from the end, for each column in a matrix. The goal is to optimize the program for running time and memory usage.

To optimize the program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary header files: The program includes both `<bits/stdc++.h>` and `<iostream>`. We only need `<iostream>` for input and output operations, so we can remove `<bits/stdc++.h>`.

2. Remove the `using namespace std;` line: It is generally considered a good practice to avoid using the entire `std` namespace to prevent name conflicts. Instead, we can use the `std::` prefix for standard library functions and types.

3. Remove the unused `ll` typedef: The `ll` typedef is not used in the program, so we can remove it.

4. Use pass-by-reference for the `solve` function: Currently, the `solve` function is called by value, which means it creates a copy of the function argument. This can be avoided by using pass-by-reference, which can improve performance.

5. Use `reserve` function for vector: The `matrix` vector is resized to hold `m` elements for each row. We can use the `reserve` function to allocate memory for `m` elements in each row in advance, which can avoid unnecessary reallocations and improve performance.

6. Use prefix increment instead of postfix increment: In the `for` loops, the loop counter is incremented using the postfix increment operator (`j++`). Using the prefix increment operator (`++j`) can be more efficient as it avoids the creation of a temporary variable.

7. Avoid repeated calculations: The program calculates the sum of elements in the first row of the matrix multiple times. We can calculate it once and store it in a variable to avoid repeated calculations.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

void solve(int&);

int main() {
  int test = 1;
  std::cin >> test;
  while (test--) {
    solve(test);
  }
  return 0;
}

void solve(int& test) {
  int m;
  std::cin >> m;
  
  std::vector<std::vector<int>> matrix(2);
  matrix[0].reserve(m);
  matrix[1].reserve(m);

  for (int i = 0; i < 2; ++i) {
    for (int j = 0; j < m; ++j) {
      int num;
      std::cin >> num;
      matrix[i].push_back(num);
    }
  }
  
  int suffix = 0;
  int prefix = 0;
  
  for (int j = 1; j < m; ++j) {
    suffix += matrix[0][j];
  }
  
  int ans = suffix;
  
  for (int j = 1; j < m; ++j) {
    suffix -= matrix[0][j];
    prefix += matrix[1][j - 1];
    ans = std::min(ans, std::max(prefix, suffix));
  }
  
  std::cout << ans << std::endl;
}
```
