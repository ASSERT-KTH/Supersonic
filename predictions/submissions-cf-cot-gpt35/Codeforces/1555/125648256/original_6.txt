Step 1: Remove unnecessary headers
- The `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` header is not necessary and can be removed.
- The `#include <iostream>` header is already included in `<bits/stdc++.h>` and can be removed.

Step 2: Avoid using `using namespace std`
- It is generally considered a bad practice to use `using namespace std` as it can lead to naming conflicts.
- Instead, we can prefix the standard library types and functions with `std::`.

Step 3: Pass the vector by reference in the `solve()` function
- Currently, the `solve()` function receives the vector by value, which means it makes a copy of the vector.
- We can pass the vector by reference to avoid unnecessary copying.

Step 4: Optimize the calculation of `suffix` and `prefix`
- Instead of calculating the `suffix` and `prefix` values in separate loops, we can combine them into a single loop.
- By doing so, we can calculate the `suffix` and `prefix` values in a cumulative manner, which eliminates the need to iterate over the matrix twice.

Step 5: Use `std::accumulate` to calculate the sum of a vector
- Instead of manually summing the elements of a vector, we can use the `std::accumulate` function from the `<numeric>` header.
- This will make the code more concise and potentially faster.

Step 6: Use `std::min_element` to find the minimum element in a vector
- Instead of manually iterating over a vector to find the minimum element, we can use the `std::min_element` function from the `<algorithm>` header.
- This will make the code more concise and potentially faster.

Step 7: Remove unnecessary `return` statement
- The `solve()` function does not need a `return` statement, as it has a `void` return type.

Here is the optimized C++ program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <numeric>

void solve(std::vector<std::vector<int>>& matrix);

int main() {
  int test = 1;
  std::cin >> test;
  while (test--) {
    solve();
  }
  return 0;
}

void solve(std::vector<std::vector<int>>& matrix) {
  int m;
  std::cin >> m;
  matrix.resize(2, std::vector<int>(m));
  for (int i = 0; i < 2; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j < m; j++) {
      std::cin >> matrix[i][j];
    }
  }
  int suffix = std::accumulate(matrix[0].begin() + 1, matrix[0].end(), 0);
  int prefix = 0;
  int ans = suffix;
  for (int j = 1; j < m; j++) {
    suffix -= matrix[0][j];
    prefix += matrix[1][j - 1];
    ans = std::min(ans, std::max(prefix, suffix));
  }
  std::cout << ans << std::endl;
}
```
