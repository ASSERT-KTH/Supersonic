Step 1: Remove unnecessary includes
- The `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` is unnecessary as it includes a large number of headers which may not be needed.
- The `#include <iostream>` is also unnecessary as it is already included in the `bits/stdc++.h` header.

Step 2: Remove unnecessary namespace declaration
- The `using namespace std;` statement is unnecessary as it pollutes the global namespace.

Step 3: Avoid unnecessary vector initialization
- The `matrix` vector is initialized with default values, but it is not necessary as all the elements will be overwritten in the following loop.

Step 4: Avoid unnecessary vector resizing
- The `matrix` vector is resized to 2 rows by `m` columns, but it is not necessary as the size is already specified in the loop.

Step 5: Remove unnecessary return statement
- The `return;` statement at the end of the `solve()` function is unnecessary as the function has a void return type.

Step 6: Optimize the calculation of `ans`
- The calculation of `ans` can be optimized by calculating the suffix and prefix sums simultaneously in the same loop.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

#define ll long long int

void solve();

int main() {
  int test;
  cin >> test;
  while (test--) {
    solve();
  }
  return 0;
}

void solve() {
  int m;
  cin >> m;
  
  vector<int> row1(m);
  vector<int> row2(m);

  for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
    cin >> row1[i];
  }
  for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
    cin >> row2[i];
  }

  ll suffix = 0;
  ll prefix = 0;
  ll ans = 0;

  for (int j = 1; j < m; j++) {
    suffix += row1[j];
    ans = min(ans, max(prefix, suffix));
    prefix += row2[j - 1];
  }

  cout << ans << endl;
}
```
