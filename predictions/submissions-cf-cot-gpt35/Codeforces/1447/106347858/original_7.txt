To optimize the given program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The program includes `<bits/stdc++.h>` which includes all standard library headers. This can increase the compilation time and potentially increase memory usage. We can remove this line and include only the necessary headers.

2. Remove unnecessary macros: The program defines macros for `int`, `rep`, `mod`, and `inf` but doesn't use them. We can remove these macros as they are not needed.

3. Remove unnecessary function: The program defines a `pow` function but it is not used. We can remove this function to simplify the code.

4. Optimize input/output: The program uses `cin` and `cout` for input and output. However, these can be slower compared to other input/output methods like `scanf` and `printf`. We can modify the code to use `scanf` and `printf` instead.

5. Optimize loop variables: The program uses `int` type for loop variables `i` and `j`. Since the loop bounds are within the range of `int`, we can change the loop variables to `int` instead of `long long` to save memory.

Here's the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cstdio>
#include <climits>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    int T;
    scanf("%d", &T);
    while (T--) {
        int n, m;
        scanf("%d %d", &n, &m);
        int ne = 0, ans = 0, mn = INT_MAX, o = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < m; j++) {
                int x;
                scanf("%d", &x);
                if (x < 0)
                    x *= -1, ne++;
                if (x <= 0)
                    o++;
                mn = min(mn, x);
                ans += x;
            }
        }
        if (ne & 1 and (ne + o) & 1)
            printf("%d\n", ans - 2 * mn);
        else
            printf("%d\n", ans);
    }
    return 0;
}
```

By making these optimizations, the program should have improved running time and reduced memory usage.
