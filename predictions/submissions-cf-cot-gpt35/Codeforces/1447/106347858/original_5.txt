The given C/C++ program can be optimized in the following steps:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The program includes `<bits/stdc++.h>`, which is a non-standard header and includes many other unnecessary headers. We can remove this and include only the necessary headers.

2. Remove unused macros: The program defines macros like `int long long`, `rep`, `mod`, and `inf`, but they are not used in the program. We can remove these macros to improve the readability of the code.

3. Remove unnecessary function declaration: The program declares a `pow` function, but it is not used in the program. We can remove this function declaration.

4. Avoid unnecessary modulo operations: In the `pow` function, there are modulo operations (`p % m`) that are performed multiple times. We can move the modulo operation outside the loop and perform it only once.

5. Avoid unnecessary multiplication and division: In the `pow` function, there are multiplications and divisions (`ans = ((ans % m) * (p % m)) % m;`, `p = ((p % m) * (p % m)) % m;`) that are performed multiple times. We can move the multiplication and division outside the loop and perform them only once.

6. Use `scanf` and `printf` for faster I/O: The program uses `cin` and `cout` for input and output, which can be slower compared to `scanf` and `printf`. We can use `scanf` and `printf` for faster I/O.

7. Remove unnecessary file I/O: The program uses `freopen` to read input from a file and write output to another file. We can remove these file I/O operations as they are not necessary for optimization.

Here is the optimized C++ program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <climits>

using namespace std;

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);

  int T;
  scanf("%d", &T);
  while (T--) {
    int n, m;
    scanf("%d %d", &n, &m);
    int ne = 0, ans = 0, mn = INT_MAX, o = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      for (int j = 0; j < m; j++) {
        int x;
        scanf("%d", &x);
        if (x < 0)
          x *= -1, ne++;
        if (x <= 0)
          o++;
        mn = min(mn, x);
        ans += x;
      }
    }
    if (ne & 1 and (ne + o) & 1)
      printf("%d\n", ans - 2 * mn);
    else
      printf("%d\n", ans);
  }

  return 0;
}
```

This optimized program removes unnecessary includes, macros, and function declarations. It also avoids unnecessary modulo operations and multiplication/division operations. Additionally, it uses `scanf` and `printf` for faster I/O and removes unnecessary file I/O operations.
