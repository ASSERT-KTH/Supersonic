Step 1: Remove unnecessary includes

The program includes the entire `<bits/stdc++.h>` library, which is not necessary and can slow down the compilation process. We can remove this line.

Step 2: Remove unnecessary macros

The program defines macros for `int`, `rep`, `mod`, and `inf`, but these are not used in the program. We can remove these lines.

Step 3: Remove unnecessary input/output synchronization

The program includes the `garou99` macro, which is used to synchronize input/output with `cin` and `cout`. However, this is not necessary for this program, so we can remove this macro.

Step 4: Optimize the power function

The power function `pow` is used to calculate the power of a number. However, this function is not used in the program. We can remove this function.

Step 5: Optimize the loop variables

The program uses the loop variables `i` and `j` for iterating over the matrix. However, these variables are not used for any other purpose. We can replace them with a single loop variable `k` and calculate the row and column indices using integer division and modulo operations. This will reduce the overhead of maintaining two loop variables.

Step 6: Optimize the minimum calculation

The program initializes `mn` with `INT_MAX` and then updates it with the minimum value in each iteration. Instead of initializing `mn` with `INT_MAX`, we can initialize it with the maximum possible value of `x` in the matrix. This will avoid unnecessary comparisons and updates in each iteration.

Step 7: Optimize the negative and zero count

The program uses variables `ne` and `o` to count the number of negative and zero elements in the matrix. However, these variables are not used for any other purpose. We can remove these variables and calculate the counts in the same loop where we calculate the sum and minimum.

Step 8: Optimize the output calculation

The program uses an if-else statement to calculate the final output based on the counts of negative and zero elements. Instead of using the if-else statement, we can calculate the final output directly using the counts and the minimum value. This will avoid the overhead of the if-else statement.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <climits>

int main() {
    std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    std::cin.tie(NULL);

    int T;
    std::cin >> T;

    while (T--) {
        int n, m;
        std::cin >> n >> m;

        int mn = INT_MAX;
        int ans = 0;

        for (int k = 0; k < n * m; k++) {
            int x;
            std::cin >> x;
            ans += x;
            mn = std::min(mn, x);
        }

        int ne = n * m - mn;
        int o = n * m - ne;

        if (ne & 1 and o & 1)
            std::cout << ans - 2 * mn;
        else
            std::cout << ans;

        std::cout << '\n';
    }

    return 0;
}
```
