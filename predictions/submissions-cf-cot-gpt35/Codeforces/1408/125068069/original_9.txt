The given program is written in a highly obfuscated and inefficient manner. The following optimizations can be made to improve the running time and memory usage:

1. Remove unnecessary header files: The program includes `<bits/stdc++.h>` and `<cstdio>` which are not required for this program. We can remove them.

2. Remove unused macros: The program defines a number of macros that are not used in the code. We can remove them to simplify the code.

3. Remove unnecessary type definitions: The program defines a number of type definitions (e.g., `typedef`, `using`) that are not used. We can remove them to reduce the complexity of the code.

4. Simplify variable names: The program uses variable names like `v1`, `v2`, `l`, `r`, `p1`, `p2`, `ans` which are not very descriptive. We can use more meaningful names to improve code readability.

5. Use `inline` function instead of a regular function: The function `SHIT_HERE_WE_GO_AGAIN` is defined separately from the `main` function. Since the function is only called once, we can make it an `inline` function to avoid the function call overhead.

6. Avoid unnecessary type conversions: The program uses type casting and conversion in some places which can be avoided to improve performance.

7. Remove unnecessary comments: The program contains comments like `// here we go again` which do not provide any useful information. We can remove such comments to reduce code clutter.

Here is the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

void solve() {
  int n, ln;
  cin >> n >> ln;
  vector<int> flag(n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    cin >> flag[i];
  int velocity1 = 1, velocity2 = 1, left = 0, right = n - 1;
  long double position1 = 0, position2 = static_cast<long double>(ln), answer = 0;
  while (left <= right) {
    if ((flag[left] - position1) / velocity1 < (position2 - flag[right]) / velocity2) {
      long double t = (flag[left] - position1) / velocity1;
      position1 = flag[left];
      velocity1++;
      left++;
      position2 -= velocity2 * t;
      answer += t;
    } else if ((flag[left] - position1) / velocity1 > (position2 - flag[right]) / velocity2) {
      long double t = (position2 - flag[right]) / velocity2;
      position2 = flag[right];
      velocity2++;
      right--;
      position1 += velocity1 * t;
      answer += t;
    } else {
      long double t = (flag[left] - position1) / velocity1;
      position1 = flag[left];
      position2 = flag[right];
      velocity1++;
      velocity2++;
      left++;
      right--;
      answer += t;
    }
  }
  answer += (position2 - position1) / (velocity1 + velocity2);
  printf("%.14Lf\n", answer);
}

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(0);
  int t;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    solve();
  }
}
```

The optimized version of the program simplifies the code, removes unnecessary elements, and improves code readability while retaining the same functionality.
