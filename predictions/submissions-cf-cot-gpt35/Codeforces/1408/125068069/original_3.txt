To optimize the given program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary header files: The program includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header file, which includes a large number of standard library headers. This can result in increased compilation time and memory usage. Since the program does not use any specific functions from these headers, we can remove this line.

2. Remove unnecessary macros: The program defines a large number of macros that are not used in the code. These macros can make the code less readable and harder to maintain. We can remove these macros to simplify the code.

3. Replace `cin` and `cout` with `scanf` and `printf`: The program uses the `cin` and `cout` stream objects for input and output. However, these stream objects can be slower than the `scanf` and `printf` functions, especially when dealing with large input/output. We can replace the `cin` and `cout` statements with `scanf` and `printf` for faster input/output.

4. Simplify the loop logic: The program uses a while loop with multiple conditions and nested if-else statements. This can make the code harder to understand and optimize. We can simplify the loop logic by using a single condition and removing the else statements.

5. Remove unnecessary variables: The program defines several variables that are not used in the code. We can remove these variables to reduce memory usage.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <cstdio>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

void SHIT_HERE_WE_GO_AGAIN() {
  int n, ln;
  scanf("%d %d", &n, &ln);
  vector<int> flag(n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    scanf("%d", &flag[i]);
  int v1 = 1, v2 = 1, l = 0, r = n - 1;
  double p1 = 0, p2 = ln, ans = 0;
  while (l <= r) {
    double t;
    if ((flag[l] - p1) / v1 < (p2 - flag[r]) / v2) {
      t = (flag[l] - p1) / v1;
      p1 = flag[l];
      v1++;
      l++;
      p2 -= v2 * t;
    } else {
      t = (p2 - flag[r]) / v2;
      p2 = flag[r];
      v2++;
      r--;
      p1 += v1 * t;
    }
    ans += t;
  }
  ans += (p2 - p1) / (v1 + v2);
  printf("%.14lf\n", ans);
}

int main() {
  int t;
  scanf("%d", &t);
  while (t--) {
    SHIT_HERE_WE_GO_AGAIN();
  }
}
```

This optimized program removes unnecessary headers and macros, replaces `cin` and `cout` with `scanf` and `printf`, simplifies the loop logic, and removes unnecessary variables. These modifications should improve the running time and memory usage of the program.
