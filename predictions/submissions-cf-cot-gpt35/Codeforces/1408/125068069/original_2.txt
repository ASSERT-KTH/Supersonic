Step 1: Remove unnecessary headers and macros.

The program includes unnecessary headers and macros that are not used. We can remove them to simplify the code.

Step 2: Remove unused typedefs.

The program defines several typedefs that are not used. We can remove them to simplify the code.

Step 3: Remove unnecessary code comments.

The program contains comments that are not necessary for understanding the code. We can remove them to simplify the code.

Step 4: Optimize input/output operations.

The program uses `cin` and `cout` for input and output operations, which can be slower compared to other methods such as using `scanf` and `printf`. We can modify the code to use `scanf` and `printf` for better performance.

Step 5: Optimize the calculation of `ans`.

The program calculates `ans` using floating-point arithmetic, which can be slower compared to using integer arithmetic. We can modify the code to use integer arithmetic instead.

Step 6: Remove unnecessary variables.

The program defines several variables that are not used. We can remove them to simplify the code.

Here is the optimized code:

```c++
#include <cstdio>

void SHIT_HERE_WE_GO_AGAIN() {
    int n, ln;
    scanf("%d %d", &n, &ln);
    int flag[n];
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
        scanf("%d", &flag[i]);
    int v1 = 1, v2 = 1, l = 0, r = n - 1;
    long long p1 = 0, p2 = ln, ans = 0;
    while (l <= r) {
        if ((flag[l] - p1) * v2 < (p2 - flag[r]) * v1) {
            long long t = (flag[l] - p1) * v2;
            p1 = flag[l];
            v1++;
            l++;
            p2 -= t;
            ans += t / v2;
        } else if ((flag[l] - p1) * v2 > (p2 - flag[r]) * v1) {
            long long t = (p2 - flag[r]) * v1;
            p2 = flag[r];
            v2++;
            r--;
            p1 += t;
            ans += t / v1;
        } else {
            long long t = (flag[l] - p1) * v1;
            p1 = flag[l];
            p2 = flag[r];
            v1++;
            v2++;
            l++;
            r--;
            ans += t / (v1 + v2);
        }
    }
    ans += (p2 - p1) / (v1 + v2);
    printf("%lld\n", ans);
}

int main() {
    int t;
    scanf("%d", &t);
    while (t--) {
        SHIT_HERE_WE_GO_AGAIN();
    }
    return 0;
}
```

In the optimized code, unnecessary headers, typedefs, and macros have been removed. The input/output operations have been modified to use `scanf` and `printf` for better performance. The calculation of `ans` has been optimized to use integer arithmetic instead of floating-point arithmetic.
