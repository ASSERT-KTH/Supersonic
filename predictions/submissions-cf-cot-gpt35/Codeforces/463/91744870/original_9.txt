Step 1: Remove unnecessary header files

The program includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header file, which is not a standard C++ header file and includes a large number of other header files. Since the program does not use any specific features from these header files, we can remove this line and include only the necessary header files.

Step 2: Remove unnecessary typedefs

The program defines several typedefs for commonly used types such as `ll`, `ull`, `pii`, `pll`, `vi`, `vb`. However, these typedefs are not used in the program, so we can remove them.

Step 3: Remove unnecessary macros

The program defines several macros such as `mp`, `pb`, `eb`, `sq`, `fo`, `fp`, `Fo`, `all`, `allr`, `deb`, `deb2`, `fi`, `se`, `uni`, `fast`. However, these macros are not used in the program, so we can remove them.

Step 4: Remove unused code

The program defines a `cp()` function and uses it to redirect standard input and output to files in the local directory. However, this function is not used in the program, so we can remove it.

Step 5: Optimize memory allocation

The program declares a 2D array `a[n][n]` to store the input values. However, since the size of the array is not known at compile time, this is not valid C++ code. We can use a `vector<vector<ll>>` instead to dynamically allocate memory for the array.

Step 6: Optimize map usage

The program uses two `map` objects, `cnt` and `cnt1`, to store the sum of values for each row-column and row-difference combination respectively. However, since the maximum size of these maps is known (n+n-1), we can use an array instead to store the sums, which will be more efficient.

Step 7: Optimize loop variables

The program uses nested loops to iterate over each element of the 2D array `a`. However, the loop variables `i` and `j` are not modified within the loop. We can optimize this by using a range-based for loop instead.

Step 8: Optimize output

The program uses a range-based for loop to output the values of `ans`. However, since `ans` is an array of pairs, we can use a regular for loop with an index variable to output the values more efficiently.

Here is the optimized C++ program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <map>
using namespace std;

void solve() {
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  vector<vector<long long>> a(n, vector<long long>(n));
  vector<long long> sum(2, -1);
  vector<pair<long long, long long>> ans(2);
  vector<long long> cnt(n + n - 1), cnt1(n + n - 1);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
      cin >> a[i][j];
      cnt[i + j] += a[i][j];
      cnt1[i - j + n - 1] += a[i][j];
    }
  }
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
      int c = (i + j) % 2;
      long long val = cnt[i + j] + cnt1[i - j + n - 1] - a[i][j];
      if (val > sum[c]) {
        sum[c] = val;
        ans[c] = make_pair(i, j);
      }
    }
  }
  cout << sum[0] + sum[1] << "\n";
  for (int i = 0; i < 2; i++) {
    cout << ans[i].first + 1 << " " << ans[i].second + 1 << " ";
  }
}

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(nullptr);
  solve();
  return 0;
}
```
