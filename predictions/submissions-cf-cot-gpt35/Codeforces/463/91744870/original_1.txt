To optimize the given C/C++ program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The program includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header, which includes all standard library headers. This can significantly increase the compilation time and memory usage. We can remove this line and include only the necessary headers.

2. Remove unnecessary type definitions: The program defines several type aliases (`ll`, `ull`, `pii`, `pll`, `vi`, `vb`) which are not used in the code. We can remove these type definitions to reduce the memory usage.

3. Remove unnecessary macros: The program defines several macros (`mp`, `pb`, `eb`, `sq`, `fo`, `fp`, `Fo`, `all`, `allr`, `deb`, `deb2`, `fi`, `se`, `uni`, `fast`) which are not used in the code. We can remove these macros to reduce the memory usage.

4. Use `vector<vector<ll>>` instead of `ll a[n][n]`: The program declares a 2D array `a` using variable-length arrays, which are not supported by standard C++. We can replace this with a vector of vectors (`vector<vector<ll>>`) to ensure portability and avoid potential stack overflow.

5. Use `emplace_back` instead of `push_back`: The program uses `push_back` to add elements to vectors. However, `emplace_back` is more efficient as it constructs the element in place without unnecessary copies or moves.

6. Use range-based for loop: The program uses nested for loops (`fo(i, n) fo(j, n)`) to iterate over the elements of the 2D array. We can use a range-based for loop to simplify the code and improve readability.

7. Use unordered_map instead of map: The program uses a `map` to store the counts of elements. However, an `unordered_map` can provide faster lookup and insertion, especially when the number of elements is large.

After applying these optimizations, the optimized C++ program is:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>

using namespace std;

void solve() {
  long long n;
  cin >> n;
  vector<vector<long long>> a(n, vector<long long>(n));
  vector<long long> sum(2, -1);
  vector<pair<long long, long long>> ans(2);
  unordered_map<long long, long long> cnt, cnt1;

  for (auto& row : a) {
    for (auto& elem : row) {
      cin >> elem;
    }
  }

  for (long long i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    for (long long j = 0; j < n; j++) {
      cnt[i + j] += a[i][j];
      cnt1[i - j] += a[i][j];
    }
  }

  for (long long i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    for (long long j = 0; j < n; j++) {
      long long val = cnt[i + j] + cnt1[i - j] - a[i][j];
      long long c = (i + j) % 2;
      if (val > sum[c]) {
        sum[c] = val;
        ans[c] = make_pair(i, j);
      }
    }
  }

  cout << sum[0] + sum[1] << "\n";
  for (auto it : ans) {
    cout << it.first + 1 << " " << it.second + 1 << " ";
  }
}

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);

  long long t = 1;
  while (t--) {
    solve();
  }

  return 0;
}
```

These optimizations should improve the running time and reduce the memory usage of the program.
