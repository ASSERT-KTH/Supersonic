The given program is a C++ program that solves a specific problem. To optimize the program for running time and memory usage, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary headers: The program includes `<bits/stdc++.h>`, which includes a lot of unnecessary headers. We can remove this line and include only the necessary headers.

2. Remove unnecessary type definitions: The program defines several type aliases (`ll`, `ull`, `pii`, `pll`, `vi`, `vb`) that are not used in the program. We can remove these type definitions.

3. Remove unnecessary macros: The program defines several macros (`mp`, `pb`, `eb`, `sq`, `fo`, `fp`, `Fo`, `all`, `allr`, `deb`, `deb2`, `fi`, `se`, `uni`, `fast`) that are not used in the program. We can remove these macros.

4. Remove unnecessary code in the `cp` function: The `cp` function defines a macro to redirect the input and output streams to files. Since it is not used in the program, we can remove this function.

5. Use `vector<vector<ll>>` instead of `ll a[n][n]`: The program declares a 2D array `ll a[n][n]` to store the input values. Using a dynamically allocated 2D vector (`vector<vector<ll>>`) instead of an array can improve memory usage and avoid potential stack overflow.

6. Use `unordered_map` instead of `map`: The program uses a `map` to store the sums of elements based on their indices. Since unordered access is sufficient and the order of elements doesn't matter, we can use an `unordered_map` instead of a `map` for better performance.

7. Avoid unnecessary calculations in the `update` function: The `update` function calculates the sum of elements based on their indices and updates the maximum sum and corresponding indices. However, the sum calculation is unnecessary as it is already calculated in the `solve` function. We can modify the `update` function to only update the maximum sum and corresponding indices.

8. Use range-based `for` loop instead of traditional `for` loop: The program uses traditional `for` loops (`fo`, `fp`, `Fo`) to iterate over elements. We can use range-based `for` loops for cleaner and more readable code.

9. Use a single loop to output the answer: The program uses two separate loops to output the answer. We can combine these loops into a single loop for better efficiency.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>

using namespace std;

void solve() {
  int n;
  cin >> n;

  vector<vector<long long>> a(n, vector<long long>(n));
  vector<long long> sum(2, -1);
  vector<pair<int, int>> ans(2);

  unordered_map<long long, long long> cnt, cnt1;

  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
      cin >> a[i][j];
      cnt[i + j] += a[i][j];
      cnt1[i - j] += a[i][j];
    }
  }

  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
      int c = (i + j) % 2;
      long long val = cnt[i + j] + cnt1[i - j] - a[i][j];
      if (val > sum[c]) {
        sum[c] = val;
        ans[c] = make_pair(i, j);
      }
    }
  }

  cout << sum[0] + sum[1] << "\n";
  for (auto it : ans) {
    cout << it.first + 1 << " " << it.second + 1 << " ";
  }
}

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);

  solve();

  return 0;
}
```

This optimized program retains the functionality of the original program but improves its efficiency by reducing unnecessary code and using more efficient data structures and loops.
