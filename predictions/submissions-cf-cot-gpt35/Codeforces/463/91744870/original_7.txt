Step 1: Remove unnecessary includes
- The program includes `<bits/stdc++.h>` which is not necessary and can be removed.

Step 2: Remove unnecessary typedefs
- The program includes typedefs for `ll`, `ull`, `pii`, `pll`, `vi`, and `vb` which are not used in the program and can be removed.

Step 3: Remove unnecessary macros
- The program includes macros for `mp`, `pb`, `eb`, `sq`, `fo`, `fp`, `Fo`, `all`, `allr`, `deb`, `deb2`, `fi`, `se`, `uni`, and `fast` which are not used in the program and can be removed.

Step 4: Remove unused code
- The `cp` function and the `freopen` calls are not used in the program and can be removed.

Step 5: Optimize the input and output operations
- The program uses `cin` and `cout` for input and output, which can be slower than using `scanf` and `printf`. By replacing `cin` with `scanf` and `cout` with `printf`, we can improve the performance of the program.

Step 6: Optimize the loop variables
- The program uses `i` and `j` as loop variables, which are of type `int`. Since the loop variables are used as indices for the array `a`, they can be declared as `size_t` to improve performance.

Step 7: Optimize the array initialization
- The program initializes the arrays `ans` and `sum` with default values. Since these arrays are later overwritten, the initialization can be removed to save memory usage.

Step 8: Optimize the map usage
- The program uses `map` to store the sums for each row and column. However, since the values of `i + j` and `i - j` are within a specific range, we can use arrays instead of maps to store the sums. This will improve the performance of accessing the sums.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cstdio>
#include <map>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

void solve() {
  size_t n;
  scanf("%zu", &n);
  long long a[n][n];
  long long sum[2] = {-1, -1};
  pair<size_t, size_t> ans[2];
  vector<long long> cnt(n + n), cnt1(n + n);
  for (size_t i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    for (size_t j = 0; j < n; j++) {
      scanf("%lld", &a[i][j]);
      cnt[i + j] += a[i][j];
      cnt1[i - j + n] += a[i][j];
    }
  }
  for (size_t i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    for (size_t j = 0; j < n; j++) {
      long long val = cnt[i + j] + cnt1[i - j + n] - a[i][j];
      if (val > sum[(i + j) % 2]) {
        sum[(i + j) % 2] = val;
        ans[(i + j) % 2] = make_pair(i, j);
      }
    }
  }
  printf("%lld\n", sum[0] + sum[1]);
  for (auto it : ans) {
    printf("%zu %zu ", it.first + 1, it.second + 1);
  }
}

int main() {
  size_t t = 1;
  while (t--)
    solve();
  return 0;
}
```
