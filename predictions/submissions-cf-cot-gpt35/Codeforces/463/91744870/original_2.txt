Step 1: Remove unnecessary includes and typedefs

The program includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header, which is not a standard C++ header and may include unnecessary headers. We can remove this line and include only the necessary headers. Additionally, there are some typedefs that are not used in the program, so we can remove them as well.

Step 2: Replace macros with inline functions

The program uses several macros for common operations like squaring a number and printing debug information. We can replace these macros with inline functions for better type safety and easier debugging.

Step 3: Optimize input and output operations

The program uses `cin` and `cout` for input and output operations. These operations can be slow when dealing with large inputs or outputs. We can optimize them by using `scanf` and `printf` instead.

Step 4: Optimize loops

The program uses nested loops to iterate over a 2D array. We can optimize these loops by using a single loop and calculating the indices using a formula.

Step 5: Avoid unnecessary calculations

The program calculates the sum of elements in two maps, `cnt` and `cnt1`, for each element of the 2D array. We can optimize this by calculating these sums only once outside the loop.

Step 6: Optimize memory usage

The program uses a 2D array of size `n x n`, where `n` can be large. This can consume a lot of memory. We can optimize the memory usage by using a 1D array and calculating the indices using a formula.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <map>
using namespace std;

inline int sq(int x) {
  return x * x;
}

void cp() {
#ifndef ONLINE_JUDGE
  freopen("input.txt", "r", stdin);
  freopen("output.txt", "w", stdout);
#endif
}

pair<int, int> update(int c, int i, int j, int val) {
  static vector<pair<int, int>> ans(2);
  static vector<int> sum(2, -1);
  if (val > sum[c]) {
    sum[c] = val;
    ans[c].first = i;
    ans[c].second = j;
  }
  return ans[c];
}

void solve() {
  int n;
  scanf("%d", &n);
  vector<int> a(n * n);
  vector<int> cnt(n + n, 0), cnt1(n + n, 0);
  for (int i = 0; i < n * n; i++) {
    scanf("%d", &a[i]);
    int row = i / n;
    int col = i % n;
    cnt[row + col] += a[i];
    cnt1[row - col + n] += a[i];
  }
  pair<int, int> ans[2];
  for (int i = 0; i < n * n; i++) {
    int row = i / n;
    int col = i % n;
    ans[(row + col) % 2] = update((row + col) % 2, row, col, cnt[row + col] + cnt1[row - col + n] - a[i]);
  }
  printf("%d\n", sum[0] + sum[1]);
  for (int i = 0; i < 2; i++) {
    printf("%d %d ", ans[i].first + 1, ans[i].second + 1);
  }
}

int main() {
  cp();
  solve();
  return 0;
}
```
