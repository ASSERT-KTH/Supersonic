Step 1: Remove unnecessary includes
The program includes several unnecessary header files such as `<algorithm>`, `<cmath>`, `<set>`, and `<utility>`. Since they are not used in the program, we can remove them to improve compilation time and reduce memory usage.

Step 2: Remove unnecessary macros
The program defines several macros such as `_rep`, `_dep`, `PII`, and others, which are not used in the program. We can remove these macros to simplify the code and improve readability.

Step 3: Remove unnecessary typedefs
The program defines several typedefs such as `ll`, `ull`, `VI`, `VII`, `VL`, and `VLL`, which are not used in the program. We can remove these typedefs to simplify the code and reduce memory usage.

Step 4: Optimize prime factorization
In the inner loop, the program checks if `j * j` is a divisor of `a[i]` and divides `a[i]` by `(j * j)` until it is no longer divisible. However, we can optimize this process by checking divisibility by `j` only once and dividing `a[i]` by `j * j` directly if it is divisible. This will reduce the number of iterations in the inner loop and improve the runtime.

Step 5: Optimize set operations
In the second loop, the program checks if `a[i]` is already present in the set `s` using the `count()` function. If it is present, the program clears the set and increments the answer. However, we can optimize this process by using the `insert()` function directly, which will insert `a[i]` into the set if it is not already present and return a pair of iterator and a boolean indicating whether the element was inserted or not. We can use this information to update the answer and continue the loop without clearing the set.

Step 6: Optimize input/output operations
The program uses `cin.tie(nullptr), cout.tie(nullptr)` to untie the input and output streams, which may improve performance by reducing synchronization between them. However, in this program, there are no input/output operations that require synchronization, so we can remove these lines.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <set>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  int t;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    int n, k;
    cin >> n >> k;
    vector<int> a(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
      cin >> a[i];
      for (int j = 2; j * j <= a[i]; j++) {
        if (a[i] % j == 0) {
          while (a[i] % (j * j) == 0)
            a[i] /= (j * j);
          break;
        }
      }
    }
    set<int> s;
    int ans = 1;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
      auto it = s.insert(a[i]);
      if (!it.second) {
        ans++;
      }
    }
    cout << ans << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized program removes unnecessary includes, macros, and typedefs, optimizes the prime factorization process, optimizes set operations, and simplifies input/output operations. It should have improved running time and memory usage compared to the original program.
