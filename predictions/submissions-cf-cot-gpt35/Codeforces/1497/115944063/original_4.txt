Step 1: Remove unnecessary header files.
The program includes several header files that are not used in the code. We can remove them to improve compilation time and reduce memory usage.

Step 2: Remove unnecessary macros.
The program defines some macros that are not used in the code. We can remove them to simplify the code.

Step 3: Remove unnecessary typedefs.
The program defines some typedefs that are not used in the code. We can remove them to simplify the code.

Step 4: Optimize the prime factorization loop.
The program uses a loop to find the prime factors of each element in the array. We can optimize this loop by checking for prime factors up to the square root of the element, instead of checking up to the element itself.

Step 5: Optimize the duplicate checking loop.
The program uses a set to check for duplicate elements in the array. However, we can optimize this loop by using a simple boolean array to keep track of the elements we have already seen.

Step 6: Remove unnecessary clear() call.
The program unnecessarily calls the clear() function on the set whenever a duplicate element is found. Since we are going to insert all elements again in the next iteration, we can remove this clear() call.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <set>
#include <cmath>

using namespace std;

int main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(nullptr), cout.tie(nullptr);
  
  int _;
  cin >> _;
  
  while (_--) {
    int n, k;
    cin >> n >> k;
    
    vector<int> a(n);
    
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
      cin >> a[i];
      
      for (int j = 2; j * j <= a[i]; ++j) {
        while (a[i] % (j * j) == 0)
          a[i] /= (j * j);
      }
    }
    
    vector<bool> seen(n, false);
    int ans = 1;
    
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
      if (seen[a[i]]) {
        fill(seen.begin(), seen.end(), false);
        ans++;
      }
      seen[a[i]] = true;
    }
    
    cout << ans << endl;
  }
  
  return 0;
}
```
