The given program calculates the number of distinct square-free numbers in an array. It does this by iterating over each element in the array, factoring out any square factors, and then counting the number of distinct elements.

To optimize the program, we can make the following modifications:
1. Remove unnecessary header files: The program includes several unnecessary header files that are not used. We can remove them to improve compilation time and reduce memory usage.
2. Remove unnecessary macros: The program defines several macros that are not used. We can remove them to simplify the code.
3. Use `reserve` for vector: The program uses a vector to store the input array. We can use the `reserve` function to preallocate memory for the vector, as we know the size of the array in advance. This can improve memory usage and reduce the number of reallocations.
4. Use `unordered_set` instead of `set`: The program uses a set to store the distinct elements. We can use an `unordered_set` instead, which has a faster average lookup time. This can improve the overall runtime of the program.
5. Use prefix increment: The program uses postfix increment (`i++`) in the for loop. We can use prefix increment (`++i`) instead, which can be slightly faster in some cases.
6. Remove unnecessary clearing of set: The program clears the set when a duplicate element is found. This is not necessary, as we can simply continue adding elements to the set without clearing it.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_set>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(nullptr), cout.tie(nullptr);
  
  int t;
  cin >> t;
  
  while (t--) {
    int n, k;
    cin >> n >> k;
    
    vector<int> a(n);
    a.reserve(n);
    
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
      cin >> a[i];
      
      for (int j = 2; j * j <= a[i]; ++j) {
        while (a[i] % (j * j) == 0)
          a[i] /= (j * j);
      }
    }
    
    unordered_set<int> s;
    int ans = 1;
    
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
      if (s.count(a[i])) {
        ans++;
      }
      s.insert(a[i]);
    }
    
    cout << ans << endl;
  }
  
  return 0;
}
```

These optimizations should improve the performance of the program by reducing memory usage and improving runtime.
