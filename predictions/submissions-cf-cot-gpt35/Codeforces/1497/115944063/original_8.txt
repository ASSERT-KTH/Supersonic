Step 1: Remove unnecessary headers
- The `<algorithm>`, `<cmath>`, and `<utility>` headers are not used in the program, so we can remove them to improve compilation time and memory usage.

Step 2: Remove unnecessary typedefs
- The typedefs `PII`, `VII`, `VL`, and `VLL` are not used in the program, so we can remove them to improve compilation time and memory usage.

Step 3: Use `reserve` for vector initialization
- Instead of initializing the vector `a` with a size of `n`, we can use the `reserve` function to allocate memory for `n` elements in advance. This can improve memory usage.

Step 4: Use `unordered_set` instead of `set`
- The use of `set` in the program can be replaced with `unordered_set` to improve the performance of set operations.

Step 5: Replace `count` with `find`
- Instead of using the `count` function to check if an element exists in a set, we can use the `find` function and compare it with the `end` iterator. This can optimize the set lookup.

Step 6: Optimize loop condition
- In the inner loop, the condition `j * j <= a[i]` can be optimized by calculating the square root of `a[i]` outside the loop and storing it in a variable.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_set>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

#define _rep(i, x, y) for (int i = (int)x; i < (int)y; ++i)

int main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(nullptr), cout.tie(nullptr);
  int _;
  cin >> _;
  while (_--) {
    int n, k;
    cin >> n >> k;
    vector<int> a;
    a.reserve(n);
    _rep(i, 0, n) {
      int num;
      cin >> num;
      int sqrtNum = sqrt(num);
      for (int j = 2; j * j <= sqrtNum; j++) {
        while (num % (j * j) == 0)
          num /= (j * j);
      }
      a.push_back(num);
    }
    unordered_set<int> s;
    int ans = 1;
    _rep(i, 0, n) {
      if (s.find(a[i]) != s.end()) {
        s.clear();
        ans++;
      }
      s.insert(a[i]);
    }
    cout << ans << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Explanation:
- The unnecessary headers `<algorithm>`, `<cmath>`, and `<utility>` are removed to improve compilation time and memory usage.
- The unnecessary typedefs `PII`, `VII`, `VL`, and `VLL` are removed to improve compilation time and memory usage.
- The vector `a` is initialized using the `reserve` function to allocate memory for `n` elements in advance, improving memory usage.
- The `set` is replaced with `unordered_set` to improve the performance of set operations.
- The `count` function is replaced with `find` function to optimize the set lookup.
- The loop condition `j * j <= a[i]` is optimized by calculating the square root of `a[i]` outside the loop and storing it in a variable.
