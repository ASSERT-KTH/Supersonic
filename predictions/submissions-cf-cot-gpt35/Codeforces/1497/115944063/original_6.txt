Step 1: Remove unnecessary headers
- The program includes several unnecessary headers such as `<cmath>` and `<utility>`. Since they are not used in the program, we can remove them.

Step 2: Remove unnecessary macros
- The program defines several unnecessary macros such as `_rep`, `_dep`, `PII`, `eb`, `pb`, `fi`, `se`, `PQ`, `lb`, `ub`, `all`, `rall`. Since they are not used in the program, we can remove them.

Step 3: Optimize the loop for checking square factors
- The program currently uses a loop to check for square factors of each number in the input array. However, we can optimize this by using the `sqrt` function to determine the maximum value of `j` in the loop. This will reduce the number of iterations.
- Instead of iterating `j` from 2 to `sqrt(a[i])`, we can iterate `j` from 2 to `sqrt(a[i]) + 1`. This is because the `sqrt` function returns a floating-point value, and we want to include the integer value of `sqrt(a[i])` in the loop.

Step 4: Optimize the set operations
- The program currently uses a set to keep track of distinct numbers encountered so far. However, we can optimize this by using a boolean array to keep track of whether a number has been encountered or not. This will reduce the memory usage and improve the performance.
- Instead of using `set<int> s`, we can use `bool encountered[KINF]` where `KINF` is the maximum possible value of `n` (the input size). We can initialize this array with `false` values at the beginning of each test case.

Step 5: Optimize the input/output operations
- The program currently uses `cin` and `cout` for input/output operations. However, these operations are relatively slower compared to other input/output methods such as `scanf` and `printf`. We can optimize this by using `scanf` and `printf` instead.

Step 6: Optimize the vector initialization
- The program currently initializes the vector `a` with a size of `n` and then assigns values to its elements using a loop. However, we can optimize this by using the `resize` function to resize the vector to `n` elements and then directly read the values into the vector using `scanf`.

Here is the optimized program:

```
#include <iostream>
#include <set>
#include <vector>
#include <cmath>
using namespace std;

constexpr int KINF = 0x3f3f3f3f;

int main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(nullptr), cout.tie(nullptr);
  int _;
  scanf("%d", &_);
  while (_--) {
    int n, k;
    scanf("%d %d", &n, &k);
    vector<int> a;
    a.resize(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
      scanf("%d", &a[i]);
      for (int j = 2; j * j <= a[i]; j++) {
        while (a[i] % (j * j) == 0)
          a[i] /= (j * j);
      }
    }
    bool encountered[KINF] = {false};
    int ans = 1;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
      if (encountered[a[i]]) {
        fill(encountered, encountered + KINF, false);
        ans++;
      }
      encountered[a[i]] = true;
    }
    printf("%d\n", ans);
  }
  return 0;
}
```
