Step 1: Remove unnecessary header files and preprocessor directives.

- The program includes the header file `<bits/stdc++.h>`, which includes all the standard library header files. This can lead to slower compilation times and increased memory usage. We can remove this and include the specific header files that are required.

- The preprocessor directives `#define int long long`, `#define hell 1000000007`, and `#define endl "\n"` are not used in the program. We can remove them.

- The preprocessor directives `#define F first` and `#define S second` are not used in the program. We can remove them.

- The preprocessor directives `#define gcd(a, b) __gcd((a), (b))` and `#define lcm(a, b) ((a) * (b)) / gcd(a, b)` are not used in the program. We can remove them.

- The preprocessor directive `#define ONLINE_JUDGE` is not used in the program. We can remove it.

- The preprocessor directive `#define ios ...` is used to optimize input/output operations. We can keep it.

Step 2: Remove unnecessary function definitions.

- The functions `expo` and `inverse` are not used in the program. We can remove them.

Step 3: Optimize the input/output operations.

- The program uses `cin` and `cout` for input/output operations, which are slower compared to other methods like `scanf` and `printf`. We can modify the program to use `scanf` and `printf` instead.

Step 4: Optimize the loop.

- The program uses a loop to read the elements of the array `a`. We can modify the program to read the elements directly into the array using `scanf`.

Step 5: Optimize the condition inside the loop.

- The condition inside the loop checks whether `t` is even and `a[i]` is equal to `t / 2`. We can optimize this condition by checking whether `t` is divisible by `2` and `a[i]` is equal to `t / 2` in a single condition.

Step 6: Optimize the modulo operation.

- The program uses the modulo operation `%` to calculate the remainder. This operation can be slow for large numbers. We can optimize this operation by using bitwise AND `&` instead.

Step 7: Optimize the output.

- The program uses `cout` to display the result. We can modify the program to use `printf` instead.

Step 8: Remove unnecessary variables.

- The variable `r` is only used inside the loop. We can remove it and directly print the result inside the loop.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

void solve() {
  int n, t;
  scanf("%d %d", &n, &t);
  int a[n];
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    scanf("%d", &a[i]);
  }
  int curMid = 1;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    if ((t & 1) && (a[i] == t / 2)) {
      printf("%d ", (curMid++) & 1);
    } else if (2 * a[i] < t) {
      printf("0 ");
    } else {
      printf("1 ");
    }
  }
  printf("\n");
}

int main() {
  int t;
  scanf("%d", &t);
  while (t--) {
    solve();
  }
  return 0;
}
```
