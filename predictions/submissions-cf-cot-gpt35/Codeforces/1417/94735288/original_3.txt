Step 1: Remove unnecessary headers

The program includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header, which is not a standard C++ header and may include unnecessary headers. It is recommended to include only the necessary headers to improve compilation time and reduce memory usage.

Step 2: Remove unnecessary preprocessor directives

The program has several unnecessary preprocessor directives, such as `#define int long long` and `#define hell 1000000007`. These directives redefine the type `int` and define a constant `hell`. It is recommended to remove these directives as they are not used in the program.

Step 3: Avoid using `using namespace std`

The program uses the `using namespace std` directive, which brings all the names from the `std` namespace into the global scope. This can lead to naming conflicts and make the code harder to read and maintain. It is recommended to avoid using `using namespace std` and instead use the `std::` prefix for standard library names.

Step 4: Avoid unnecessary function calls

The program uses the `__gcd()` function from the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header to calculate the greatest common divisor. However, the program also defines its own `gcd()` function using the `__gcd()` function. It is recommended to remove the `gcd()` and `lcm()` function definitions and use the `__gcd()` and `std::lcm()` functions directly.

Step 5: Avoid unnecessary modulo operations

The `inverse()` function calculates the inverse of a number modulo `hell` using the `expo()` function. However, the `expo()` function already takes care of modulo operations. It is recommended to remove the `inverse()` function and use the `expo()` function directly.

Step 6: Optimize input/output operations

The program uses `cin` and `cout` for input and output operations, which can be slower compared to other input/output methods such as `scanf()` and `printf()`. It is recommended to use `scanf()` and `printf()` for faster input/output.

Step 7: Optimize the loop

The program has two nested loops to read the input array `a` and calculate the result array `r`. However, the loops can be combined into a single loop to improve performance.

Step 8: Remove unnecessary variables

The variable `curMid` in the loop is only used to calculate `r` and is not used outside the loop. It is recommended to remove the `curMid` variable and calculate `r` directly.

Step 9: Optimize the modulo operation

The `r` value is calculated based on the condition `2 * a[i] < t`. Instead of calculating `2 * a[i]`, we can calculate `t` as `2 * a[i]` and directly compare it with `t` to improve performance.

Step 10: Optimize the output operation

The program uses `cout` to output the result array `r` element by element. However, this can be slow for large arrays. It is recommended to use `printf()` to output the result array in a single line.

Step 11: Remove unnecessary comments

There are some unnecessary comments in the program that can be removed to improve code readability.

Here is the optimized C++ program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int expo(int base, int exponent, int mod) {
  int ans = 1;
  base %= mod;
  while (exponent != 0) {
    if (exponent & 1)
      ans = (1LL * ans * base) % mod;
    base = (1LL * base * base) % mod;
    exponent >>= 1;
  }
  return ans % mod;
}

void solve() {
  int n, t;
  std::cin >> n >> t;
  int a[n];
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    std::cin >> a[i];
  }
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    int r;
    if (t % 2 == 0 && a[i] == t / 2) {
      r = i % 2;
    } else if (2 * a[i] < t) {
      r = 0;
    } else {
      r = 1;
    }
    std::cout << r << " ";
  }
  std::cout << std::endl;
}

int main() {
  int t;
  std::cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    solve();
  }
  return 0;
}
```
