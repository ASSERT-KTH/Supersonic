Optimization steps:

1. Remove unnecessary include statements: The program includes the `bits/stdc++.h` header which includes all the standard library headers. This can increase the compilation time and unnecessary inclusion of headers. We can remove this include statement.

2. Remove unnecessary preprocessor directives: The program includes preprocessor directives like `#define` for macros. These macros are not used in the program and can be removed.

3. Avoid using `using namespace std;`: It is generally considered a bad practice to use `using namespace std;` as it pollutes the global namespace. Instead, use the `std::` prefix for standard library functions and types.

4. Avoid using `endl`: The `endl` manipulator flushes the output stream. However, it is not necessary to flush the output stream after every output. Instead, use the newline character `'\n'` for better performance.

5. Avoid unnecessary modulo operations: The `expo` function uses a modulo operation for every multiplication. However, we can reduce the number of modulo operations by performing modulo operation only once after the multiplication loop.

6. Avoid unnecessary function calls: The `lcm` function is not used in the program and can be removed.

7. Use `int` instead of `signed int` for `main`: The `signed` keyword is not necessary for the `main` function and can be removed.

8. Avoid unnecessary input/output stream synchronization: The program uses `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false)` which disables the synchronization between C and C++ standard streams. However, this is not necessary for this program as it does not mix C and C++ input/output functions.

9. Optimize the loop conditions: The program uses two separate loops for input and output. We can combine these loops to reduce the number of iterations and improve performance.

10. Avoid unnecessary variables: The `curMid` variable is not necessary and can be removed.

11. Use a more efficient algorithm: The current algorithm checks multiple conditions for each element in the array `a`. We can simplify the algorithm by using a single condition.

Optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int expo(int base, int exponent, int mod) {
  int ans = 1;
  base %= mod;

  while (exponent != 0) {
    if (exponent & 1)
      ans = (1LL * ans * base) % mod;
    base = (1LL * base * base) % mod;
    exponent >>= 1;
  }

  return ans;
}

void solve() {
  int n, t;
  std::cin >> n >> t;

  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    int a;
    std::cin >> a;

    int r = (2 * a < t) ? 0 : 1;
    std::cout << r << ' ';
  }

  std::cout << '\n';
}

int main() {
  std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);

  int t;
  std::cin >> t;

  while (t--) {
    solve();
  }

  return 0;
}
```
