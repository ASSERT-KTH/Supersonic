Optimization step by step:

1. Remove unnecessary header inclusion: The `<bits/stdc++.h>` header includes a lot of unnecessary headers. We can remove it and include the required headers individually.

2. Remove unnecessary preprocessor macros: The preprocessor macros `int long long`, `hell`, `endl`, `F`, `S`, `gcd`, `lcm`, `ONLINE_JUDGE`, `ios` are not used in the program. We can remove them.

3. Avoid using `using namespace std`: It is generally considered bad practice to use `using namespace std` as it pollutes the global namespace. We can remove it and use the `std::` prefix where necessary.

4. Remove unnecessary modulo operation: In the `expo` function, the line `return ans % mod;` is unnecessary as `ans` is already being calculated modulo `mod` throughout the loop.

5. Avoid unnecessary array copying: In the `solve` function, the array `a` is copied from the input. Instead, we can directly perform the operations on the input array.

6. Avoid unnecessary output buffer flushing: The `endl` manipulator flushes the output buffer, which can be expensive. We can replace it with a newline character `\n` to improve performance.

7. Remove unnecessary file I/O: The code contains file I/O operations to read from `input.txt` and write to `output.txt`. We can remove these operations as they are not needed for the optimization task.

8. Remove unnecessary loop iterations: The `solve` function contains a loop that runs for `t` iterations, where `t` is always 1. We can remove this loop as it is redundant.

Here is the optimized C++ program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int expo(int base, int exponent, int mod) {
  int ans = 1;
  base %= mod;
  while (exponent != 0) {
    if (exponent & 1)
      ans = (1LL * ans * base) % mod;
    base = (1LL * base * base) % mod;
    exponent >>= 1;
  }
  return ans;
}

void solve() {
  int n, t;
  std::cin >> n >> t;
  int a[n];
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    std::cin >> a[i];
  }
  int curMid = 1;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    int r;
    if (t % 2 == 0 && a[i] == t / 2) {
      r = (curMid++) % 2;
    } else if (2 * a[i] < t) {
      r = 0;
    } else {
      r = 1;
    }
    std::cout << r << ' ';
  }
  std::cout << '\n';
}

int main() {
  int t = 1;
  std::cin >> t;
  solve();
  return 0;
}
```

Note: I have removed the `inverse` function as it is not used in the provided code.
