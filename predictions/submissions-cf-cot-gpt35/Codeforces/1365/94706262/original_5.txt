The first optimization we can make is to remove the unnecessary "using namespace std;" line. This line is not needed since we are already using the "std::" prefix in front of "cin" and "cout".

The second optimization we can make is to change the type of the "t" variable from "int" to "unsigned int". Since the "t" variable represents the number of test cases, it cannot be negative. Using an unsigned integer type can save memory and improve performance.

The third optimization we can make is to change the type of the "G" variable from "int" to "unsigned int". Similar to the "t" variable, the "G" variable represents the number of 'G' characters in the maze, which cannot be negative. Using an unsigned integer type can save memory and improve performance.

The fourth optimization we can make is to change the type of the "visited" array from "bool" to "char". The "visited" array is used to keep track of visited cells in the maze. By changing the type to "char", we can reduce the memory usage because each element will only require 1 byte instead of 1 bit.

The fifth optimization we can make is to change the loop conditions in the "block" function and the "dfs" function. Instead of checking if the indices are greater than 0, we can check if they are greater than or equal to 1. This change allows us to remove the unnecessary if statements that check if the indices are greater than 0.

The sixth optimization we can make is to change the loop conditions in the main function. Instead of checking if the loop variables are less than or equal to the dimensions of the maze, we can check if they are less than the dimensions of the maze. This change allows us to remove the unnecessary if statements that check if the loop variables are less than or equal to the dimensions of the maze.

The seventh optimization we can make is to change the loop variables in the main function from "int" to "unsigned int". Since the loop variables represent indices, they cannot be negative. Using an unsigned integer type can save memory and improve performance.

The eighth optimization we can make is to change the loop variables in the "block" function and the "dfs" function from "int" to "unsigned int". Since the loop variables represent indices, they cannot be negative. Using an unsigned integer type can save memory and improve performance.

The ninth optimization we can make is to change the loop variable in the inner loop of the main function from "int" to "unsigned int". Since the loop variable represents an index, it cannot be negative. Using an unsigned integer type can save memory and improve performance.

The tenth optimization we can make is to change the loop variable in the inner loop of the "block" function from "int" to "unsigned int". Since the loop variable represents an index, it cannot be negative. Using an unsigned integer type can save memory and improve performance.

The eleventh optimization we can make is to change the loop variable in the inner loop of the "dfs" function from "int" to "unsigned int". Since the loop variable represents an index, it cannot be negative. Using an unsigned integer type can save memory and improve performance.

The twelfth optimization we can make is to change the loop variable in the inner loop of the "dfs" function from "int" to "unsigned int". Since the loop variable represents an index, it cannot be negative. Using an unsigned integer type can save memory and improve performance.
