The given program is a C++ program that reads an integer `n` and a string `s`, and then finds the shortest subarray of `s` such that the sum of its characters (converted to numeric values) is zero.

To optimize the program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The program includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` library, which includes many other standard C++ libraries. However, this is not necessary for this program as it only uses a few standard libraries. Therefore, we can remove this line to reduce unnecessary code and decrease compilation time.

2. Remove unnecessary type definitions: The program defines several type aliases (`ll`, `oo`, `OO`, `mod`, `N`) which are not used in the program. We can remove these type definitions to simplify the code.

3. Remove unnecessary template function: The program defines a template function `sort` that is not used. We can remove this function to reduce unnecessary code.

4. Avoid unnecessary string concatenation: The program concatenates a space character to the beginning of the input string `s` (`s = " " + s`). This is not necessary for the algorithm and can be removed.

5. Replace `map` with `unordered_map`: The program uses a `map` to store the prefix sum values and their corresponding indices. However, since we do not need the sum values to be sorted, we can use an `unordered_map` instead, which has a lower time complexity for insertion and lookup operations.

6. Avoid unnecessary repeated calculations: The program calculates the same values multiple times inside the loop, such as `right - left + 1` and `i + 1`. We can calculate these values once and store them in variables to avoid repeated calculations.

7. Avoid unnecessary if-conditions: The program uses multiple if-conditions to check the character at each position in the string `s`. However, we can use a switch statement to simplify the code and improve readability.

Here is the optimized C++ program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>
using namespace std;

void run_case() {
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  string s;
  cin >> s;

  unordered_map<long long, int> mp;
  long long sum = 0;
  mp[0] = 1;
  int l = 0, r = 0, ans = n + 1;

  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    switch (s[i]) {
      case 'L':
        sum += 1e9;
        break;
      case 'R':
        sum -= 1e9;
        break;
      case 'U':
        sum += 7;
        break;
      case 'D':
        sum -= 7;
        break;
    }

    if (mp.count(sum) != 0) {
      int left = mp[sum];
      int right = i + 1;
      int length = right - left + 1;
      if (length < ans) {
        ans = length;
        l = left;
        r = right;
      }
    }

    mp[sum] = i + 2;
  }

  if (ans == n + 1) {
    cout << "-1\n";
  } else {
    cout << l << " " << r << "\n";
  }
}

int main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(false), cin.tie(nullptr);
  int tc = 1;
  cin >> tc;
  while (tc--) {
    run_case();
  }

  return 0;
}
```

The optimized program reduces unnecessary code and calculations, uses an unordered map for faster lookups, and simplifies if-conditions using a switch statement. These optimizations should improve the running time and memory usage of the program.
