The given program appears to find the shortest substring in a given string that contains a specific pattern. The program uses a map to store the sum of occurrences of each character in the pattern. It then iterates through the string, updating the sum based on the current character and checking if the current sum has occurred before. If it has, it updates the answer if the length of the current substring is smaller than the previous answer.

To optimize this program, we can make the following changes:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The program includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header, which is not a standard C++ header and includes a large number of other headers. We can remove this line and include only the necessary headers.

2. Remove unnecessary typedefs: The program typedefs `long long` as `ll`. Since `long long` is already a well-known type, we can remove this typedef and use `long long` directly.

3. Remove unnecessary constants: The program defines constants `oo`, `OO`, and `mod`, but they are not used in the code. We can remove these constants.

4. Remove unnecessary template function: The program defines a template function `sort` that is not used in the code. We can remove this function.

5. Use `unordered_map` instead of `map`: The program uses a `map` to store the sum and the index of each occurrence. However, since the order of occurrence does not matter in this case, we can use an `unordered_map` instead, which has a slightly faster average lookup time.

6. Use a constant variable instead of a literal value: The program checks if `mp[sum]` is not equal to 0. Instead of using a literal value of 0, we can define a constant variable to improve readability.

7. Optimize the substring length calculation: The program calculates the length of the current substring by subtracting the left index from the right index and adding 1. However, since the left index is always 1, we can simplify this calculation by subtracting 1 from the right index.

8. Use '\n' instead of std::endl: The program uses `endl` to end a line, which flushes the output stream. This can be slow, so we can use `'\n'` instead to improve performance.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <unordered_map>

void run_case() {
  int n;
  std::cin >> n;
  std::string s;
  std::cin >> s;
  s = " " + s;
  std::unordered_map<long long, int> mp;
  long long sum = 0;
  mp[0] = 1;
  int l = 0, r = 0, ans = 1e9;
  const int NOT_FOUND = -1;
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    if (s[i] == 'L')
      sum += 1e9;
    if (s[i] == 'R')
      sum -= 1e9;
    if (s[i] == 'U')
      sum += 7;
    if (s[i] == 'D')
      sum -= 7;
    if (mp[sum] != NOT_FOUND) {
      int left = mp[sum];
      int right = i;
      if ((right - left + 1) < ans) {
        ans = right - left + 1;
        l = left;
        r = right;
      }
    }
    mp[sum] = i + 1;
  }
  if (ans == 1e9) {
    std::cout << "-1\n";
  } else {
    std::cout << l << " " << r << "\n";
  }
}

int main() {
  std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  std::cin.tie(nullptr);
  int tc = 1;
  std::cin >> tc;
  while (tc--) {
    run_case();
  }
}
```

By making these optimizations, we have improved the efficiency of the program while keeping the logic and structure intact.
