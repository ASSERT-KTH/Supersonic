The given program reads a number `test` as input and then for each test case, it reads an integer `n` followed by `n` more integers. It counts the number of even and odd integers and prints "YES" if there is at least one odd integer and either there are no even integers or the count of odd integers is even. Otherwise, it prints "NO".

To optimize the program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary header inclusion: The line `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` includes a large number of standard library headers, which is unnecessary for this program. We can remove it and include only the necessary headers.

2. Remove unnecessary input/output synchronization: The lines `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);`, `cin.tie(NULL);`, and `cout.tie(NULL);` are used to disable the synchronization between C and C++ standard streams, but they are unnecessary for this program as there is no mixing of C and C++ input/output operations. We can remove these lines.

3. Avoid using a temporary variable in the for loop: In the for loop, a temporary variable `temp` is used to read the input integers. We can eliminate the use of this temporary variable by directly reading the integers into the array `a`.

4. Simplify the condition in the cout statement: The condition in the cout statement is quite complex. We can simplify it by breaking it down into multiple conditions and using logical operators.

Here is the optimized C++ program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int test;
  cin >> test;
  
  while (test--) {
    int n;
    cin >> n;
    
    int a[2] = {};
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      cin >> a[i % 2];
    }
    
    bool hasOdd = a[1] > 0;
    bool hasEven = a[0] > 0;
    bool isEvenCount = a[1] % 2 == 0;
    
    if (hasOdd && (!hasEven || isEvenCount)) {
      cout << "YES\n";
    } else {
      cout << "NO\n";
    }
  }
  
  return 0;
}
```
