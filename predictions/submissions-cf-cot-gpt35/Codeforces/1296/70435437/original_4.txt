Step 1: Remove unnecessary includes
The program includes the entire `bits/stdc++.h` header, which is not necessary. We can remove this line.

Step 2: Optimize I/O operations
The program uses `cin` and `cout` for input and output respectively. These I/O operations are generally slower than the standard C I/O operations (`scanf` and `printf`). We can modify the program to use `scanf` and `printf` for faster I/O.

Step 3: Optimize loop condition
The loop condition `i++ < n` can be simplified to `i < n` and we can increment `i` in the loop body. This avoids the unnecessary increment operation in each iteration.

Step 4: Optimize array initialization
The array `a[2]` is initialized with `0`. We can optimize this by using `memset` to set all elements to `0` in one operation.

Step 5: Simplify conditional expression
The conditional expression `a[1] == 0 || (a[0] == 0 && (a[1] % 2 == 0))` can be simplified to `a[1] == 0 || (a[0] == 0 && a[1] % 2 == 0)`. The extra parentheses are not necessary.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <cstdio>
#include <cstring>

int main() {
  int test;
  scanf("%d", &test);
  while (test--) {
    int n, a[2];
    memset(a, 0, sizeof(a));
    scanf("%d", &n);
    for (int temp, i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      scanf("%d", &temp);
      a[temp % 2]++;
    }
    printf("%s\n", (a[1] == 0 || (a[0] == 0 && a[1] % 2 == 0)) ? "NO" : "YES");
  }
  return 0;
}
```
