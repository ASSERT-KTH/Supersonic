The given program reads an integer `test` as the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and `n` elements into an array `a`. Then it checks if the array `a` has either all even elements or all odd elements, and prints "YES" if the condition is satisfied, otherwise it prints "NO".

To optimize this program, we can make the following improvements:

1. Remove unnecessary header file inclusion. The `<bits/stdc++.h>` header file includes a large number of standard library header files, which is unnecessary for this program. We can remove it and include only the necessary header files.

2. Avoid using `using namespace std;`. It is a good practice to avoid using `using namespace std;` as it can cause naming conflicts. Instead, we can use the `std::` prefix to specify the standard library functions and objects.

3. Avoid unnecessary input/output synchronization. The `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false)` and `cin.tie(NULL)` statements are used to disable the synchronization between C and C++ standard streams for faster input/output. However, in this program, the input/output operations are minimal, so we can remove these statements.

4. Use a single variable to count the number of odd elements in the array instead of using an array `a`. Since we are only interested in the count of odd elements, we don't need to store the count of even elements separately.

5. Use a boolean variable to track if the array has all even or all odd elements, instead of checking the count of odd elements and even elements separately.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  int test;
  std::cin >> test;
  
  while (test--) {
    int n, oddCount = 0;
    bool allEvenOrOdd = true;
    std::cin >> n;
    
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      int temp;
      std::cin >> temp;
      
      if (temp % 2 != 0) {
        oddCount++;
        
        if (oddCount > 1) {
          allEvenOrOdd = false;
        }
      }
    }
    
    if (allEvenOrOdd) {
      std::cout << "YES\n";
    } else {
      std::cout << "NO\n";
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized program removes unnecessary code and variables, resulting in improved running time and reduced memory usage.
