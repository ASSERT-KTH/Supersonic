The given program reads an integer `test` as input, and then for each test case, it reads an integer `n` followed by `n` integers. It counts the number of even and odd integers in the input, and based on those counts, it prints either "NO" or "YES".

To optimize the program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary headers: The program includes the `bits/stdc++.h` header, which includes a large number of C++ standard library headers. This can increase the compile time and memory usage. We can replace it with the specific headers that are actually used in the program, which are `iostream` and `algorithm`.

2. Remove unnecessary `ios_base` synchronization: The program calls `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false)` to disable the synchronization between C and C++ standard streams. However, this synchronization is not necessary for this program as it does not mix C and C++ I/O operations. We can remove this line.

3. Remove unnecessary `cin.tie` and `cout.tie`: The program calls `cin.tie(NULL)` and `cout.tie(NULL)` to untie `cin` and `cout` from `cerr` and `clog`. However, this is not necessary for this program as it does not use `cerr` or `clog`. We can remove these lines.

4. Optimize the loop: The loop that reads the `n` integers and counts the number of even and odd integers can be optimized. Currently, it uses the pre-increment operator `++i` and assigns `temp % 2` to `a[temp % 2]`. We can simplify this by using the post-increment operator `i++` and directly incrementing `a[temp % 2]` without assigning it to a temporary variable.

5. Optimize the condition: The condition `(a[1] == 0 || (a[0] == 0 && (a[1] % 2 == 0))` can be simplified. If `a[1]` is zero, it means there are no odd integers, so the answer is always "NO". If `a[0]` is zero and `a[1]` is even, it means there are no even integers and all the integers are odd, so the answer is also "NO". We can simplify the condition to `a[1] != 0 && (a[0] != 0 || a[1] % 2 != 0)`.

Here is the optimized C++ program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int test;
  cin >> test;
  while (test--) {
    int n, a[2] = {};
    cin >> n;
    for (int temp, i = 0; i++ < n; ++i)
      cin >> temp, ++a[temp % 2];
    cout << (a[1] != 0 && (a[0] != 0 || a[1] % 2 != 0) ? "YES\n" : "NO\n");
  }
}
```
