Step 1: Remove unnecessary header file
The program includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header file, which is not necessary for this program. We can remove it.

Step 2: Remove unnecessary I/O optimizations
The program uses `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false)`, `cin.tie(NULL)`, and `cout.tie(NULL)` to optimize I/O. However, these optimizations are not necessary for this program. We can remove them.

Step 3: Optimize the loop
The loop that calculates the count of even and odd numbers can be optimized. Instead of using the `%` operator inside the loop, we can use a bitwise AND operator (`&`) to check if a number is even or odd. This is a faster operation.

Step 4: Simplify the condition for output
The condition for output can be simplified. Instead of checking if `a[1] == 0` or `a[0] == 0 && a[1] % 2 == 0`, we can check if `a[1] == 0 || a[1] % 2 == 0`. This simplification reduces the number of conditions to be checked.

Optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int test;
  cin >> test;
  while (test--) {
    int n, a[2] = {};
    cin >> n;
    for (int temp, i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      cin >> temp;
      a[temp & 1]++;
    }
    cout << (a[1] == 0 || a[1] % 2 == 0 ? "NO\n" : "YES\n");
  }
}
```
