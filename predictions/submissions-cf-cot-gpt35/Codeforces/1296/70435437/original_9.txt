The given program reads an integer `test` which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and then `n` integers. It counts the number of even and odd integers in the input and prints "YES" if there is at least one odd integer and either no even integers or there are even number of odd integers. Otherwise, it prints "NO".

To optimize the program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove the unnecessary `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` header. This header includes all the standard library headers, which may slow down the compilation process.

2. Remove the `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false)`, `cin.tie(NULL)`, and `cout.tie(NULL)` statements. These statements disable the synchronization between C and C++ standard I/O streams, which can improve the performance of C++ stream I/O. However, in this program, we are not using any C standard I/O functions, so these statements are not needed.

3. Use a more efficient way to count the number of even and odd integers. Instead of using an array to store the counts, we can use two variables `evenCount` and `oddCount` to keep track of the counts. We can increment the corresponding count variable directly while reading the integers.

4. Instead of using the ternary operator and multiple conditions to determine whether to print "YES" or "NO", we can simplify the logic by checking if `oddCount` is greater than 0 and `evenCount` is either 0 or even. If this condition is true, we can directly print "YES", otherwise, we can print "NO".

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int test;
  cin >> test;
  while (test--) {
    int n, evenCount = 0, oddCount = 0;
    cin >> n;
    for (int temp, i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      cin >> temp;
      if (temp % 2 == 0)
        evenCount++;
      else
        oddCount++;
    }
    if (oddCount > 0 && (evenCount == 0 || evenCount % 2 == 0))
      cout << "YES\n";
    else
      cout << "NO\n";
  }
}
```
