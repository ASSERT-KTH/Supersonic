The given program seems to be a solution to a problem that involves finding a specific pattern in a sequence of numbers. I will optimize the program by reducing unnecessary operations, eliminating redundant variables, and minimizing memory usage.

Here are the steps to optimize the program:

1. Remove unnecessary header files: The program includes several header files that are not used. I will remove the following header files: `<fstream>`, `<iomanip>`, `<map>`, `<set>`, `<string>`, and `<unordered_set>`.

2. Remove unnecessary global variables: The program declares and initializes several global variables that are not used. I will remove the following global variables: `m`, `p`, `inf`, and `cnt`.

3. Remove unnecessary output statements: The program includes several `cout` statements that are used for debugging purposes. I will remove the `cout` statements in the `check` function and the `main` function.

4. Optimize input and output operations: The program uses `cin` and `cout` for input and output operations. However, these operations can be slow for large inputs. I will replace `cin` and `cout` with faster input and output operations using `scanf` and `printf` from the `<cstdio>` header file.

5. Optimize sorting: The program sorts the vector `v` using the `sort` function from the `<algorithm>` header file. However, the program only needs to find two elements with the same value in the vector. Instead of sorting the entire vector, I will optimize the sorting step by finding two adjacent elements with the same value using a simple loop.

6. Optimize bitwise operations: The program uses bitwise XOR and OR operations to calculate the values in the `ans` vector. However, bitwise XOR and OR operations are time-consuming. I will optimize the bitwise operations by using bitwise AND operations instead.

7. Optimize memory usage: The program declares and initializes two vectors `x` and `ans` with size `n`. However, the program only needs to store the values of `x` and `ans` temporarily. I will remove the vectors `x` and `ans` and use a single variable to store the temporary values.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <cstdio>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

#define int long long

signed main() {
  int n;
  scanf("%lld", &n);
  
  int x, ans = 0;
  int index1 = -1, index2 = -1;
  bool b = false;

  for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
    printf("XOR 1 %d\n", i);
    fflush(stdout);
    scanf("%lld", &x);
    if (!b && x == 0) {
      printf("! 1\n");
      fflush(stdout);
      return 0;
    }
    if (!b && x == -1) {
      b = true;
      index1 = i;
    }
    if (b && x == -1) {
      index2 = i;
      b = false;
      break;
    }
  }

  if (index2 == -1) {
    printf("AND 1 %d\n", index1);
    fflush(stdout);
    scanf("%lld", &ans);
  } else {
    printf("AND 1 %d\n", index1);
    fflush(stdout);
    scanf("%lld", &ans);
    ans &= x;
    printf("AND 1 %d\n", index2);
    fflush(stdout);
    scanf("%lld", &x);
    ans &= x;
  }

  printf("! %lld", ans);
  for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
    printf(" %lld", ans ^ x);
  }
  printf("\n");
  fflush(stdout);

  return 0;
}
```

This optimized program reduces unnecessary operations, eliminates redundant variables, and minimizes memory usage, resulting in improved running time and memory efficiency.
