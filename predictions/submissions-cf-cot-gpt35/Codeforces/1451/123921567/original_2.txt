The given code is a program that solves a problem using the XOR and AND operations. The program takes an integer `n` as input and performs a series of XOR operations to obtain an array `x`. It then checks for a pair of indices in `x` that have the same XOR value, and performs an AND operation to obtain the missing element in the XOR operation. Finally, it calculates the remaining elements of the array `x` using the obtained value.

To optimize this program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary header files: The program includes several unnecessary header files that are not used. We can remove them to improve compilation time and reduce memory usage.

2. Remove the `using namespace std;` statement: It is generally considered bad practice to use the `using namespace std;` statement in C++. We can remove it and use the `std::` prefix for the standard library functions and objects.

3. Remove the `#define int long long`: The program defines `int` as `long long`, but it is not used in the program. We can remove it as it has no effect on the program.

4. Use `const` instead of `#define` for constants: Instead of using `#define` to define the constant `inf`, we can use the `const` keyword to define it as a constant variable. This is a more modern and safer approach.

5. Avoid unnecessary function calls: The function `check()` is not used in the program. We can remove it to improve runtime and reduce memory usage.

6. Optimize the sorting of `v`: The program sorts the vector `v` using the `sort()` function. However, we can optimize this by using `std::stable_sort()` instead. `std::stable_sort()` is guaranteed to preserve the relative order of elements with equal values, which is what we need in this case. This can improve the performance of the sorting operation.

7. Optimize the loop to find a pair of indices: The loop that checks for a pair of indices in `v` can be optimized by using a single loop instead of two nested loops. We can iterate through `v` and compare each element with its next element, instead of comparing each element with all subsequent elements.

8. Remove unnecessary variables: The variables `m`, `p`, and `cnt` are not used in the program. We can remove them to improve memory usage.

9. Replace `std::flush()` with `"\n"`: The program uses `std::flush()` to flush the output stream. However, this can be replaced with a newline character `"\n"`, which is more efficient and achieves the same result.

10. Remove unnecessary `std::endl`: The program uses `std::endl` to insert a newline character and flush the output stream. However, this is not necessary in this case, as we can manually flush the output stream using `std::flush()` at the end of each output statement.

11. Use `emplace_back()` instead of `push_back()`: Instead of using `push_back()` to add elements to vectors, we can use `emplace_back()` which constructs the element in place, avoiding unnecessary copies or moves.

After applying these optimizations, the optimized program is as follows:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

const int inf = 1e9 + 7;

int main() {
  std::cin.tie(0);
  std::cout.tie(0);
  std::ios::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);

  int n;
  std::cin >> n;

  std::vector<int> x(n, 0), ans(n, 0);
  std::vector<std::pair<int, int>> v(n, {0, 0});

  for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
    std::cout << "XOR 1 " << i << "\n";
    std::cin >> x[i - 1];
    v[i - 1] = {x[i - 1], i - 1};
  }

  std::stable_sort(v.begin(), v.end());

  bool b = false;
  int index1, index2;

  for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
    if (v[i].first == v[i + 1].first) {
      b = true;
      index1 = v[i].second;
      index2 = v[i + 1].second;
      break;
    }
  }

  if (b) {
    std::cout << "AND " << index1 + 1 << " " << index2 + 1 << "\n";
    int a;
    std::cin >> a;
    ans[0] = a ^ x[index1];

    for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
      ans[i] = ans[0] ^ x[i];
    }

    std::cout << "! ";
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      std::cout << ans[i] << ' ';
    }
    std::cout << "\n" << std::flush;
  } else {
    std::cout << "AND 1 " << v[1].second + 1 << "\n";
    int a;
    std::cin >> a;
    ans[0] = a;

    std::cout << "AND 1 " << v[n - 2].second + 1 << "\n";
    std::cin >> a;
    ans[0] |= a;

    for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
      ans[i] = ans[0] ^ x[i];
    }

    std::cout << "! ";
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      std::cout << ans[i] << ' ';
    }
    std::cout << "\n" << std::flush;
  }

  return 0;
}
```

These optimizations should help improve both the running time and memory usage of the program.
