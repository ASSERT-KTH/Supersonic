The given C/C++ program calculates the XOR and AND of certain values and then prints the result. To optimize this program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary header files: The program includes several unnecessary header files such as `<array>`, `<fstream>`, `<iomanip>`, `<map>`, `<set>`, `<string>`, and `<unordered_set>`. Since these header files are not used in the program, we can remove them.

2. Remove unnecessary variables: The program declares several unnecessary variables such as `m`, `p`, and `inf`. Since these variables are not used in the program, we can remove them.

3. Optimize the sorting process: The program sorts the vector `v` using the `sort` function. However, we can optimize this process by using the `stable_sort` function instead. Since the values in `v` are already sorted in ascending order, using `stable_sort` will retain the relative order of elements with equal values, which will be useful later in the program.

4. Use a single variable for boolean value: The program uses two variables with the same name `b` - one is a vector and the other is a boolean variable. To avoid confusion, we can rename the vector variable to `bv` and use a single variable for the boolean value.

5. Remove unnecessary output: The program outputs the value of `x` in the `check` function, but this output is not required for the program logic. We can remove this output statement to improve performance.

6. Optimize the loop condition: In the loop that checks for equal values in `v`, the condition `i < n - 1` can be optimized to `i < n - 2` since there is no need to check the last element of `v`.

7. Optimize the XOR calculation: Instead of calculating `ans[0] ^ x[i]` in the loop, we can calculate `ans[0] ^ x[i - 1]` and assign it to `ans[i]`. This will avoid unnecessary calculations.

8. Optimize the printing process: Instead of using multiple output statements and flushing the output after each statement, we can use a single output statement to print the result and flush the output once.

Here is the optimized C/C++ program:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

#define int long long

vector<bool> bv;
int cnt = 0;

bool check(int x) {
  cout.flush();
  cin >> x;
  if (x == 0)
    exit(0);
  return (x == -1) ^ bv[(cnt++) % bv.size()];
}

signed main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(0);
  
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  
  vector<int> x(n), ans(n);
  vector<pair<int, int>> v(n);
  
  for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
    cout << "XOR 1 " << i << "\n";
    cout.flush();
    cin >> x[i - 1];
    v[i - 1] = {x[i - 1], i - 1};
  }
  
  stable_sort(v.begin(), v.end());
  
  bool b = false;
  int index1, index2;
  
  for (int i = 0; i < n - 2; i++) {
    if (v[i].first == v[i + 1].first) {
      b = true;
      index1 = v[i].second;
      index2 = v[i + 1].second;
      break;
    }
  }
  
  if (b) {
    cout << "AND " << index1 + 1 << " " << index2 + 1 << "\n";
    cout.flush();
    int a;
    cin >> a;
    ans[0] = a ^ x[index1];
    for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
      ans[i] = ans[0] ^ x[i - 1];
    }
  } else {
    cout << "AND 1 " << v[1].second + 1 << "\n";
    cout.flush();
    int a;
    cin >> a;
    ans[0] = a;
    
    cout << "AND 1 " << v[n - 2].second + 1 << "\n";
    cout.flush();
    cin >> a;
    ans[0] |= a;
    
    for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
      ans[i] = ans[0] ^ x[i - 1];
    }
  }
  
  cout << "! ";
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cout << ans[i] << ' ';
  }
  cout << '\n';
  cout.flush();
}
```

By making these optimizations, the program should run more efficiently in terms of both running time and memory usage.
