Step 1: Remove unnecessary header files
The program includes several unnecessary header files such as <algorithm>, <bitset>, <cmath>, <cstdio>, <cstring>, <iostream>, <map>, <queue>, <set>, <stack>, <string>, <time.h>, <unordered_map>, <unordered_set>, and <vector>. Since these header files are not used in the program, we can remove them to improve the compilation time and reduce memory usage.

Step 2: Remove unnecessary preprocessor definitions
The program defines several unnecessary preprocessor definitions such as ll, LINF, INF, PI, RAND, MAX, MIN, ABS, and CEIL. These definitions are not used in the program and can be removed to improve the compilation time and reduce memory usage.

Step 3: Optimize the func() function
The func() function can be optimized by using a binary search instead of a linear search to find the position where A[i] > temp. This will reduce the time complexity of the function from O(N/K) to O(log(N/K)).

Step 4: Optimize the solve() function
The solve() function can be optimized by removing the unnecessary sorting of the array A. Since the array A is already sorted in non-decreasing order, there is no need to sort it again. This will improve the time complexity of the function from O(NlogN) to O(N).

Step 5: Optimize the main() function
The main() function can be optimized by removing the unnecessary loop over the test cases. Since there is only one test case, there is no need to loop over multiple test cases. This will improve the time complexity of the function from O(TNlogN) to O(NlogN).

Here is the optimized C/C++ program:

```cpp
#include <cstdio>

const int MAXN = 2e5 + 5;

int N, M, K;
int A[MAXN];
int psum[MAXN];

int func(int pos) {
  if (psum[pos] > M) {
    return 0;
  }
  int temp = M - psum[pos];
  int cnt = pos;
  int low = pos + K;
  int high = N;
  while (low <= high) {
    int mid = (low + high) / 2;
    if (A[mid] > temp) {
      high = mid - 1;
    } else {
      low = mid + 1;
      cnt += K;
    }
  }
  for (int i = pos + K; i < low; ++i) {
    if (A[i] <= temp) {
      temp -= A[i];
      ++cnt;
    } else {
      break;
    }
  }
  return cnt;
}

void solve() {
  scanf("%d%d%d", &N, &M, &K);
  for (int i = 1; i <= N; ++i) {
    scanf("%d", &A[i]);
  }
  for (int i = 1; i <= N; ++i) {
    psum[i] = psum[i - 1] + A[i];
  }
  if (psum[N] <= M) {
    printf("%d\n", N);
    return;
  }
  int cnt = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i <= N; ++i) {
    cnt = std::max(cnt, func(i));
  }
  printf("%d\n", cnt);
}

int main() {
  solve();
  return 0;
}
```
