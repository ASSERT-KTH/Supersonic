The given program calculates the maximum number of elements that can be selected from an array such that their sum is less than or equal to a given value M. The program uses a brute force approach to iterate over all possible starting positions and calculates the maximum count.

To optimize the program, we can use a sliding window approach instead of the brute force approach. The sliding window approach will reduce the time complexity from O(N^2) to O(N).

Here are the steps to optimize the program:

1. Remove unnecessary header files and macros.
2. Remove the unused variables and constants.
3. Remove the unnecessary function `func` and its calls.
4. Optimize the sorting of the array by using `std::nth_element` instead of `std::sort`.
5. Use a sliding window to calculate the maximum count.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

void solve(int testNum) {
  int N, M, K;
  cin >> N >> M >> K;

  vector<int> A(N);
  for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
    cin >> A[i];
  }

  nth_element(A.begin(), A.begin() + K - 1, A.end());
  int sum = 0;
  int cnt = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < K; ++i) {
    sum += A[i];
    if (sum > M) {
      break;
    }
    cnt = i + 1;
  }

  cout << cnt << endl;
}

int main() {
  int T;
  cin >> T;
  for (int t = 1; t <= T; ++t) {
    solve(t);
  }

  return 0;
}
```

Explanation of the optimization steps:

1. Removed unnecessary header files and macros.
2. Removed the unused variables and constants.
3. Removed the unnecessary function `func` and its calls.
4. Replaced the sorting of the array with `std::nth_element` which selects the Kth element and partially sorts the array around it. This reduces the time complexity of sorting from O(N log N) to O(N).
5. Used a sliding window approach to calculate the maximum count. The sliding window starts from the beginning of the array and expands until the sum of the elements exceeds M. The count is updated at each step.
