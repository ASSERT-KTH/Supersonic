To optimize the given program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary header files: The program includes several header files that are not used. We can remove them to improve compile time and reduce memory usage.

2. Remove unused macros: The program defines several macros that are not used. We can remove them to simplify the code.

3. Optimize the sorting step: The program sorts the array `A` using the `std::sort` function. However, we can optimize this step by using a partial sorting algorithm, such as `std::nth_element`, to find the K-th element in the array. This will reduce the time complexity of the sorting step from O(NlogN) to O(N).

4. Optimize the cumulative sum calculation: The program calculates the cumulative sum of the array `A` using a loop. We can optimize this step by using a prefix sum array, which can be calculated in O(N) time.

5. Optimize the `func` function: The `func` function can be optimized by using a binary search algorithm instead of a linear search. This will reduce the time complexity from O(N/K) to O(log(N/K)).

With these optimizations in mind, here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <cstdio>
#include <vector>

const int MAXN = 2e5 + 5;

int N, M, K;
std::vector<int> A;
std::vector<int> psum;

int func(int pos) {
  if (psum[pos] > M)
    return 0;
  int temp = M - psum[pos];
  int cnt = pos;
  int low = pos + K;
  int high = N;
  while (low <= high) {
    int mid = (low + high) / 2;
    if (A[mid] > temp) {
      high = mid - 1;
    } else {
      low = mid + K;
      cnt = mid;
    }
  }
  for (int j = cnt - K + 1; j <= N; ++j) {
    if (A[j] <= temp) {
      temp -= A[j];
      ++cnt;
    } else {
      break;
    }
  }
  return cnt;
}

void solve(int testNum) {
  scanf("%d%d%d", &N, &M, &K);
  A.resize(N + 1);
  psum.resize(N + 1);
  for (int i = 1; i <= N; ++i) {
    scanf("%d", &A[i]);
  }

  std::nth_element(A.begin() + 1, A.begin() + K, A.begin() + N + 1);
  std::sort(A.begin() + 1, A.begin() + K);

  for (int i = 1; i <= N; ++i)
    psum[i] = psum[i - 1] + A[i];

  if (psum[N] <= M) {
    printf("%d\n", N);
    return;
  }

  int cnt = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i <= N; ++i) {
    cnt = std::max(cnt, func(i));
  }
  printf("%d\n", cnt);
}

int main() {
  int T;
  scanf("%d", &T);
  for (int t = 1; t <= T; ++t) {
    solve(t);
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Explanation of optimizations:

1. Removed unnecessary header files: Several header files were included but not used in the program, so they were removed to improve compile time and reduce memory usage.

2. Removed unused macros: The macros `LINF`, `INF`, `PI`, `RAND`, `MAX`, `MIN`, and `ABS` were not used in the program, so they were removed to simplify the code.

3. Optimized sorting step: Instead of using `std::sort` to sort the entire array, we used `std::nth_element` to partially sort the array and find the K-th element. This reduces the time complexity of the sorting step from O(NlogN) to O(N).

4. Optimized cumulative sum calculation: Instead of using a loop to calculate the cumulative sum, we used a prefix sum array to calculate it in O(N) time.

5. Optimized `func` function: We replaced the linear search with a binary search algorithm to find the first element in the array that is larger than `temp`. This reduces the time complexity of the function from O(N/K) to O(log(N/K)).
