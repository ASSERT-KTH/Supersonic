The given C/C++ program calculates the maximum number of elements that can be selected from an array A such that their sum is less than or equal to a given value M, and the selected elements are at a distance of K positions from each other.

To optimize the program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary header files: The program includes many header files that are not used. We can remove them to reduce unnecessary compilation time and memory usage.

2. Remove unused macros: The program defines several macros that are not used. We can remove them to simplify the code.

3. Remove unnecessary variables: The program defines variables `Q` and `MOD` that are not used. We can remove them.

4. Remove unnecessary calculations: The program calculates the sum of the entire array `A` using the `psum` array. However, we only need to check if the sum of the array is less than or equal to `M`. We can remove the `psum` array and calculate the sum on the fly while traversing the array.

5. Optimize the `func` function: The `func` function calculates the maximum number of elements that can be selected from position `pos`. It can be optimized by using a binary search to find the position `i` where `A[i]` is the largest element that is less than or equal to `temp`, instead of traversing the array from `i` to `N`. This will reduce the time complexity from O(N/K) to O(log(N/K)).

Based on these optimizations, the optimized C/C++ program is as follows:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <cstdio>
using namespace std;

const int MAXN = 2e5 + 5;

int N, M, K;
int A[MAXN];

int func(int pos) {
  if (A[pos] > M)
    return 0;
  int temp = M - A[pos];
  int cnt = pos;
  int low = pos + K;
  int high = N;
  while (low <= high) {
    int mid = (low + high) / 2;
    if (A[mid] <= temp) {
      cnt = mid;
      low = mid + K;
    } else {
      high = mid - 1;
    }
  }
  return cnt;
}

void solve(int testNum) {
  scanf("%d%d%d", &N, &M, &K);
  for (int i = 1; i <= N; ++i) {
    scanf("%d", &A[i]);
  }
  sort(A + 1, A + 1 + N);
  if (A[N] <= M) {
    printf("%d\n", N);
    return;
  }
  int cnt = 0;
  for (int i = 1; i <= N; i += K) {
    cnt = max(cnt, func(i));
  }
  printf("%d\n", cnt);
}

int main() {
  int T;
  scanf("%d", &T);
  while (T--) {
    solve(T);
  }
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized program reduces unnecessary calculations, simplifies the code, and improves the time complexity of the `func` function.
