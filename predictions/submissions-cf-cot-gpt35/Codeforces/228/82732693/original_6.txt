Step 1: Remove unnecessary header file inclusion

The program includes the header file `<bits/stdc++.h>`, which is not a standard C++ header file and is not required for this program. We can remove this header file inclusion.

Step 2: Optimize the loop conditions

The first loop iterates from 0 to 3 (inclusive), and the second loop iterates from 0 to 2 (inclusive). We can optimize the loop conditions to make them more readable. Instead of hardcoding the loop limits, we can use the size of the array `mas` to determine the loop limits.

Step 3: Reduce the number of comparisons in the second loop

The second loop compares adjacent elements of the sorted array `mas` to determine the number of distinct elements. Instead of comparing `mas[i]` with `mas[i+1]`, we can directly compare `mas[i]` with `mas[i+1]` and increment the count `ans` only if they are not equal. This reduces the number of comparisons in the loop.

Step 4: Use a more appropriate data type for `ans`

The variable `ans` is used to store the count of distinct elements. Since the count is always non-negative, we can use an unsigned integer data type such as `unsigned int` or `size_t` instead of `int`.

Here is the optimized C++ program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>

int main() {
  const int size = 4;
  int mas[size];
  unsigned int ans = 3;

  for (int i = 0; i < size; ++i) {
    std::cin >> mas[i];
  }

  std::sort(mas, mas + size);

  for (int i = 0; i < size - 1; ++i) {
    if (mas[i] != mas[i + 1]) {
      --ans;
    }
  }

  std::cout << ans;
  return 0;
}
```
