Step 1: Remove unnecessary includes
The first optimization we can make is to remove the unnecessary include statement. The `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` includes a large number of libraries, which is not needed for this program. We can replace it with the specific libraries that are required.

Step 2: Optimize the loop condition
The second optimization we can make is to optimize the loop condition in the second for loop. Instead of iterating until `i < 3`, we can iterate until `i < 2` because we only need to compare up to the third element with the fourth element.

Step 3: Simplify the logic
The third optimization we can make is to simplify the logic in the second for loop. Instead of decrementing `ans` by 1 when `mas[i] != mas[i + 1]`, we can increment `ans` by 1 when `mas[i] == mas[i + 1]`. This way, we can avoid the need for the `ans` variable to be initialized to 3.

Here is the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int mas[4];
  for (int i = 0; i < 4; ++i) {
    cin >> mas[i];
  }
  sort(mas, mas + 4);
  int ans = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < 2; ++i) {
    if (mas[i] == mas[i + 1])
      ++ans;
  }
  cout << ans;
}
```
