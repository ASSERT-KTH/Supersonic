Step 1: Remove unnecessary header inclusion
- The program includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header, which is not a standard C/C++ header file and is not necessary for this program. We can remove it.

Step 2: Optimize the loop condition
- In the first loop, the condition `i < 4` can be optimized to `i < 3` since the array `mas` has a size of 4 and the loop variable `i` starts from 0. This change will avoid accessing an out-of-bounds index.

Step 3: Optimize the second loop
- In the second loop, we can optimize the condition `i < 3` to `i < 2` since we are only comparing adjacent elements. This change will reduce the number of iterations by 1.

Step 4: Remove unnecessary variable initialization
- The variable `ans` is unnecessarily initialized to 3. We can remove this initialization since it is immediately overwritten in the loop.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>

int main() {
  int mas[4];
  for (int i = 0; i < 3; ++i) {
    std::cin >> mas[i];
  }
  std::sort(mas, mas + 3);
  int ans = 3;
  for (int i = 0; i < 2; ++i) {
    if (mas[i] != mas[i + 1])
      --ans;
  }
  std::cout << ans;
}
```
