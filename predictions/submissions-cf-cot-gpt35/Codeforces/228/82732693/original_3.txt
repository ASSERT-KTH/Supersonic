The given program reads 4 integers from the user, stores them in an array `mas`, sorts the array, and then checks for the number of distinct integers in the array. The count of distinct integers is stored in the variable `ans` and is finally printed.

The program can be optimized in the following steps:

1. Remove the unnecessary include statement `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`. This includes the entire standard library, which is not required for this program.

2. Instead of using a fixed-size array `mas[5]`, use a dynamically allocated array of size 4, since we are only reading 4 integers.

3. Instead of sorting the array, we can use a set to keep track of distinct integers. Sets automatically store unique elements in sorted order.

4. Instead of decrementing `ans` when a non-distinct integer is found, we can initialize `ans` to the size of the set at the beginning and decrement it only when a duplicate integer is found.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_set>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int* mas = new int[4];
  int ans = 3;
  unordered_set<int> distinctIntegers;

  for (int i = 0; i < 4; ++i) {
    cin >> mas[i];
    distinctIntegers.insert(mas[i]);
  }

  ans = distinctIntegers.size();

  cout << ans;

  delete[] mas;
}
```
