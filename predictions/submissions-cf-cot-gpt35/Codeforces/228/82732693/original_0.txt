Step 1: Remove unnecessary includes

The code includes the entire `<bits/stdc++.h>` header, which is not necessary and can slow down the compilation process. We can remove it and only include the necessary headers.

Step 2: Optimize the loop iterations

The loop in the program iterates from 0 to 3, but the array `mas` has a size of 5. Instead of hardcoding the loop condition, we can use the size of the array to make the loop more flexible.

Step 3: Optimize the sorting process

The code uses the `sort` function to sort the `mas` array. However, the array has a fixed size of 4, so we can use a more efficient sorting algorithm such as bubble sort.

Step 4: Optimize the counting process

The code uses a loop to count the number of distinct elements in the sorted array. Instead of using a loop, we can use a set to store the distinct elements and then use the size of the set to determine the count.

Step 5: Remove unused variables

The variable `ans` is only used to store the count of distinct elements and is not necessary. We can directly output the size of the set.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <set>

int main() {
  int mas[4];
  for (int i = 0; i < 4; ++i) {
    std::cin >> mas[i];
  }

  // Bubble sort
  for (int i = 0; i < 3; ++i) {
    for (int j = 0; j < 3 - i; ++j) {
      if (mas[j] > mas[j + 1]) {
        std::swap(mas[j], mas[j + 1]);
      }
    }
  }

  std::set<int> distinctElements;
  for (int i = 0; i < 4; ++i) {
    distinctElements.insert(mas[i]);
  }

  std::cout << distinctElements.size();

  return 0;
}
```
