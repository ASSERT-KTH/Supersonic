The given program reads 4 integers into an array `mas`, sorts the array, and then counts the number of distinct elements in the sorted array. The count is stored in the variable `ans` and then printed.

To optimize this program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Instead of using the `bits/stdc++.h` header, we can include only the necessary headers. In this case, we only need `<iostream>` and `<algorithm>`.
2. We can remove the unused variable `ans` and directly print the count of distinct elements.
3. Instead of using a fixed size array `mas` of size 5, we can use a dynamic array or a `std::vector` to store the input elements. This will allow us to handle any number of input elements.
4. We can optimize the sorting algorithm by using `std::sort` which has an average time complexity of O(n log n).
5. Instead of checking for distinct elements using a loop, we can use `std::unique` along with `std::distance` to determine the count of distinct elements in a more efficient way.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>
#include <vector>

int main() {
  std::vector<int> mas;
  for (int i = 0; i < 4; ++i) {
    int num;
    std::cin >> num;
    mas.push_back(num);
  }
  
  std::sort(mas.begin(), mas.end());
  
  int count = std::distance(mas.begin(), std::unique(mas.begin(), mas.end()));
  std::cout << count;
}
```
