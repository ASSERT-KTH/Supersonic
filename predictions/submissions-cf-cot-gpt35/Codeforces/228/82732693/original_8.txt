Explanation of the optimization steps:

1. Remove unnecessary header file inclusion: The program includes the header file `<bits/stdc++.h>`, which is not a standard header file and is not required for this program. We can remove this line.

2. Remove unused variable: The variable `ans` is initialized to 3 at the beginning but is not used until the end of the program. We can remove this variable and directly output the count instead.

3. Use a constant for array size: The array `mas` has a fixed size of 5, but the program only reads and sorts the first 4 elements. We can use a constant value for the array size to make the program more clear.

4. Use `std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false)` before `cin` and `cout`: By default, standard input and output streams are synchronized with their corresponding C library streams, which can be inefficient. By disabling this synchronization, we can improve the program's runtime.

5. Use a faster sorting algorithm: The program currently uses `std::sort` to sort the array. However, for small arrays like this, a faster sorting algorithm such as insertion sort can be used.

Optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

const int ARRAY_SIZE = 4;

int main() {
  int mas[ARRAY_SIZE];
  for (int i = 0; i < ARRAY_SIZE; ++i) {
    cin >> mas[i];
  }

  // Disable synchronization with C library streams
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);

  // Use insertion sort for small arrays
  for (int i = 1; i < ARRAY_SIZE; ++i) {
    int key = mas[i];
    int j = i - 1;
    while (j >= 0 && mas[j] > key) {
      mas[j + 1] = mas[j];
      --j;
    }
    mas[j + 1] = key;
  }

  int count = ARRAY_SIZE;
  for (int i = 0; i < ARRAY_SIZE - 1; ++i) {
    if (mas[i] == mas[i + 1]) {
      --count;
    }
  }

  cout << count;

  return 0;
}
```
