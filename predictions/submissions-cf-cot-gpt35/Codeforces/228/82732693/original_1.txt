Step 1: Remove unnecessary header file

The program includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header file, which is not necessary. We can remove it.

Step 2: Optimize the loop condition

In the first loop, the condition `i < 4` is used. However, the array `mas` has a size of 5. Changing the loop condition to `i < 5` will prevent accessing out of bounds of the array.

Step 3: Optimize the second loop condition

In the second loop, the condition `i < 3` is used. However, the loop only iterates 3 times. Changing the loop condition to `i < 4` will prevent unnecessary iterations.

Step 4: Remove unnecessary variable initialization

The variable `ans` is initialized with the value 3, but it is immediately overwritten in the loop. We can remove the initialization.

Step 5: Optimize the loop logic

In the second loop, the program checks if `mas[i]` is not equal to `mas[i + 1]` and then decrements `ans`. This can be optimized by checking if `mas[i]` is equal to `mas[i + 1]` and incrementing a counter variable. After the loop, we can subtract the counter variable from 3 to get the final value of `ans`.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>

int main() {
  int mas[5];
  for (int i = 0; i < 5; ++i) {
    std::cin >> mas[i];
  }
  std::sort(mas, mas + 5);
  
  int counter = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < 4; ++i) {
    if (mas[i] == mas[i + 1])
      ++counter;
  }
  int ans = 3 - counter;
  
  std::cout << ans;
}
```
