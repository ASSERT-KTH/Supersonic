Step 1: Remove unnecessary header files.

The program includes `<iostream>` and `<vector>` header files, but they are not used in the program. We can remove them to improve the program's compilation time and reduce memory usage.

Step 2: Replace `using namespace std;` with specific using statements.

Using `using namespace std;` brings all the names from the `std` namespace into the global namespace, which can cause naming conflicts. Instead, we can use specific using statements for the names we need, such as `using std::map` and `using std::sort`.

Step 3: Replace `scanf` and `printf` with `cin` and `cout`.

The program uses `scanf` and `printf` for input and output respectively. However, `cin` and `cout` from the `<iostream>` library are more type-safe and provide better error handling. We can replace `scanf` and `printf` with `cin` and `cout` to improve the program's readability and maintainability.

Step 4: Optimize the sorting algorithm.

The program uses the `sort` function from the `<algorithm>` library to sort the array in descending order. However, the `greater<int>()` comparator is unnecessary because sorting in descending order is the default behavior of `sort` when no comparator is provided. We can remove the `greater<int>()` comparator to simplify the code.

Step 5: Optimize the map operations.

The program uses a map `x` to store the number of remaining weights. In each iteration, it searches for the best weight by iterating over all elements in the map. This can be optimized by using a `std::multiset` instead of a map. The `std::multiset` automatically sorts the elements in ascending order and allows duplicates. We can replace the map operations with multiset operations to improve the program's efficiency.

Step 6: Modify the code according to the optimizations.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <set>

int main() {
  int n_sets;
  std::cin >> n_sets;
  for (int set_number = 1; set_number <= n_sets; set_number++) {
    int n, W;
    std::cin >> n >> W;
    int a[n];
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
      std::cin >> a[i];
    std::sort(a, a + n);
    std::multiset<int> x;
    x.insert(W);
    for (int i : a) {
      int remain = W - i;
      auto it = x.lower_bound(remain);
      if (it != x.end()) {
        x.erase(it);
        x.insert(remain);
      }
    }
    std::cout << x.size() << std::endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```
