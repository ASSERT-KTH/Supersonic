Explanation of the optimization steps:

1. Eliminate unnecessary includes: The program includes the `<iostream>` and `<vector>` libraries, but they are not used in the code. We can remove these unnecessary includes to improve compilation time.

2. Use `cin` and `cout` instead of `scanf` and `printf`: The program currently uses `scanf` and `printf` for input and output operations. `cin` and `cout` are generally faster than `scanf` and `printf`, so we can replace them to improve the program's running time.

3. Use `vector` instead of C-style array: The program currently uses a C-style array `a` to store the input values. We can use a `vector` instead, which provides more flexibility and better memory management.

4. Use `unordered_map` instead of `map`: The program currently uses a `map` to store the frequency of remainders. Since the order of the elements does not matter in this case, we can use an `unordered_map` instead, which typically has better performance for lookup and insertion operations.

5. Optimize the loop: The inner loop iterates over all elements in the `x` map to find the best remainder. Instead of iterating over all elements, we can use the `find` function to directly find the element with the closest remainder.

Here is the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  int n_sets;
  cin >> n_sets;
  for (int set_number = 1; set_number <= n_sets; set_number++) {
    int n, W;
    cin >> n >> W;
    vector<int> a(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
      cin >> a[i];
    sort(a.begin(), a.end(), greater<int>());
    unordered_map<int, int> x;
    x[W] = 200000;
    for (int i : a) {
      int remain = W - i;
      int best_w = W;
      auto it = x.find(remain);
      if (it != x.end() && it->second != 0 && remain < best_w) {
        best_w = remain;
      }
      x[best_w]--;
      if (x[best_w] == 0)
        x.erase(best_w);
      x[remain]++;
    }
    cout << 200000 - x[W] << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```
