To optimize the given program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Replace the usage of `scanf` and `printf` with `cin` and `cout` respectively. This will improve the I/O performance.

2. Use a `vector` instead of an array `a` to store the input elements. This will allow us to dynamically resize the vector based on the number of elements.

3. Instead of using a `map` to keep track of the counts of remainders, we can use an array. Since the remainders are non-negative integers, we can create an array of size `W+1` to represent the counts. This will reduce the memory usage and improve the performance.

4. Instead of using a range-based for loop to iterate over the elements of `a`, we can use a traditional for loop. This will improve the performance slightly.

5. Instead of using an iterator to iterate over the elements of `x` in the inner loop, we can use a traditional for loop with an index. This will improve the performance slightly.

6. Instead of erasing the element from `x` using `x.erase`, we can directly set the count to zero. This will improve the performance.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int n_sets;
  cin >> n_sets;
  
  for (int set_number = 1; set_number <= n_sets; set_number++) {
    int n, W;
    cin >> n >> W;
    
    vector<int> a(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
      cin >> a[i];
    
    sort(a.begin(), a.end(), greater<int>());
    
    vector<int> x(W+1, 0);
    x[W] = 200000;
    
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      int remain = W - a[i];
      int best_w = W;
      
      for (int j = 0; j <= W; j++) {
        if (j - a[i] >= 0 && x[j] != 0 && j - a[i] < remain) {
          best_w = j;
          remain = j - a[i];
        }
      }
      
      x[best_w]--;
      x[remain]++;
    }
    
    cout << 200000 - x[W] << endl;
  }
  
  return 0;
}
```

These modifications should significantly improve the running time and memory usage of the program.
