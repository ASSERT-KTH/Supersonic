This program calculates the number of different ways we can form a total weight W using a given set of weights. The program takes the number of test sets as input, followed by each test set consisting of the number of weights and the total weight W, followed by the weights themselves.

To optimize this program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary headers: The `<iostream>` header is not needed as we are using `scanf` and `printf` for input and output. Similarly, the `<vector>` header is not needed as we are not using any vectors.

2. Avoid using `namespace std`: Instead of using `using namespace std`, we can use the `std::` prefix to explicitly specify the standard namespace for the required functions and objects.

3. Use `cin` and `cout` for input and output: Instead of using `scanf` and `printf`, we can use `cin` and `cout` for input and output. This can provide better performance and readability.

4. Use a `unordered_map` instead of a `map`: Since we are only interested in the number of occurrences of each weight, and not their order, we can use an `unordered_map` instead of a `map`. This can provide faster lookup and insertion times.

5. Avoid creating an array for weights: Instead of creating an array `a` to store the weights, we can directly read the weights into a variable `weight` in each iteration of the loop. This can save memory and avoid unnecessary array operations.

6. Use `auto` for the range-based `for` loop: Instead of using `int i : a`, we can use `auto i : a` to automatically deduce the type of `i` based on the type of `a`.

7. Remove unnecessary check for `v != 0`: Since we are only interested in weights that are present in the map, we don't need to check if `v` is non-zero before updating it.

8. Avoid unnecessary erasing and reinserting of elements in the map: Instead of erasing an element from the map and then reinserting it with a different value, we can directly update the value of the existing element.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <utility>

int main() {
  int n_sets;
  std::cin >> n_sets;
  for (int set_number = 1; set_number <= n_sets; set_number++) {
    int n, W;
    std::cin >> n >> W;
    std::unordered_map<int, int> x;
    x[W] = 200000;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      int weight;
      std::cin >> weight;
      int remain = W - weight;
      int best_w = W;
      for (auto& kv : x) {
        int k = kv.first;
        int& v = kv.second;
        if (k - weight >= 0 && k - weight < remain) {
          best_w = k;
          remain = k - weight;
        }
      }
      x[best_w]--;
      x[remain]++;
    }
    std::cout << 200000 - x[W] << std::endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```

These optimizations should improve the performance and memory usage of the program.
