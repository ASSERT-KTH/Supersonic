To optimize the given program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The program includes the entire `<bits/stdc++.h>` library, which is not recommended as it can increase compile time and memory usage. We can remove this include and only include the necessary headers.

2. Remove unnecessary macros: The program defines several macros (`FAST`, `vl`, `pb`, `mp`, `all`, `int32_t`) that are not used. We can remove these macros to simplify the code.

3. Remove unused variables: The program declares two global variables `i` and `j` that are not used. We can remove these variables to improve readability.

4. Simplify the logic: The logic inside the while loop can be simplified to reduce the number of if-else statements. We can calculate the result directly based on the values of `n` and `k`. 

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0);
  cin.tie(0);
  cout.tie(0);

#ifndef ONLINE_JUDGE
  freopen("input.txt", "r", stdin);
  freopen("output.txt", "w", stdout);
#endif

  int t = 1;
  while (t--) {
    int n, k;
    cin >> n >> k;

    int result;
    if (n % 2 == 0) {
      result = 2 * min(k, n / 2);
    } else {
      result = 2 * min(k, (n / 2) + 1) - 1;
    }

    cout << result << endl;
  }

  return 0;
}
```

Explanation of the optimization steps:

1. I removed the unnecessary includes and only included `<iostream>`. This is the standard library for input/output operations in C++.

2. I removed the unused macros to simplify the code.

3. I removed the unused variables `i` and `j` for better readability.

4. I simplified the logic inside the while loop. Instead of using nested if-else statements, I directly calculate the result based on the values of `n` and `k`. This reduces the number of comparisons and makes the code more concise.
