To optimize the given C/C++ program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary header file inclusion: The `bits/stdc++.h` header file includes a large number of standard library headers, which can slow down compilation time. Instead, we can include only the necessary headers for this program.

2. Remove unnecessary macros: The macros `vl`, `pb`, `mp`, `all`, and `int` are not used in the program. We can remove them to simplify the code.

3. Remove unused variables: The variables `i` and `j` are declared but not used in the program. We can remove them to improve readability.

4. Optimize the calculation of the output: The calculation of the output can be simplified to reduce the number of operations. Instead of using multiple conditional statements, we can use a single formula to calculate the output.

5. Remove unnecessary file input/output: The program includes code to read input from a file and write output to a file. This is not necessary for this task, so we can remove this code to improve efficiency.

Here is the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(NULL);
    cout.tie(NULL);

    int t = 1;
    while (t--) {
        int n, k;
        cin >> n >> k;
        int output;
        if (n & 1) {
            output = 2 * min(k, (n / 2) + 1) - 1;
        } else {
            output = 2 * min(k, n / 2);
        }
        cout << output << endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
```

Explanation of the optimization steps:

1. We removed the `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` header file inclusion and included only `<iostream>` instead.

2. We removed the unnecessary macros `vl`, `pb`, `mp`, `all`, and `int`.

3. We removed the unused variables `i` and `j`.

4. We simplified the calculation of the output using a single formula. Instead of using multiple conditional statements, we use `min()` function to calculate the minimum value between `k` and the corresponding limit.

5. We removed the unnecessary file input/output code to focus on optimizing the core logic of the program.
