To optimize the given program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The program includes the entire "bits/stdc++.h" library, which is not recommended as it includes a large number of headers. We can remove this line and only include the necessary headers.

2. Remove unused macros: The macros defined in the program are not used. We can remove them.

3. Remove unused variables: The variables 'i' and 'j' are declared but not used. We can remove them.

4. Remove unnecessary file I/O operations: The program opens and closes input/output files, but these operations are not necessary. We can remove the file I/O related code.

5. Simplify the logic: The logic to calculate the output can be simplified. Instead of using multiple if-else conditions, we can directly calculate the output using a single formula.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(NULL);
    cout.tie(NULL);

    int t = 1;
    while (t--) {
        int n, k;
        cin >> n >> k;

        int result;
        if (n % 2 == 0) {
            result = 2 * k - 1 + (k > n/2);
        } else {
            result = 2 * k - 1 + (k > (n+1)/2);
        }

        cout << result << endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

Explanation of the optimization steps:

1. We remove the unnecessary includes and only include <iostream> which is required for input/output operations.

2. We remove the unused macros defined in the original code.

3. We remove the unused variables 'i' and 'j'.

4. We remove the file I/O related code as it is not necessary for the optimization of the program.

5. We simplify the logic to calculate the output by using a single formula. The formula calculates the result based on the values of 'n' and 'k'. The formula is derived by observing the patterns in the original if-else conditions.
