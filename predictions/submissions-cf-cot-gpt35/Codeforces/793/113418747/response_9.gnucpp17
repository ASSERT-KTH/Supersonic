Step 1: Remove unnecessary header file inclusion

The program includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header file, which is not required for this program. We can remove this line to improve compilation time and reduce memory usage.

Step 2: Optimize nested loops

The program uses nested loops to iterate over the arrays `c[][]` and `f[][][][]`. However, these loops can be optimized by reducing the number of iterations.

In the first nested loop, where `c[][]` is initialized, the loop variables `i` and `j` start from 1 and iterate up to `n`, which results in unnecessary iterations. We can change the loop variables to start from 0 and iterate up to `n - 1` to match the array indices.

In the second nested loop, where `f[][][][]` is initialized, the loop variables `i`, `j`, and `k` start from 1 and iterate up to `n`, `n`, and `p`, respectively. However, the loop variable `k` is only used to access the `f[][][][1]` dimension, so we can reduce the number of iterations by iterating `k` from 0 to `p`.

In the third nested loop, we can optimize the loop bounds by changing the loop variable `d` to iterate from 0 to `n - 1`. This will reduce the number of unnecessary iterations.

Step 3: Optimize unnecessary calculations

The program calculates the minimum value of `f[][][][0]` and `f[][][][1]` for all `i` and `j` in the final loop. However, since `f[][][][0]` and `f[][][][1]` are updated in the previous nested loops, we can directly access these values without the need for the final loop. This will eliminate unnecessary calculations and improve the running time.
