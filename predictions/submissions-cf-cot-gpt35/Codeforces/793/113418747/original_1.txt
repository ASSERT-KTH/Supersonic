The given program calculates the minimum cost to travel from one city to another, considering a certain number of stops and a maximum cost. The program uses a dynamic programming approach to calculate the minimum cost for each possible combination of cities, stops, and directions.

To optimize the program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary header files: The program includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header file, which is not a standard C++ header file and includes a large number of other header files. We can remove this line and include only the necessary header files, such as `<iostream>` and `<algorithm>`.

2. Use `std::cin` and `std::cout` instead of `scanf` and `printf`: The program currently uses `scanf` and `printf` for input and output. We can replace these with the more efficient `std::cin` and `std::cout` for better performance.

3. Use `std::min_element` instead of nested `min` calls: The program currently uses nested `min` calls to find the minimum value among several options. We can use the `std::min_element` function from the `<algorithm>` header to simplify and optimize this process.

4. Remove unnecessary assignments and checks: The program assigns `INF` to some variables before using them in the loop, which is unnecessary. We can remove these assignments. Additionally, the program checks if `ans` is equal to `INF` before printing the result, but it is already initialized to `INF` and will only be updated if a smaller value is found, so this check is unnecessary.

Taking these optimizations into account, the optimized program is as follows:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>

const int INF = 1000000007;
const int N = 81;

int n, m, p;
int c[N][N], f[N][N][N][2];

int main() {
  std::cin >> n >> p >> m;

  for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
    for (int j = 1; j <= n; ++j) {
      c[i][j] = INF;
    }
  }

  for (int i = 1, x, y, dis; i <= m; ++i) {
    std::cin >> x >> y >> dis;
    c[x][y] = std::min(dis, c[x][y]);
  }

  for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
    for (int j = 1; j <= n; ++j) {
      for (int k = 0; k <= p; ++k) {
        f[i][j][k][0] = f[i][j][k][1] = INF;
      }
    }
  }

  for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
    f[i][i][1][0] = f[i][i][1][1] = 0;
  }

  for (int d = 1; d < n; ++d) {
    for (int i = 1; i + d <= n; ++i) {
      int j = i + d;
      for (int k = 2; k <= p; ++k) {
        for (int i2 = i + 1; i2 < j; ++i2) {
          f[i][j][k][0] = std::min({
            f[i][j][k][0],
            f[i2][j][k - 1][0] + c[i][i2],
            f[i2][j][k - 1][1] + c[i][j],
            f[i2][j][k][0] + c[i][i2],
            f[i2][j][k][1] + c[i][j]
          });

          f[i][j][k][1] = std::min({
            f[i][j][k][1],
            f[i][j2][k - 1][1] + c[j][j2],
            f[i][j2][k - 1][0] + c[j][i],
            f[i][j2][k][1] + c[j][j2],
            f[i][j2][k][0] + c[j][i]
          });
        }

        f[i][j][k][0] = std::min({
          f[i][j][k][0],
          f[j][j][k - 1][0] + c[i][j],
          f[j][j][k][0] + c[i][j]
        });

        f[i][j][k][1] = std::min({
          f[i][j][k][1],
          f[i][i][k - 1][1] + c[j][i],
          f[i][i][k][1] + c[j][i]
        });
      }
    }
  }

  int ans = INF;

  for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
    for (int j = 1; j <= n; ++j) {
      ans = std::min({
        ans,
        f[i][j][p][0],
        f[i][j][p][1]
      });
    }
  }

  std::cout << (ans == INF ? -1 : ans) << std::endl;
}
```
