The given program uses a dynamic programming approach to solve a problem. The program calculates the minimum cost to travel from one node to another node within a graph, with certain constraints.

To optimize this program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary header files: The program includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header file, which is not necessary. We can remove it.

2. Use `cin` and `cout` instead of `scanf` and `printf`: The program uses `scanf` and `printf` for input and output operations. However, `cin` and `cout` are generally faster than `scanf` and `printf` in C++. We can modify the program to use `cin` and `cout` instead.

3. Use a constant for `INF` value: The program uses `INF` as a constant for an infinitely large value. Instead of using `1000000007` as the value of `INF`, we can define a constant for it.

4. Optimize the nested loops: The program has multiple nested loops, which can be optimized by reducing unnecessary iterations. We can modify the loops to iterate only up to the required range.

5. Remove unnecessary variable initializations: The program initializes some variables unnecessarily. We can remove these initializations to improve performance.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

const int INF = 1e9 + 7;

int main() {
  int n, m, p;
  cin >> n >> p >> m;

  vector<vector<int>> c(n + 1, vector<int>(n + 1, INF));
  for (int i = 1, x, y, dis; i <= m; ++i) {
    cin >> x >> y >> dis;
    c[x][y] = min(dis, c[x][y]);
  }

  vector<vector<vector<vector<int>>>> f(n + 1, vector<vector<vector<int>>>(n + 1, vector<vector<int>>(p + 1, vector<int>(2, INF))));
  
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
    f[i][i][1][0] = f[i][i][1][1] = 0;
  }

  for (int d = 1; d < n; ++d) {
    for (int i = 1; i + d <= n; ++i) {
      int j = i + d;
      for (int k = 2; k <= p; ++k) {
        for (int i2 = i + 1; i2 < j; ++i2) {
          f[i][j][k][0] = min(f[i][j][k][0], f[i2][j][k - 1][0] + c[i][i2]);
          f[i][j][k][0] = min(f[i][j][k][0], f[i2][j][k - 1][1] + c[i][j]);
          f[i][j][k][0] = min(f[i][j][k][0], f[i2][j][k][0] + c[i][i2]);
          f[i][j][k][0] = min(f[i][j][k][0], f[i2][j][k][1] + c[i][j]);
        }
        f[i][j][k][0] = min(f[i][j][k][0], f[j][j][k - 1][0] + c[i][j]);
        f[i][j][k][0] = min(f[i][j][k][0], f[j][j][k][0] + c[i][j]);
        for (int j2 = j - 1; j2 > i; --j2) {
          f[i][j][k][1] = min(f[i][j][k][1], f[i][j2][k - 1][1] + c[j][j2]);
          f[i][j][k][1] = min(f[i][j][k][1], f[i][j2][k - 1][0] + c[j][i]);
          f[i][j][k][1] = min(f[i][j][k][1], f[i][j2][k][1] + c[j][j2]);
          f[i][j][k][1] = min(f[i][j][k][1], f[i][j2][k][0] + c[j][i]);
        }
        f[i][j][k][1] = min(f[i][j][k][1], f[i][i][k - 1][1] + c[j][i]);
        f[i][j][k][1] = min(f[i][j][k][1], f[i][i][k][1] + c[j][i]);
      }
    }
  }

  int ans = INF;
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
    for (int j = 1; j <= n; ++j) {
      ans = min(ans, f[i][j][p][0]);
      ans = min(ans, f[i][j][p][1]);
    }
  }
  
  cout << (ans == INF ? -1 : ans) << endl;
}
```

Explanation of optimizations:
1. Removed unnecessary header files.
2. Modified input and output operations to use `cin` and `cout`.
3. Defined `INF` as a constant for an infinitely large value.
4. Optimized nested loops by reducing unnecessary iterations.
5. Removed unnecessary variable initializations.
