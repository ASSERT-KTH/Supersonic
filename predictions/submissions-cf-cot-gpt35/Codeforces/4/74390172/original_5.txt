Step 1: Remove unnecessary headers

The program includes the header `<bits/stdc++.h>`, which includes a lot of other headers. This can slow down the compilation process and increase memory usage. We can remove this header and only include the necessary headers: `<iostream>`, `<string>`, and `<unordered_map>`.

Step 2: Remove unnecessary type definitions

The program defines typedefs for `ll`, `ull`, and `ld`, which are not used in the program. We can remove these typedefs.

Step 3: Remove unnecessary macros

The program defines macros for `endl` and `FASTER`, which are not used in the program. We can remove these macros.

Step 4: Remove unnecessary constants

The program defines constants for `POSITIVE_INFINITY`, `NEGATIVE_INFINITY`, `MOD`, and `PI`, which are not used in the program. We can remove these constants.

Step 5: Optimize unordered_map

The program uses an `unordered_map` to store the frequency of strings. We can optimize the `unordered_map` by reserving an initial capacity and setting a lower maximum load factor. This can reduce memory usage and improve performance.

Step 6: Avoid unnecessary string copies

The program currently reads strings into a temporary variable `ar` and then copies the string into the `unordered_map`. We can avoid this unnecessary string copy by directly inserting the string into the `unordered_map`.

Step 7: Avoid unnecessary map lookups

The program currently performs a map lookup to check if a string is already in the `unordered_map`. We can avoid this unnecessary lookup by using the `unordered_map`'s `insert` function, which returns a pair of an iterator and a boolean indicating whether the insertion was successful or not.

Step 8: Avoid unnecessary map lookups

The program currently performs a map lookup to retrieve the frequency of a string and then increments it. We can avoid this unnecessary lookup by using the iterator returned by the `insert` function to directly access the frequency and increment it.

Here is the optimized C++ program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <unordered_map>
using namespace std;

const int N = 200005;

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  cout.tie(NULL);

  int n;
  cin >> n;

  unordered_map<string, int> mp;
  mp.reserve(1 << 18);
  mp.max_load_factor(0.25);

  while (n--) {
    string ar;
    cin >> ar;
    
    auto [it, success] = mp.insert({ar, 0});

    if (success) {
      cout << "OK\n";
    } else {
      cout << ar << it->second << "\n";
      it->second++;
    }
  }

  return 0;
}
```
