To optimize the given program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary headers: The program includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header, which is not required for this program. We can remove it.

2. Remove unnecessary typedefs: The program defines typedefs for `ll`, `ull`, and `ld` which are not used in the program. We can remove these typedefs.

3. Remove unnecessary macros: The program defines macros for `endl`, `FASTER`, `POSITIVE_INFINITY`, `NEGATIVE_INFINITY`, `MOD`, and `PI` which are not used in the program. We can remove these macros.

4. Remove unnecessary template functions: The program defines template functions `bigMod` and `invMod`, which are not used in the program. We can remove these template functions.

5. Use `reserve` and `max_load_factor` for unordered_map: The program uses an unordered_map to store strings and their counts. We can optimize the unordered_map by reserving memory using `reserve` and setting a lower `max_load_factor`.

After making these optimizations, the optimized program is as follows:
