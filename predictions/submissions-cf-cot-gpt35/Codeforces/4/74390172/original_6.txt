The original program has a few areas that can be optimized:

1. Unnecessary includes: The program includes the entire `bits/stdc++.h` header, which is not necessary for this program. We can remove it and only include the necessary headers.

2. Unnecessary type definitions: The program defines `ll`, `ull`, and `ld` types, but these types are not used in the program. We can remove these type definitions.

3. Unnecessary preprocessor directives: The program defines `endl` and `FASTER` as preprocessor directives, but these are not used in the program. We can remove these definitions.

4. Unnecessary constant definitions: The program defines `POSITIVE_INFINITY`, `NEGATIVE_INFINITY`, `MOD`, and `PI` constants, but these are not used in the program. We can remove these constant definitions.

5. Unnecessary template functions: The program defines `bigMod` and `invMod` template functions, but these are not used in the program. We can remove these function definitions.

6. Unnecessary container reservation and load factor modification: The program reserves space for the `unordered_map` and modifies its load factor, but these optimizations are not necessary for this program. We can remove these optimizations.

7. Unnecessary use of `auto` keyword: The program uses the `auto` keyword to define the iterator `it`, but the type of the iterator can be explicitly defined as `unordered_map<string, int>::iterator`.

8. Unnecessary check for element existence in `unordered_map`: The program checks if an element exists in the `unordered_map` using `find` function, but we can directly access the element using the subscript operator `[]` and check if the value is zero.

Based on these optimizations, here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <string>

int main() {
  std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  std::cin.tie(NULL);
  std::cout.tie(NULL);

  int n;
  std::cin >> n;

  std::unordered_map<std::string, int> mp;
  while (n--) {
    std::string ar;
    std::cin >> ar;

    int& count = mp[ar];
    if (count == 0) {
      std::cout << "OK\n";
      count = 1;
    } else {
      std::cout << ar << count << "\n";
      count++;
    }
  }

  return 0;
}
```
