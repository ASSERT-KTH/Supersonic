The given program has a few areas that can be optimized:

1. Removing unnecessary headers: The program includes `<bits/stdc++.h>`, which is not a standard C++ header and includes a large number of unnecessary headers. We can remove this and include only the necessary headers.

2. Removing unnecessary typedefs: The program includes typedefs for `ll`, `ull` and `ld` which are not used. We can remove these typedefs.

3. Removing unnecessary defines: The program defines `FASTER`, `POSITIVE_INFINITY`, `NEGATIVE_INFINITY`, `MOD` and `PI` which are not used. We can remove these defines.

4. Optimizing the unordered_map: The program creates an unordered_map and reserves a large amount of space using `mp.reserve(1 << 18)`. However, this is not necessary as the number of elements in the map is not known in advance. We can remove this line.

5. Optimizing the unordered_map load factor: The program sets the maximum load factor of the unordered_map to 0.25 using `mp.max_load_factor(0.25)`. This is not necessary as the default load factor is already optimized. We can remove this line.

6. Optimizing the unordered_map find operation: The program uses `mp.find(ar)` to find an element in the unordered_map. However, this can be optimized by using `mp[ar]` directly and checking if the value is 0 or non-zero. If the value is 0, it means the element is not present in the map and we can output "OK" and set the value to 1. If the value is non-zero, it means the element is already present in the map and we can output the element followed by its value and increment the value.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  cout.tie(NULL);

  int n;
  cin >> n;

  unordered_map<string, int> mp;

  while (n--) {
    string ar;
    cin >> ar;
    if (mp[ar] == 0) {
      cout << "OK\n";
      mp[ar] = 1;
    } else {
      cout << ar << mp[ar] << "\n";
      mp[ar]++;
    }
  }

  return 0;
}
```
