The given program seems to be a program that reads a list of strings and checks if each string has been encountered before. If a string has been encountered before, it appends a number to the string to make it unique. If a string has not been encountered before, it prints "OK" and adds it to the map.

To optimize the program, we can make the following changes:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The program includes the entire `<bits/stdc++.h>` library, which is not recommended. We can remove this line and only include the necessary headers.

2. Remove unnecessary typedefs: The program typedefs `ll`, `ull`, and `ld`, but they are not used anywhere in the code. We can remove these typedefs.

3. Remove unnecessary constants: The program defines `POSITIVE_INFINITY`, `NEGATIVE_INFINITY`, `MOD`, and `PI` constants, but they are not used anywhere in the code. We can remove these constants.

4. Remove unnecessary functions: The program defines `bigMod` and `invMod` functions, but they are not used anywhere in the code. We can remove these functions.

5. Use `'\n'` instead of `endl`: The program uses `endl` to end each line, but `endl` flushes the output buffer, which can be costly in terms of performance. We can use `'\n'` instead, which only inserts a newline character.

6. Use a reserve and max_load_factor for the unordered_map: The program calls `mp.reserve(1 << 18)` and `mp.max_load_factor(0.25)` to optimize the unordered_map. This can help reduce the number of rehashing operations and improve performance.

7. Use emplace instead of insert: The program uses `mp[ar] = 1` to add a new element to the unordered_map. We can use `mp.emplace(ar, 1)` instead, which can be more efficient as it constructs the element in-place.

8. Use a reference in the loop: The program uses `auto it = mp.find(ar)` to find an element in the unordered_map. We can use `auto& it = mp.find(ar)` instead, which avoids unnecessary copying of the iterator.

9. Use prefix increment instead of postfix increment: The program uses `it->second++` to increment the value of an element in the unordered_map. We can use `++it->second` instead, which can be more efficient as it avoids creating a temporary object.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <unordered_map>

#define FASTER ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); cin.tie(NULL); cout.tie(NULL);

int main() {
  FASTER;
  int n;
  std::cin >> n;
  std::unordered_map<std::string, int> mp;
  mp.reserve(1 << 18);
  mp.max_load_factor(0.25);
  while (n--) {
    std::string ar;
    std::cin >> ar;
    auto& it = mp.find(ar);
    if (it == mp.end()) {
      std::cout << "OK\n";
      mp.emplace(ar, 1);
    } else {
      std::cout << ar << ++it->second << "\n";
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```
