The given program is a C++ program that takes input an integer `n` followed by `n` strings. For each string, it checks if it has occurred before and if not, it outputs "OK" and adds it to a map. If it has occurred before, it outputs the string followed by the count of its occurrences and increments the count.

To optimize the program for running time and memory usage, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary headers: The program includes `<bits/stdc++.h>` which is a non-standard header that includes all standard headers. We can remove it and include only the necessary headers.

2. Remove unnecessary type definitions: The program defines several type aliases (`ll`, `ull`, `ld`) that are not used. We can remove them.

3. Remove unnecessary macros: The program defines macros for `endl` and `FASTER` which are not used. We can remove them.

4. Use `'\n'` instead of `endl`: The program uses `endl` to print a newline character, which flushes the output stream. This can be replaced with `'\n'` for better performance.

5. Avoid unnecessary calculations: The program calculates constants like `POSITIVE_INFINITY`, `NEGATIVE_INFINITY`, `MOD`, and `PI` which are not used. We can remove these calculations.

6. Remove unnecessary template functions: The program defines two template functions `bigMod` and `invMod` which are not used. We can remove them.

7. Use `reserve` and `max_load_factor` for unordered_map: The program uses an `unordered_map` to store string counts. We can improve the performance by reserving memory for a certain number of elements using `reserve` and setting a lower `max_load_factor` to reduce memory usage.

8. Avoid unnecessary map lookups: The program uses `mp.find` to check if a string is already present in the map. Instead, we can directly access the map using `mp[ar]` and check if the value is zero to determine if the string is new or not.

9. Use pre-increment instead of post-increment: The program uses post-increment `it->second++` to increment the count of a string. We can use pre-increment `++it->second` for better performance.

Here is the optimized C++ program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <unordered_map>

int main() {
  std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  std::cin.tie(NULL);
  std::cout.tie(NULL);

  int n;
  std::cin >> n;

  std::unordered_map<std::string, int> mp;
  mp.reserve(n);
  mp.max_load_factor(0.25);

  while (n--) {
    std::string ar;
    std::cin >> ar;

    if (mp[ar] == 0) {
      std::cout << "OK\n";
    } else {
      std::cout << ar << mp[ar] << "\n";
    }
    ++mp[ar];
  }

  return 0;
}
```

This optimized program will have improved running time and reduced memory usage compared to the original program.
