The given program reads a number n from the user, followed by n strings. For each string, it checks if it exists in a map called db. If it doesn't exist, it prints "OK" and adds the string to the map. If it exists, it prints the string followed by its occurrence count in the map.

To optimize this program, we can make the following changes:

1. Remove unnecessary include statements: The program includes the <algorithm> header, but there are no functions from this header used in the program. We can remove this include statement to improve compilation time and reduce memory usage.

2. Replace the map with an unordered_map: The map container in C++ is implemented as a balanced binary search tree, which has a time complexity of O(log n) for insertion and search operations. We can use the unordered_map container instead, which is implemented as a hash table and has an average time complexity of O(1) for insertion and search operations.

3. Reserve space in the unordered_map: Before entering the loop, we can reserve space in the unordered_map to avoid frequent reallocations and improve performance.

4. Disable synchronization with C I/O functions: The program calls `ios::sync_with_stdio(0)` to disable synchronization between the C++ and C I/O streams. However, since we are not using any C I/O functions in this program, we can remove this line for simplicity.

Here's the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  unordered_map<string, int> db;
  db.reserve(n); // Reserve space in the unordered_map

  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    string s;
    cin >> s;
    if (db.find(s) == db.end()) {
      cout << "OK" << '\n';
      db[s] = 1;
    } else {
      cout << s << db[s]++ << '\n';
    }
  }

  return 0;
}
```
