The given program reads a number `n` and a string `s` from the input. It then maintains a map `db` to keep track of the count of each string that is read. If a string is encountered for the first time, it prints "OK" and sets the count of the string to 1 in the map. If a string is encountered again, it prints the string followed by its count.

Here are the steps we can take to optimize the program:

1. Remove unnecessary `#include` statements: The program does not use any functions from the `<algorithm>` header, so we can remove it.

2. Remove unnecessary `using` statement: The program only uses `std::map` and `std::string` from the `std` namespace, so we can remove the `using namespace std` statement and use the `std::` prefix for these classes.

3. Optimize I/O operations: The program currently uses `std::cin` and `std::cout` for input and output. These operations are slower compared to `scanf` and `printf` in C++. We can replace `std::cin` with `scanf` and `std::cout` with `printf` to improve the input/output performance.

4. Optimize the map operations: The program uses `std::map` to check if a string is already present in the map. This operation has a time complexity of O(log n). We can optimize this by using `std::unordered_map` which has an average time complexity of O(1) for finding an element.

5. Optimize string concatenation: The program currently concatenates the string and its count using the `+` operator. This operation creates a new string object and copies the contents of the original string and the count string. We can optimize this by using `std::to_string` to convert the count to a string and then append it to the original string.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(0), cin.tie(0);
  int n;
  string s;
  scanf("%d", &n);
  unordered_map<string, int> db;
  while (n--) {
    cin >> s;
    if (db.find(s) == db.end()) {
      printf("OK\n");
      db[s] = 1;
    } else {
      printf("%s%d\n", s.c_str(), db[s]++);
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```
