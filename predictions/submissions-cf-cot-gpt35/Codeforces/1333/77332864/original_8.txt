The given program calculates the sum of all possible subarrays of a given array `v` and outputs the result. 

To optimize the program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary header file inclusion: The program includes `<bits/stdc++.h>` which is not necessary. We can remove it.

2. Replace `scanf` and `printf` with `cin` and `cout`: The program uses `scanf` and `printf` for input and output respectively. However, `cin` and `cout` are generally faster and more efficient. We can replace `scanf` with `cin` and `printf` with `cout`.

3. Use `vector` instead of `map` and `vis` array: The program uses `map` and `vis` array to keep track of visited values. However, we can use a `vector` instead of `map` and `vis` array. This will save memory and improve performance.

4. Avoid unnecessary calculations: The program calculates `n * (n + 1) / 2` at the beginning to get the sum of numbers from 1 to `n`. However, we can avoid this calculation by using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series.

5. Remove unnecessary if condition: The program has an if condition `if (i - mp[cnt[i]] != n || !mx)` which checks if the current index is not equal to `n` or `mx` is zero. However, since `mx` is always updated to be greater than `mp[cnt[i]]`, this condition will always be true. We can remove this if condition.

Here is the optimized C++ program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int n;
  cin >> n;

  vector<long long> v(n + 1), cnt(n + 1, 0);
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++)
    cin >> v[i];

  vector<long long> mp(n + 1, -1);
  mp[0] = 0;

  long long ans = 0;
  long long mx = 0;

  for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    cnt[i] = cnt[i - 1] + v[i];

    if (mp[cnt[i]] != -1) {
      long long l = max(0LL, mp[cnt[i]] - mx);
      long long r = n - i;

      ans -= (l * r) + l + r;
      ans--;

      mx = max(mp[cnt[i]] + 1, mx);
    }

    mp[cnt[i]] = i;
  }

  cout << ans << endl;

  return 0;
}
```

Explanation of the optimization steps:

1. Removed unnecessary header file inclusion: The program does not require `<bits/stdc++.h>` since it includes all standard library headers. We can remove it.

2. Replaced `scanf` and `printf` with `cin` and `cout`: `cin` and `cout` are generally faster and more efficient than `scanf` and `printf`, so we replaced them for input and output respectively.

3. Used `vector` instead of `map` and `vis` array: We replaced the `map` and `vis` array with a `vector` to save memory and improve performance. We used `-1` as a special value to indicate that an element has not been visited.

4. Avoided unnecessary calculation: Instead of calculating `n * (n + 1) / 2`, we directly calculated the sum of the array `v` by updating `cnt[i] = cnt[i - 1] + v[i]` in each iteration.

5. Removed unnecessary if condition: The if condition `if (i - mp[cnt[i]] != n || !mx)` was always true, so we removed it.
