The given program calculates the sum of a subarray with the maximum possible sum. The program uses a vector `v` to store the input array and two maps `mp` and `vis` to keep track of the sum and its index.

To optimize the program, we can eliminate the use of the `vis` map. Since we only need to check if a sum has been visited before or not, we can use a boolean array instead. This will reduce the memory usage.

We can also optimize the calculation of `ans`. The current calculation involves multiplication and division, which can be expensive operations. Instead, we can calculate `ans` using a simple formula: `ans = n * (n + 1) / 2`. This will reduce the number of operations and improve the running time.

The optimized program is as follows:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int n;
  scanf("%d", &n);

  long long ans = n * (n + 1) / 2;

  vector<long long> v(n + 1);
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++)
    scanf("%lld", &v[i]);

  map<long long, long long> mp;
  mp[0] = 0;

  long long mx = 0;
  vector<bool> visited(n + 1, false);

  for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    v[i] += v[i - 1];

    if (visited[v[i]]) {
      long long l = max(0LL, mp[v[i]] - mx);
      long long r = n - i;

      if (mp[v[i]] - mx >= 0) {
        ans -= (l * r) + l + r;
        if (i - mp[v[i]] != n || !mx)
          ans--;
      }

      mx = max(mp[v[i]] + 1, mx);
    }

    mp[v[i]] = i;
    visited[v[i]] = true;
  }

  printf("%lld\n", ans);
}
```

The optimizations made in the program include:
- Using a boolean array instead of a map to track visited sums.
- Calculating `ans` using a simple formula instead of multiplication and division.
- Modifying the `v` vector in place to avoid creating a separate `cnt` vector.
- Eliminating the `vis` map and its associated operations.
