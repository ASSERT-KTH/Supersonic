The given program is already quite optimized in terms of code structure, but there are still some optimizations that can be made to improve the running time and memory usage.

Here are the steps to optimize the program:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The program includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header, which is not a standard C++ header and includes a lot of unnecessary headers. We can remove this line and include only the necessary headers, such as `<iostream>`, `<vector>`, and `<algorithm>`.

2. Avoid using `using namespace std;`: The program uses the `using namespace std;` directive, which brings all the names from the `std` namespace into the global namespace. This can lead to naming conflicts and make the code less readable. It is better to use the `std::` prefix for the standard library names, such as `std::cout`, `std::vector`, etc.

3. Remove unnecessary debug print statements: The program has debug print statements using the `dbg_out` function. We can remove these statements to improve the running time.

4. Avoid unnecessary type conversions: The program uses `int` for loop variables and array indices. Since the maximum value of `n` and `m` is given as `1e5`, we can use `int` instead of `long long` for loop variables and array indices to save memory.

5. Optimize the loop iterations: The program uses nested loops to iterate over the bits of each number. We can optimize this by using bitwise operations to check the value of each bit, instead of iterating over all the bits. This will reduce the number of iterations and improve the running time.

6. Optimize the shuffle operation: The program shuffles the `id` vector using the `shuffle` function. We can optimize this by using a more efficient shuffling algorithm, such as the Fisher-Yates shuffle.

7. Avoid unnecessary calculations: The program calculates the number of set bits in each subset using the `__builtin_popcount` function. We can optimize this by using a lookup table or a faster algorithm, such as the Brian Kernighan's algorithm, to count the number of set bits.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <random>

// Function to count the number of set bits using Brian Kernighan's algorithm
int countSetBits(int n) {
    int count = 0;
    while (n) {
        n &= (n - 1);
        count++;
    }
    return count;
}

int main() {
    std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
    std::cin.tie(nullptr);

    int n, m, p;
    std::cin >> n >> m >> p;

    std::vector<long long> a(n + 1);
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < m; j++) {
            char c;
            std::cin >> c;
            if (c == '1')
                a[i] += (1ll << j);
        }
    }

    std::vector<int> id(n + 1);
    for (int i = 0; i <= n; i++)
        id[i] = i;
    
    // Shuffle the id vector using Fisher-Yates shuffle
    std::random_device rd;
    std::mt19937 rng(rd());
    for (int i = n; i >= 1; i--) {
        std::uniform_int_distribution<int> uni(1, i);
        int j = uni(rng);
        std::swap(id[i], id[j]);
    }

    long long ans = 0;
    int num = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i <= std::min(200, n); i++) {
        std::vector<int> one;
        for (int j = 0; j < m; j++) {
            if ((a[id[i]] >> j) & 1)
                one.push_back(j);
        }
        std::vector<int> dp(1 << one.size());
        for (int j = 1; j <= n; j++) {
            int tmp = 0;
            for (int k = 0; k < one.size(); k++) {
                if ((a[j] >> one[k]) & 1)
                    tmp += (1 << k);
            }
            dp[tmp]++;
        }
        for (int j = 0; j < one.size(); j++) {
            for (int k = 0; k < (1 << one.size()); k++) {
                if (k & (1 << j))
                    dp[k ^ (1 << j)] += dp[k];
            }
        }
        for (int k = 0; k < (1 << one.size()); k++) {
            if (dp[k] >= (n + 1) / 2 && countSetBits(k) > num) {
                num = countSetBits(k);
                ans = 0;
                for (int j = 0; j < one.size(); j++) {
                    if (k & (1 << j))
                        ans += (1ll << one[j]);
                }
            }
        }
    }

    for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
        std::cout << ((ans >> i) & 1);
    }
    std::cout << '\n';

    return 0;
}
```

This optimized program eliminates unnecessary includes, avoids using `using namespace std;`, removes debug print statements, uses `int` instead of `long long` for loop variables and array indices, optimizes the loop iterations, optimizes the shuffle operation using the Fisher-Yates shuffle, and uses Brian Kernighan's algorithm to count the number of set bits. These optimizations should improve the running time and reduce the memory usage of the program.
