To optimize the given program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary headers: The `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` header includes a large number of standard library headers, which can slow down the compilation time. We can remove this line and include only the necessary headers.

2. Remove unnecessary template functions: The template functions `operator<<` and `dbg_out` are not used in the program. We can remove these functions to reduce the size of the compiled code.

3. Use a fixed-size array instead of a vector: The `vector<ll> a(n + 1)` and `vector<int> id(n + 1)` create dynamic arrays, which can have a small memory overhead compared to fixed-size arrays. Since the size of these arrays is known at compile time, we can use fixed-size arrays instead.

4. Use a fixed-size array instead of a vector for `dp`: The `vector<int> dp(1 << one.size())` creates a dynamic array, which can have a small memory overhead compared to a fixed-size array. Since the size of `dp` is known based on `one.size()`, we can use a fixed-size array instead.

5. Optimize the inner loops: The inner loops that calculate `tmp` and update `dp` can be optimized by using bitwise operations instead of individual bit checks. This can improve the performance of the program.

Here is the optimized C++ program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <numeric>
#include <random>
#include <chrono>
using namespace std;

using ll = long long;

mt19937 rng((unsigned int)chrono::steady_clock::now().time_since_epoch().count());

int main() {
    ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(nullptr);

    int n, m, p;
    cin >> n >> m >> p;

    ll a[100010] = {0};
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < m; j++) {
            char c;
            cin >> c;
            if (c == '1')
                a[i] += (1ll << j);
        }
    }

    int id[100010];
    for (int i = 0; i <= n; i++) {
        id[i] = i;
    }
    shuffle(id + 1, id + n + 1, rng);

    ll ans = 0;
    int num = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i <= min(200, n); i++) {
        vector<int> one;
        for (int j = 0; j < m; j++) {
            if ((a[id[i]] >> j) & 1)
                one.push_back(j);
        }

        int dp[1 << 10] = {0};
        for (int j = 1; j <= n; j++) {
            int tmp = a[j] & ((1 << one.size()) - 1);
            dp[tmp]++;
        }

        for (int j = 0; j < one.size(); j++) {
            for (int k = 0; k < (1 << one.size()); k++) {
                if (k & (1 << j))
                    dp[k ^ (1 << j)] += dp[k];
            }
        }

        for (int k = 0; k < (1 << one.size()); k++) {
            if (dp[k] >= (n + 1) / 2 && __builtin_popcount(k) > num) {
                num = __builtin_popcount(k);
                ans = 0;
                for (int j = 0; j < one.size(); j++) {
                    if (k & (1 << j))
                        ans += (1ll << one[j]);
                }
            }
        }
    }

    for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
        cout << ((ans >> i) & 1);
    }
    cout << '\n';

    return 0;
}
```

Explanation of the optimizations:

1. Removed unnecessary headers: The `bits/stdc++.h` header includes a large number of standard library headers, which is not necessary for this program. By including only the necessary headers, we can reduce the compilation time.

2. Removed unnecessary template functions: The template functions `operator<<` and `dbg_out` are not used in the program. By removing these functions, we can reduce the size of the compiled code.

3. Used fixed-size arrays: Instead of using vectors for `a` and `id`, we used fixed-size arrays since the size is known at compile time. This can reduce the memory overhead compared to dynamic arrays.

4. Used a fixed-size array for `dp`: Instead of using a vector for `dp`, we used a fixed-size array since the size is known based on `one.size()`. This can reduce the memory overhead compared to a dynamic array.

5. Optimized the inner loops: The inner loops that calculate `tmp` and update `dp` were optimized by using bitwise operations instead of individual bit checks. This can improve the performance of the program.
