Step 1: Avoid unnecessary includes

The program includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header, which is not a standard C++ header file and is not recommended to use in production code. It is better to include only the necessary standard library headers explicitly.

Step 2: Optimize the map initialization

The program uses a map to store the mapping between strings. Instead of initializing the map with an empty constructor and then assigning values inside the loop, we can directly initialize the map with the desired size.

Step 3: Optimize the vector initialization

Similarly, the program uses a vector to store the strings. We can optimize the initialization by reserving the necessary space in the vector before the loop, instead of assigning values inside the loop.

Step 4: Avoid unnecessary else statement

Inside the loop where the map is updated, there is no need for an else statement because the if condition covers all possibilities. We can remove the else statement and simplify the code.

Step 5: Use unordered_map instead of map

If the ordering of the keys is not important, we can use an unordered_map instead of a map. The unordered_map provides faster lookup time in most cases.

Step 6: Avoid unnecessary loop and use unordered_map directly

Instead of looping through the vector to find a matching string, we can directly use the unordered_map to check if the string exists and retrieve the corresponding value.

Step 7: Avoid unnecessary continue statement

Inside the loop where the strings are checked, there is no need for a continue statement because the loop will automatically continue to the next iteration. We can remove the continue statement and simplify the code.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int n, m;
  cin >> n >> m;

  unordered_map<string, string> mp;
  mp.reserve(m);

  vector<string> v;
  v.reserve(m);

  for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
    string x, y;
    cin >> x >> y;
    mp[x] = (x.length() <= y.length()) ? x : y;
    v.push_back(x);
  }

  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    string z;
    cin >> z;
    if (mp.count(z)) {
      cout << mp[z] << " ";
    }
  }

  return 0;
}
```
