The given program reads values into a map and a vector and then performs a search operation using the values in the vector. 

Here are the optimization steps:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The program includes the entire `bits/stdc++.h` library, which is not necessary. We can include only the necessary headers.

2. Optimize string comparison: The program compares the input string with each string in the vector using the `==` operator. This can be optimized by using the `unordered_map` data structure instead of the `map` and storing the indices of each string in the vector as values. This way, we can directly access the index of the desired string in constant time.

3. Remove unnecessary else statement: Inside the loop, there is no need for the else statement after the `break` statement. We can remove it to improve readability.

4. Remove unnecessary continue statement: The `continue` statement after the `break` statement is not necessary and can be removed.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int n, m;
  cin >> n >> m;

  unordered_map<string, int> mp;
  vector<string> v(m);

  for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
    string x, y;
    cin >> x >> y;
    if (x.length() <= y.length()) {
      mp[x] = i;
    } else {
      mp[x] = i;
    }
    v[i] = x;
  }

  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    string z;
    cin >> z;
    auto it = mp.find(z);
    if (it != mp.end()) {
      cout << v[it->second] << " ";
    }
  }

  return 0;
}
```
