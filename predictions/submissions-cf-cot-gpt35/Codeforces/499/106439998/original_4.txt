Optimization step by step:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The program includes the entire `<bits/stdc++.h>` header, which includes many unnecessary libraries. We can remove this and include only the necessary headers.

2. Optimize the map insertion: The current implementation of inserting elements into the map is not efficient. We can optimize it by using `emplace_hint` instead of `operator[]` to avoid unnecessary copying of string objects.

3. Avoid unnecessary string assignments: In the second loop, the program assigns `x` to `v[i]` for every iteration. However, the value of `x` does not change within the loop, so we can move this assignment outside the loop to avoid unnecessary string assignments.

4. Avoid unnecessary if-else statement: In the first loop, the program checks if `x.length() <= y.length()` and assigns `x` to `mp[x]` if true, otherwise assigns `y` to `mp[x]`. Instead, we can directly assign `x` to `mp[x]` and eliminate the if-else statement.

5. Use unordered_map instead of map: Since the order of elements does not matter in this program, we can use `unordered_map` instead of `map` to improve the performance of insertion and lookup operations.

Optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int n, m;
  cin >> n >> m;
  
  unordered_map<string, string> mp;
  vector<string> v(m);
  
  for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
    string x, y;
    cin >> x >> y;
    mp.emplace_hint(mp.end(), x, x);
    v[i] = x;
  }
  
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    string z;
    cin >> z;
    for (const auto& x : v) {
      if (z == x) {
        cout << mp[x] << " ";
        break;
      }
    }
  }
  
  return 0;
}
```
