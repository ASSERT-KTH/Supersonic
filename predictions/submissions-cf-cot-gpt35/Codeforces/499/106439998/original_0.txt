The given program takes input from the user and performs a mapping operation based on the length of the input strings. It then prints the corresponding mapped value for each input.

To optimize the program for running time and memory usage, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove the unnecessary inclusion of the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header file.
2. Replace the `map<string, string>` container with an `unordered_map<string, string>`. This will provide faster access to the mapped values.
3. Remove the vector `v` and iterate through the `unordered_map` directly in the second loop.
4. Use a reference to avoid unnecessary copying of strings in the second loop.
5. Remove the `else` statement in the first loop as it is not needed.

Here is the optimized C++ program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int n, m;
  cin >> n >> m;
  unordered_map<string, string> mp;
  for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
    string x, y;
    cin >> x >> y;
    mp[x] = (x.length() <= y.length()) ? x : y;
  }
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    string z;
    cin >> z;
    auto it = mp.find(z);
    if (it != mp.end()) {
      cout << it->second << " ";
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized program reduces the memory usage and improves the running time by using an unordered map instead of a map and eliminating the unnecessary vector and string copying operations.
