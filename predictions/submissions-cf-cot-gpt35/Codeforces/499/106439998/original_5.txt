The given program can be optimized in the following steps:

1. Remove unnecessary headers: The program includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header, which is not standard and includes a lot of unnecessary headers. We can remove this line and include only the necessary headers.

2. Avoid unnecessary copying: In the loop where the input strings are read into the vector `v`, there is no need to copy the strings from `x` to `v[i]`. We can directly store the reference of `x` in `v[i]` to avoid unnecessary copying.

3. Avoid unnecessary comparisons: In the loop where the input strings are compared with the strings in `v`, there is no need to compare the strings using the `==` operator and then break the loop. We can directly access the corresponding value from the map `mp` using the string `z` as the key and print it.

4. Use `unordered_map` instead of `map`: Since the order of the strings in `v` does not matter, we can use an `unordered_map` instead of a `map` to improve the performance. `unordered_map` has a faster average access time compared to `map` when the number of elements is large.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <string>
#include <vector>

int main() {
  int n, m;
  std::cin >> n >> m;

  std::unordered_map<std::string, std::string> mp;
  std::vector<std::string> v(m);

  for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
    std::string x, y;
    std::cin >> x >> y;
    mp[x] = (x.length() <= y.length()) ? x : y;
    v[i] = std::move(x);
  }

  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    std::string z;
    std::cin >> z;
    std::cout << mp[z] << " ";
  }

  return 0;
}
```
