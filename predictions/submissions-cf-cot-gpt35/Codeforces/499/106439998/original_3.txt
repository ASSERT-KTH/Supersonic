The given program can be optimized in the following steps:

1. Remove unnecessary header file inclusion: The program includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header, which is not necessary and can be removed.

2. Optimize the use of `map` container: The program uses a `map` container to store the mappings between strings. However, since the program only needs to lookup the mappings, a more efficient data structure like `unordered_map` can be used instead.

3. Avoid unnecessary copying of strings: The program creates a vector `v` to store the strings, but then also copies each string from `x` to `v[i]`. This can be avoided by directly using `x` instead of `v[i]` in the later loop.

4. Use a set to store the strings: Instead of iterating over the vector `v` for each input string, we can use a set to directly check if the input string exists in the set. This will reduce the time complexity from O(n*m) to O(n+m).

Here is the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <unordered_set>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int n, m;
  cin >> n >> m;
  
  unordered_map<string, string> mp;
  unordered_set<string> strings;
  
  for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
    string x, y;
    cin >> x >> y;
    if (x.length() <= y.length()) {
      mp[x] = x;
    } else {
      mp[x] = y;
    }
    strings.insert(x);
  }
  
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    string z;
    cin >> z;
    if (strings.count(z)) {
      cout << mp[z] << " ";
    }
  }
  
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized version improves the program's performance by using a more efficient data structure and reducing unnecessary operations.
