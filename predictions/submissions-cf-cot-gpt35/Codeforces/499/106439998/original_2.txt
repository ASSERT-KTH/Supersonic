The given program reads two integers `n` and `m`, and then reads `m` pairs of strings `x` and `y`. It creates a map `mp` where each key `x` is mapped to a value `y` if the length of `x` is greater than the length of `y`, otherwise the key `x` is mapped to itself. It also creates a vector `v` where each element is one of the `x` values read. Finally, it reads `n` strings `z` and for each string, it checks if it exists in the vector `v`. If it does, it prints the value of `mp[x]`. 

To optimize this program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Instead of using `map<string, string>`, we can use `unordered_map<string, string>` which typically provides faster lookup and insert operations.
2. Instead of storing all `x` values in the vector `v`, we can directly check if the current string `z` exists in the unordered_map `mp` by using the `find` function. If it exists, we can directly print the value.
3. We can remove the unnecessary `else` and `continue` statements in the inner loop.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int n, m;
  cin >> n >> m;
  unordered_map<string, string> mp;
  for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
    string x, y;
    cin >> x >> y;
    if (x.length() <= y.length()) {
      mp[x] = x;
    } else {
      mp[x] = y;
    }
  }
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    string z;
    cin >> z;
    auto it = mp.find(z);
    if (it != mp.end()) {
      cout << it->second << " ";
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```
