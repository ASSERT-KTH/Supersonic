The given program can be optimized in several ways:

1. Remove unnecessary header file: The program includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header file, which is not standard and includes a large number of unnecessary header files. We can remove this line and include only the necessary header files.

2. Avoid unnecessary copying: In the first loop, the program stores the input strings in the `v` vector. However, this is not necessary as we only need to compare the input strings with the keys in the `mp` map. We can remove the vector `v` and directly compare the input string with the keys in the map.

3. Avoid redundant comparisons: In the second loop, the program iterates over the input strings and compares them with the keys in the map. However, if a match is found, we can directly output the corresponding value from the map and break out of the loop. This will avoid unnecessary comparisons.

4. Use unordered_map instead of map: The use of `map` can be replaced with `unordered_map` for better performance, as it has an average constant time complexity for insertion, deletion, and retrieval.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int n, m;
  cin >> n >> m;
  
  unordered_map<string, string> mp;
  for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
    string x, y;
    cin >> x >> y;
    mp[x] = (x.length() <= y.length()) ? x : y;
  }
  
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    string z;
    cin >> z;
    if (mp.find(z) != mp.end()) {
      cout << mp[z] << " ";
    }
  }
  
  return 0;
}
```

Explanation of optimizations:

1. Removed unnecessary header file: The `<bits/stdc++.h>` header file is not standard and includes unnecessary header files. We removed it and included only the necessary header files `<iostream>` and `<unordered_map>`.

2. Avoided unnecessary copying: The vector `v` was storing the input strings, but it was not necessary. We removed it and directly compared the input string with the keys in the map.

3. Avoided redundant comparisons: Instead of iterating over the input strings and comparing them with the keys in the map, we used the `find()` function of the unordered_map to check if the input string exists in the map. If it does, we output the corresponding value directly.

4. Used unordered_map instead of map: The use of `unordered_map` provides better performance compared to `map`. It has an average constant time complexity for insertion, deletion, and retrieval operations, which is beneficial for this program.
