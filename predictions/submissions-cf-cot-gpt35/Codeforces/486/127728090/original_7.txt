The given program calculates the sum of numbers from 1 to n, where n is an input from the user. If n is even, the sum is n/2, and if n is odd, the sum is -(n+1)/2. 

To optimize this program, we can eliminate the use of the if-else statement by using a single formula to calculate the sum directly. 

When n is even, the formula n/2 works correctly. When n is odd, the formula -(n+1)/2 can be simplified to -n/2. 

By using the formula sum = (-1)^n * (n+1)/2, we can calculate the sum directly without the need for conditional statements.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  long long n;
  cin >> n;

  long long sum = (-1) * ((n+1) / 2);
  cout << sum << endl;

  return 0;
}
```

This optimized program calculates the sum of numbers from 1 to n using a single formula, reducing the need for conditional statements and improving the program's efficiency.
