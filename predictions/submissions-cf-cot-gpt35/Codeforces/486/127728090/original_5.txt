Explanation of optimization steps:

1. Instead of including the entire `<bits/stdc++.h>` header, we can include only the necessary headers. In this case, we only need `<iostream>` for `cin` and `cout`.

2. The variable `sum` is unnecessary. We can directly output the value without storing it in a separate variable.

3. Instead of using `if-else` to determine the value of `sum`, we can use a single expression to calculate the value based on the parity of `n`. This eliminates the need for the condition check.

4. We can remove the `return 0` statement at the end of the `main` function as it is not necessary.

Optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  long long n;
  cin >> n;
  
  cout << (n % 2 == 0 ? n / 2 : (n + 1) / 2 * (-1)) << endl;
}
```
