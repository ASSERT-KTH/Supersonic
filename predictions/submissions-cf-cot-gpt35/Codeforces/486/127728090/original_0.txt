Step 1: Remove unnecessary header file inclusion
The program includes the header file `<bits/stdc++.h>`, which is not a standard C++ header file and is not necessary for this program. We can remove this line.

Step 2: Simplify the calculation of `sum`
The calculation of `sum` can be simplified by using the ternary operator. Instead of using an if-else statement, we can directly calculate `sum` based on the condition `n % 2 == 0`.

Step 3: Remove unnecessary variable initialization
The variable `sum` is initialized to 0 before being assigned a value inside the if-else statement. This initialization is unnecessary and can be removed.

Step 4: Optimize input/output operations
The program uses the `cin` and `cout` methods for input and output operations. These methods are slower compared to other input/output methods like `scanf` and `printf`. We can optimize the input/output operations by using `scanf` and `printf` instead of `cin` and `cout`.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  long long n;
  scanf("%lld", &n);

  long long sum = (n % 2 == 0) ? n / 2 : ((n + 1) / 2) * (-1);

  printf("%lld\n", sum);
  return 0;
}
```
