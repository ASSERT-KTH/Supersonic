The given program calculates the sum of the numbers from 1 to n and outputs it. However, it can be optimized by eliminating the need for the if-else statement and reducing the number of calculations.

Here's the step-by-step optimization:

1. Remove the unnecessary inclusion of the entire `bits/stdc++.h` library. Instead, include the necessary headers for the program.
2. Remove the unnecessary `using namespace std;` statement.
3. Change the data type of `n` and `sum` to `int` since the program only deals with positive integers.
4. Modify the calculation of `sum` to simplify the logic and reduce the number of calculations.

Here's the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  int n;
  std::cin >> n;

  int sum = (n % 2 == 0) ? n / 2 : -((n + 1) / 2);
  std::cout << sum << std::endl;

  return 0;
}
```
