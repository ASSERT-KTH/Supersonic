The given program calculates the sum of the first n numbers. If n is even, the sum is n/2, and if n is odd, the sum is (n+1)/2 multiplied by -1.

To optimize this program, we can eliminate the unnecessary use of the long long data type and remove the unnecessary if-else statement.

Here are the steps to optimize the program:

1. Remove the unnecessary include statement for the bits/stdc++.h header file. We only need the iostream header file for cin and cout.
2. Change the data type of n and sum to int, as the problem statement does not specify the requirement for long long data type.
3. Instead of using an if-else statement to calculate the sum, we can use a single formula that works for both even and odd values of n. The formula is (n + 1) / 2 * (-1). This formula gives the same result as the original program.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int n, sum;
  cin >> n;
  sum = (n + 1) / 2 * (-1);
  cout << sum << endl;
  return 0;
}
```
