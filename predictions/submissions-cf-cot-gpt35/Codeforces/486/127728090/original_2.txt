The original program calculates the sum of numbers from 1 to n using a conditional statement. If n is even, it calculates the sum as n/2. If n is odd, it calculates the sum as (n+1)/2*(-1).

To optimize the program, we can eliminate the conditional statement and calculate the sum directly using a formula that works for both even and odd values of n.

The sum of numbers from 1 to n can be calculated as (n*(n+1))/2. This formula works for both even and odd values of n.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  long long n;
  std::cin >> n;

  long long sum = (n * (n + 1)) / 2;

  std::cout << sum << std::endl;
  return 0;
}
```

In the optimized program, we removed the unnecessary `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` since it includes all the standard C++ libraries which are not required in this program.

We also removed the conditional statement and directly calculated the sum using the formula `(n * (n + 1)) / 2`. This formula works for both even and odd values of n, eliminating the need for the conditional statement.
