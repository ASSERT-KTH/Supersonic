The given program calculates the sum of the first n integers and stores it in the variable `sum`. If n is even, the sum is simply n divided by 2. If n is odd, the sum is -((n + 1) / 2).

To optimize the program, we can remove the unnecessary inclusion of the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header file and change the logic for calculating the sum of odd numbers.

Here are the optimization steps:
1. Remove the unnecessary inclusion of `<bits/stdc++.h>` header file.
2. Change the logic for calculating the sum of odd numbers. Instead of using the formula ((n + 1) / 2) * (-1), we can use the simpler formula -(n / 2).

Here is the optimized program:

```c++
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  long long n, sum;
  cin >> n;
  if (n % 2 == 0) {
    sum = n / 2;
  } else {
    sum = -(n / 2);
  }
  cout << sum << endl;
  return 0;
}
```
