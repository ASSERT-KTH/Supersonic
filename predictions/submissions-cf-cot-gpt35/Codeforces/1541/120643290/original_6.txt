To optimize the given program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary header files: The program includes `<bits/stdc++.h>` which is a non-standard header file and includes a lot of unnecessary headers. We can remove this line and include only the necessary headers.

2. Remove unnecessary macros: The program defines macros like `pb`, `ll`, `pi`, `pll`, `vii`, `vi`, `vvi`, `vll`, `all`, `print`, `loop`, `pb` which are not used in the program. We can remove these macros to simplify the code.

3. Remove unnecessary function `fastIo()`: The function `fastIo()` is not used in the program. We can remove this function.

4. Use `int` instead of `ll`: The variables `n`, `ans`, `i`, `j` are declared as `ll` (long long) which is not necessary. We can use `int` instead of `ll` to save memory.

5. Avoid unnecessary vector initialization: The vector `a` is initialized with size `n` but it is not necessary. We can directly push elements into the vector using `push_back()`.

6. Remove unnecessary sort: The vector `a` is sorted using `sort()` function, but it is not necessary as we are only interested in the count of pairs, not the actual pairs.

7. Optimize the inner loop: The inner loop can be optimized by using a mathematical condition instead of iterating through all possible pairs. We can use the formula `a[i].second + a[j].second = a[i].first * a[j].first` to check if a pair satisfies the condition.

8. Simplify the output: Instead of using `endl`, we can use `\n` to output a newline character which is faster.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

void solve() {
    int n, ans = 0;
    cin >> n;
    vector<pair<int, int>> a;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        int x;
        cin >> x;
        a.push_back({x, i + 1});
    }
    for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
        for (int j = i + 1; j < n; j++) {
            if (a[i].first * a[j].first >= 2 * n)
                break;
            else if (a[i].first * a[j].first == a[i].second + a[j].second)
                ans++;
        }
    }
    cout << ans << "\n";
}

int main() {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(NULL);

    int t;
    cin >> t;
    while (t--)
        solve();
    return 0;
}
```

By making these optimizations, the program should run faster and use less memory.
