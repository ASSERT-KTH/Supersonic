Optimization steps:

1. Remove unnecessary header file inclusion: The program includes `<bits/stdc++.h>` which is a non-standard header file and includes a lot of unnecessary headers. We can remove this line and include only the necessary headers.

2. Remove unnecessary macros: The program defines macros for various types and functions, such as `pb`, `ll`, `pi`, etc. These macros are not used in the program and can be removed.

3. Remove unnecessary typedefs: The program typedefs various types, such as `vii`, `vi`, `vvi`, etc. These typedefs are not used in the program and can be removed.

4. Remove unnecessary print statement: The program has a macro `print` which is used for debugging purposes. We can remove this macro as it is not necessary for the final program.

5. Avoid unnecessary vector initialization: The program initializes a vector `a` with size `n`, but then assigns values to its elements in a loop. We can avoid this initialization and directly assign values to the vector elements in the loop.

6. Avoid unnecessary sorting: The program sorts the vector `a` using the `sort` function. However, the sorting is not necessary for the final result, as we only need to count the number of pairs that satisfy the given condition. We can remove the sorting step to improve the running time.

7. Optimize the pair comparison condition: The program checks the condition `(a[i].first * a[j].first) == (a[i].second + a[j].second)` to count the pairs. We can optimize this condition by checking if `(a[i].first * a[j].first) - (a[i].second + a[j].second) == 0`, which avoids the multiplication operation.

8. Optimize the loop condition: The program uses nested loops to iterate over all pairs of elements. We can optimize the loop condition to avoid unnecessary iterations. For example, if `a[i].first * a[j].first` is greater than or equal to `2 * n`, we can break the inner loop, as there won't be any pairs satisfying the condition.

9. Avoid unnecessary file operations: The program uses `freopen` to redirect input and output to files. We can remove these file operations as they are not necessary for the final program.

Optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

void solve() {
    int n, ans = 0;
    std::cin >> n;
    std::vector<std::pair<int, int>> a(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        std::cin >> a[i].first;
        a[i].second = i + 1;
    }
    for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
        for (int j = i + 1; j < n; j++) {
            if ((a[i].first * a[j].first) >= 2 * n)
                break;
            else if ((a[i].first * a[j].first) - (a[i].second + a[j].second) == 0)
                ans++;
        }
    }
    std::cout << ans << std::endl;
}

int main() {
    std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    std::cin.tie(NULL);
    int t;
    std::cin >> t;
    while (t--)
        solve();
    return 0;
}
```

The optimized program removes unnecessary code and improves the running time and memory usage.
