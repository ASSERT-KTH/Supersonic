Step 1: Remove unnecessary headers
- The program includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header, which is not recommended as it includes a lot of unnecessary headers. We can remove this line and only include the necessary headers.

Step 2: Remove unnecessary macros
- The program defines several macros (`pb`, `ll`, `pi`, `pll`, `vii`, `vi`, `vvi`, `vll`, `all`, `print`, `loop`) that are not used in the program. We can remove these macros to simplify the code.

Step 3: Optimize input/output
- The program uses `cin` and `cout` for input/output, which can be slow for large inputs/outputs. We can replace them with `scanf` and `printf` for faster I/O.

Step 4: Optimize sorting
- The program sorts the `a` vector using the `sort` function. However, we can optimize the sorting by using a custom sorting function that compares the second element of each pair instead of the first element. This way, we can avoid unnecessary comparisons and improve the sorting performance.

Step 5: Optimize the nested loop
- The program uses a nested loop to compare each pair of elements in the `a` vector. However, we can optimize this by using a single loop and calculating the number of valid pairs directly. This way, we can avoid unnecessary comparisons and improve the overall performance.

Here is the optimized C++ program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

void solve() {
  int n, ans = 0;
  scanf("%d", &n);
  
  vector<pair<int, int>> a(n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    scanf("%d", &a[i].first);
    a[i].second = i + 1;
  }
  
  sort(a.begin(), a.end(), [](const pair<int, int>& x, const pair<int, int>& y) {
    return x.second < y.second;
  });
  
  for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
    if ((long long)a[i].first * a[i+1].first >= 2 * n)
      break;
    if ((long long)a[i].first * a[i+1].first == a[i].second + a[i+1].second)
      ans++;
  }
  
  printf("%d\n", ans);
}

int main() {
  int t;
  scanf("%d", &t);
  
  while (t--)
    solve();
  
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized program eliminates unnecessary headers and macros, optimizes the input/output, and improves the sorting and loop logic for better performance.
