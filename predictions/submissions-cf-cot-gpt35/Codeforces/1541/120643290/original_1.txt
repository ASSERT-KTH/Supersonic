Step 1: Remove unnecessary headers
- The program includes `<bits/stdc++.h>`, which includes a lot of unnecessary headers. We should only include the necessary headers to reduce compilation time and memory usage.
- In this program, the following headers are not needed: `<bits/stdc++.h>`, `<vector>`, `<iostream>`.
- We can remove these unnecessary headers.

Step 2: Remove unnecessary macros
- The program defines several macros, such as `pb`, `ll`, `pi`, `pll`, `vii`, `vi`, `vvi`, `vll`, `all`, `print`, `loop`, `pb`.
- These macros are not used in the program. We can remove them to reduce memory usage and improve code readability.

Step 3: Optimize input/output operations
- The program uses `cin` and `cout` for input and output operations. These operations are relatively slow compared to other methods like `scanf` and `printf` in C.
- We can replace `cin` with `scanf` and `cout` with `printf` to improve the performance of input/output operations.

Step 4: Optimize the sorting algorithm
- The program uses the `sort` function to sort the input vector `a`. By default, `sort` uses the comparison operator `<` to compare elements.
- However, in this program, we only need to sort the vector based on the first element of each pair.
- We can optimize the sorting algorithm by providing a custom comparison function that compares only the first element of each pair.
- This will reduce the number of comparisons and improve the sorting performance.

Step 5: Optimize the nested loops
- The program uses nested loops to iterate over all pairs of elements in the vector `a`.
- However, the inner loop can be optimized by using a conditional statement to break the loop early when the condition is met.
- We can break the inner loop when the product of the first elements of the current pair and the next pair is greater than or equal to twice the value of `n`.
- This will reduce the number of unnecessary iterations and improve the overall performance of the program.

Here is the optimized C++ program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

void fastIo() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
}

void solve() {
  int n, ans = 0;
  scanf("%d", &n);
  vector<pair<int, int>> a(n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    scanf("%d", &a[i].first);
    a[i].second = i + 1;
  }
  sort(a.begin(), a.end(), [](const pair<int, int>& p1, const pair<int, int>& p2) {
    return p1.first < p2.first;
  });
  for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
    for (int j = i + 1; j < n; j++) {
      if ((1LL * a[i].first * a[j].first) >= 2 * n)
        break;
      else if ((1LL * a[i].first * a[j].first) == (a[i].second + a[j].second))
        ans++;
    }
  }
  printf("%d\n", ans);
}

int main() {
#ifndef ONLINE_JUDGE
  freopen("input.txt", "r", stdin);
  freopen("output.txt", "w", stdout);
#endif
  fastIo();
  int t;
  scanf("%d", &t);
  while (t--)
    solve();
  return 0;
}
```

Explanation of the optimizations:

- Removed unnecessary headers to reduce compilation time and memory usage.
- Removed unnecessary macros to reduce memory usage and improve code readability.
- Replaced `cin` with `scanf` and `cout` with `printf` to improve the performance of input/output operations.
- Provided a custom comparison function for sorting to optimize the sorting algorithm.
- Optimized the nested loops by breaking the inner loop early when the condition is met to reduce unnecessary iterations.
