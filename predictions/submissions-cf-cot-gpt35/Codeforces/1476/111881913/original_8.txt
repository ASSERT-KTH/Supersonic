The given program reads an integer `t` as the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`, followed by an array `v` of `n` elements. The program then calculates the number of additional elements required in the array `v` such that the sum of the elements is at least `k` times the sum of the previous elements.

To optimize this program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary include: The program includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header, which is not necessary and can be replaced with the specific headers that are actually used in the program.

2. Use `int` instead of `ull` for `sum`: The variable `sum` is used to store the sum of elements in the array `v`. Since the elements of `v` are of type `ull`, it is safe to assume that the sum will not exceed the range of `int`. Therefore, we can use `int` instead of `ull` for the `sum` variable, which will reduce memory usage.

3. Remove unnecessary `sum += v[i];` statement: After calculating the number of additional elements required, the program increments the `sum` variable by adding the current element `v[i]`. However, this is unnecessary as the sum is not used after this point. Removing this statement will improve running time.

4. Remove unnecessary `else` statement: The `else` statement in the inner `if` condition is not needed. We can simply add `x / k` to both `ans` and `sum`, which will achieve the same result.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int t;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    int n, k;
    cin >> n >> k;
    vector<int> v(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      cin >> v[i];
    }
    int ans = 0;
    int sum = v[0];
    for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
      if ((v[i] * 100) > sum * k) {
        int x = v[i] * 100 - sum * k;
        ans += (x / k) + 1;
        sum += (x / k) + 1;
      }
    }
    cout << ans << endl;
  }
}
```

This optimized program will have improved running time and reduced memory usage compared to the original program.
