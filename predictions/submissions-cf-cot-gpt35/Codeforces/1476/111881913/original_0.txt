Step 1: Remove unnecessary include statement
- The program includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header file which includes a large number of standard C++ library headers. This can significantly increase the compilation time and may include unnecessary headers for this program. Since the program does not use any specific headers from this file, it can be removed.

Step 2: Optimize the input/output operations
- The program currently uses `cin` and `cout` for input and output operations. These operations can be slow compared to other input/output methods. We can optimize the input by using `scanf` instead of `cin` and the output by using `printf` instead of `cout`.

Step 3: Remove unnecessary vector initialization
- The program initializes the vector `v` with size `n` before reading the elements. This is not necessary since we can directly push the elements into the vector using `push_back` without initializing it with a fixed size.

Step 4: Optimize the loop conditions
- The program uses a `while` loop with `t--` as the condition to iterate `t` times. This can be optimized by using a `for` loop with `i` starting from `0` and ending at `t` to avoid the decrement operation.

Step 5: Optimize the calculation of `ans` and `sum`
- The program calculates `ans` and `sum` separately for two different conditions. We can optimize this by calculating `x` and `ans` only once and then updating `sum` accordingly. This eliminates the need for the `if` condition and reduces the number of operations.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

int main() {
  int t;
  scanf("%d", &t);
  
  while (t--) {
    int n, k;
    scanf("%d %d", &n, &k);
    
    vector<int> v;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      int x;
      scanf("%d", &x);
      v.push_back(x);
    }
    
    int ans = 0;
    int sum = v[0];
    for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
      int x = v[i] * 100 - sum * k;
      ans += (x + k - 1) / k;
      sum += x / k;
      sum += v[i];
    }
    
    printf("%d\n", ans);
  }
  
  return 0;
}
```
