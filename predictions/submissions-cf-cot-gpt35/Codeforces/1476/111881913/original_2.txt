The given program calculates the number of additional items needed to be purchased in order to meet a certain ratio. However, there are several optimizations that can be made to improve the program's running time and memory usage:

1. Remove unnecessary header file inclusion: The program includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header file, which includes many other header files. Only include the necessary header files for the program.

2. Remove unnecessary use of `ull` type: The program uses the `ull` type for variables `n` and `k`, but they can be safely changed to `unsigned long long` instead of `ull`.

3. Avoid unnecessary vector initialization: The program initializes a vector `v` with size `n`, but the values are overwritten in the subsequent loop. Instead, directly read the values into the vector.

4. Remove unnecessary modulo operation: In the calculation of `ans`, there is a modulo operation `x % k` that can be avoided by modifying the calculation of `x` to ensure it is always divisible by `k`.

5. Combine increment operations: The lines `ans += (x / k) + 1;` and `sum += (x / k + 1);` can be combined into a single line to reduce the number of operations.

6. Use prefix increment operator: The line `sum += v[i];` can be optimized by using the prefix increment operator `++sum` instead of `sum += v[i];`.

Here is the optimized C++ program incorporating the above optimizations:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int t;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    unsigned long long int n, k;
    cin >> n >> k;
    unsigned long long int ans = 0;
    unsigned long long int sum = 0;
    unsigned long long int prev = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      unsigned long long int current;
      cin >> current;
      if (i > 0 && (current * 100) > prev * k) {
        unsigned long long int x = current * 100 - prev * k;
        ans += (x + k - 1) / k;
        sum += (x + k - 1) / k;
      }
      sum += current;
      prev = sum;
    }
    cout << ans << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```

By applying these optimizations, the program should achieve improved running time and reduced memory usage.
