The given program aims to calculate the number of additional items needed in a shopping list to ensure that the average price of the items is greater than a given value.

To optimize the program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary header inclusion: The program includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header, which includes all standard library headers. This can significantly increase the compilation time and memory usage. Since we only need a few specific headers, we can replace it with the necessary headers.

2. Remove unnecessary variable: The variable `k` is only used to calculate `sum * k`, which can be done directly with `sum` itself. Therefore, we can remove the variable `k` and use `sum` instead.

3. Use integer division instead of modulus: Instead of using the modulus operator `%` to check if `x` is divisible by `k`, we can use integer division `/` to directly calculate the quotient. This can simplify the code and improve performance.

4. Avoid unnecessary addition in the `else` branch: In the `else` branch of the condition `(x % k != 0)`, we can remove the addition of `1` to `ans` and `sum` since `x / k` is an integer division and will already be rounded down. This can save unnecessary computations.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#define ull unsigned long long int

using namespace std;

int main() {
  int t;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    ull n;
    cin >> n;
    vector<ull> v(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      cin >> v[i];
    }
    ull ans = 0;
    ull sum = v[0];
    for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
      if (v[i] * 100 > sum) {
        ull x = v[i] * 100 - sum;
        ans += x / sum;
        sum += x / sum;
      }
      sum += v[i];
    }
    cout << ans << endl;
  }
}
```

By making these optimizations, we have improved the program's running time and memory usage.
