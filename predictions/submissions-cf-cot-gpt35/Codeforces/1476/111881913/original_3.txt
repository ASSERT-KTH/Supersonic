Step 1: Remove unnecessary includes

The `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` includes a large number of standard library headers, which can slow down compilation and increase memory usage. In this program, we only need `<iostream>` and `<vector>`, so we can remove the unnecessary include statement.

Step 2: Avoid using `using namespace std;`

Using the entire `std` namespace can lead to naming conflicts and make the code harder to read. Instead, we can prefix the standard library classes and functions with `std::` to make it clear where they come from.

Step 3: Optimize the loop

Currently, the loop iterates through the vector `v` twice - once to calculate the sum and once to calculate the answer. We can optimize this by combining both calculations into a single loop. This reduces the number of iterations and improves the overall performance.

Step 4: Remove unnecessary checks

The conditional statement `(x % k != 0)` is not necessary because the division operation already takes care of the case where `x` is not divisible by `k`. We can remove this check to simplify the code.

Step 5: Optimize the division and addition operations

Currently, the code performs the division operation twice - once in the calculation of `ans` and once in the calculation of `sum`. We can optimize this by calculating the result of the division only once and storing it in a variable. Similarly, we can optimize the addition operation by using compound assignment operators (`+=`) instead of separate addition operations.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

int main() {
  int t;
  std::cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    unsigned long long int n, k;
    std::cin >> n >> k;
    std::vector<unsigned long long int> v(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      std::cin >> v[i];
    }
    unsigned long long int ans = 0;
    unsigned long long int sum = v[0];
    unsigned long long int x;
    for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
      if ((v[i] * 100) > sum * k) {
        x = v[i] * 100 - sum * k;
        ans += (x / k) + 1;
        sum += (x / k) + 1;
      }
      sum += v[i];
    }
    std::cout << ans << std::endl;
  }
}
```
