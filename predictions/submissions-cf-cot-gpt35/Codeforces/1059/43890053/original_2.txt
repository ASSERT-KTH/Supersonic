The given program calculates the maximum radius of a circle centered at the origin such that all given points lie inside the circle. The program uses binary search to find the maximum radius.

To optimize the program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary header files: The program includes several unnecessary header files that are not used. We can remove these header files to improve the compile time and reduce memory usage.

2. Remove unused macros: The program defines two macros `line` and `mem` but they are not used anywhere in the code. We can remove these macros to simplify the code.

3. Remove unnecessary variables and constants: The program declares and initializes several unnecessary variables and constants that are not used. We can remove these variables to reduce memory usage.

4. Simplify the calculation of `l` and `r`: The variables `l` and `r` are initialized to very large and very small values respectively. Instead, we can initialize `l` to 0 and `r` to `inf`, where `inf` is the maximum possible value for `long double`. This will simplify the calculation of `l` and `r` in the `isOk` function.

5. Remove unnecessary `else` block: The `else` block in the main function is not needed as it does not contain any code other than the return statement. We can remove the `else` block to simplify the code.

Here is the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <cstdio>
#include <cmath>

const int maxn = 2000 + 10;
double x[maxn], y[maxn];
int n;

bool isOk(long double k) {
  long double l = 0, r = 1e18;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    if (y[i] > k * 2) {
      return false;
    }
    double tmp = sqrt(k * k - (k - y[i]) * (k - y[i]));
    l = fmax(l, x[i] - tmp);
    r = fmin(r, x[i] + tmp);
  }
  return l < r;
}

int main() {
  scanf("%d", &n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    scanf("%lf %lf", &x[i], &y[i]);
  }
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    if (y[i] * y[n - 1] < 0) {
      printf("-1\n");
      return 0;
    }
    y[i] = fabs(y[i]);
  }
  long double l = 0, r = 1e18, mid;
  for (int i = 1; i <= 100; i++) {
    mid = (l + r) / 2.0;
    if (isOk(mid)) {
      r = mid;
    } else {
      l = mid;
    }
  }
  printf("%.10Lf\n", mid);
}
```
