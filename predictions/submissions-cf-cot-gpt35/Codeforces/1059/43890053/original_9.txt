Step 1: Remove unnecessary includes
- The program includes several unnecessary libraries such as `<algorithm>`, `<bitset>`, `<deque>`, `<list>`, `<map>`, `<queue>`, `<set>`, and `<stack>`. These libraries are not used in the program and can be removed to improve compilation time and reduce memory usage.

Step 2: Remove unused macros
- The program defines two macros `line` and `mem`, but they are not used anywhere in the program. These macros can be removed to simplify the code.

Step 3: Use `double` instead of `long double`
- The program uses `long double` for some variables, but there is no need for such high precision in this case. Using `double` instead of `long double` will improve memory usage.

Step 4: Optimize the `isOk` function
- The `isOk` function calculates the values of `l` and `r` in each iteration of the loop. However, the values of `l` and `r` are updated only if the condition `l < r` is satisfied. We can optimize this by initializing `l` and `r` to the maximum and minimum possible values respectively, and updating them only when the condition is satisfied.

Step 5: Optimize the binary search loop
- The binary search loop in the main function can be optimized by using a more efficient termination condition. Instead of running the loop for a fixed number of iterations, we can terminate the loop when the difference between `l` and `r` becomes smaller than a certain threshold.

Here is the optimized C++ program:

```cpp
#include <cmath>
#include <cstdio>

const int maxn = 2000 + 10;
double x[100000 + 10], y[100000 + 10];
int n;

bool isOk(double k) {
  double l = -1e17, r = 1e17;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    if (y[i] > k * 2) {
      return false;
    }
    double tmp = sqrt(k * k - (k - y[i]) * (k - y[i]));
    l = fmax(l, x[i] - tmp);
    r = fmin(r, x[i] + tmp);
  }
  return l < r;
}

int main() {
  scanf("%d", &n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    scanf("%lf %lf", &x[i], &y[i]);
  }
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    if (y[i] * y[n - 1] < 0) {
      printf("-1\n");
      return 0;
    } else {
      y[i] = fabs(y[i]);
    }
  }
  double l = 0, r = 1e17;
  double mid = (l + r) / 2.0;
  while (r - l > 1e-10) {
    mid = (l + r) / 2.0;
    if (isOk(mid)) {
      r = mid;
    } else {
      l = mid;
    }
  }
  printf("%.10lf\n", mid);
}
```
