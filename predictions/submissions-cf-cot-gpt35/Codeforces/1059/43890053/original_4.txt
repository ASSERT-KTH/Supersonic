Step 1: Remove unnecessary header files.
- The program includes several header files that are not used in the code. These unnecessary includes can be removed to improve compilation time and reduce memory usage.

Step 2: Remove unnecessary macros.
- The program defines two macros (`line` and `mem`) that are not used. These macros can be removed to simplify the code and improve readability.

Step 3: Remove unused variables.
- The program declares and initializes two variables (`const int inf` and `const int mod`) that are not used. These variables can be removed to reduce memory usage.

Step 4: Optimize the `isOk` function.
- The `isOk` function calculates the values of `l` and `r` in each iteration of the loop. However, these values only depend on the current value of `k` and the `x[i]` and `y[i]` values don't change. Therefore, we can calculate `l` and `r` outside the loop and update them only when necessary.

Step 5: Optimize the binary search.
- The binary search in the original program performs 100 iterations to find the desired value of `mid`. However, we can improve the efficiency of the search by using a more accurate stopping condition. Instead of a fixed number of iterations, we can stop the search when the difference between `l` and `r` becomes smaller than a certain threshold.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <cmath>
#include <cstdio>

using namespace std;

const int maxn = 2000 + 10;
double x[100000 + 10], y[100000 + 10];
int n;

bool isOk(long double k, long double& l, long double& r) {
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    if (y[i] > k * 2) {
      return false;
    }
    double tmp = sqrt(k * k - (k - y[i]) * (k - y[i]));
    l = max(l, (long double)(x[i] - tmp));
    r = min(r, (long double)(x[i] + tmp));
  }
  return l < r;
}

int main() {
  scanf("%d", &n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    scanf("%lf %lf", &x[i], &y[i]);
  }

  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    if (y[i] * y[n - 1] < 0) {
      printf("-1\n");
      return 0;
    } else {
      y[i] = abs(y[i]);
    }
  }

  long double l = 0, r = 100000000000000000.0;
  long double mid;

  while (r - l > 1e-10) {
    mid = (l + r) / 2.0;
    if (isOk(mid, l, r)) {
      r = mid;
    } else {
      l = mid;
    }
  }

  printf("%.10Lf\n", mid);

  return 0;
}
```
