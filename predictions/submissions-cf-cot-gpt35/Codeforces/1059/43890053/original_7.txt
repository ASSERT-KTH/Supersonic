To optimize the given program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary header files: The program includes several unnecessary header files that are not used. We can remove them to reduce the compilation time and memory usage.

2. Remove unused macros: There are two macros `line` and `mem` defined in the program, but they are not used anywhere. We can remove them.

3. Remove unused typedef: The typedef `ll` is defined as `long long`, but it is not used in the program. We can remove it.

4. Remove unnecessary constant variables: The program defines constant variables `inf` and `mod`, but they are not used. We can remove them.

5. Remove unnecessary variables and constants: The program defines `maxn` as 2010, but it is not used. We can remove it. Additionally, the program defines `n` as the number of points, but it is not used after the input. We can remove it.

6. Remove unnecessary header for C++ I/O: The program includes the `<cstdio>` header for `printf` and `scanf`, but it also includes `<iostream>` which provides similar functionality. We can remove `<cstdio>` to reduce the compilation time and memory usage.

7. Optimize the loop condition: The loop `for (int i = 1; i <= 100; i++)` can be modified to have a smaller number of iterations if the condition `isOk(mid)` is satisfied earlier. We can change it to `for (int i = 1; i <= 20; i++)` to reduce the number of iterations.

8. Avoid unnecessary calculation: The program calculates `mid` as `(l + r) / 2.0` before the loop, but it is overwritten in the first iteration of the loop. We can remove this calculation before the loop.

9. Use a more appropriate data type: The program uses `double` for the `x` and `y` arrays, which can be memory-consuming and may not be necessary for the given problem. We can change the data type to `float` to reduce memory usage.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <cmath>
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

const float inf = 1e9 + 7;
const int max_points = 100000;

float x[max_points], y[max_points];

bool isOk(float k) {
  float l = -inf, r = inf;
  
  for (int i = 0; i < max_points; i++) {
    if (y[i] > k * 2) {
      return false;
    }

    float tmp = sqrt(k * k - (k - y[i]) * (k - y[i]));
    l = max(l, x[i] - tmp);
    r = min(r, x[i] + tmp);
  }
  
  return l < r;
}

int main() {
  int n;
  cin >> n;

  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> x[i] >> y[i];
  }

  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    if (y[i] * y[n - 1] < 0) {
      cout << "-1\n";
      return 0;
    } else {
      y[i] = abs(y[i]);
    }
  }

  float l = 0, r = inf;
  float mid;

  for (int i = 1; i <= 20; i++) {
    mid = (l + r) / 2.0;

    if (isOk(mid)) {
      r = mid;
    } else {
      l = mid;
    }
  }

  cout << fixed;
  cout.precision(10);
  cout << mid << endl;

  return 0;
}
```
