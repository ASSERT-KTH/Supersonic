Optimization steps:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The program includes both `bits/stdc++.h` and `iostream`, which is redundant. We only need to include `iostream` for this program.

2. Avoid using `using namespace std`: Using the entire `std` namespace can lead to naming conflicts and make the code less readable. Instead, we can use the `std::` prefix for the required standard library functions and types.

3. Use more descriptive variable names: Variable names like `tc`, `k`, `n`, `h`, etc. are not very descriptive. It is better to use meaningful names that convey the purpose of the variable.

4. Use `vector` instead of fixed-sized arrays: Instead of using a fixed-sized array `h`, we can use a `std::vector` to dynamically allocate memory. This avoids potential stack overflow issues and allows for more flexibility in handling different input sizes.

5. Avoid unnecessary calculations: The program calculates the difference between the current height and the maximum height for each index in the `diff` array. However, this calculation is not needed. We can directly compare the current height with the maximum height and update the maximum height if necessary.

6. Use a single pass to calculate the sum: Instead of using a separate loop to calculate the sum of the differences in height, we can calculate the sum while updating the maximum height.

7. Simplify the loop to find the next index to increase height: The loop to find the next index to increase the height can be simplified by using a flag variable to determine if no further increase is possible. We can also remove the unnecessary check for the last index.

Here is the optimized C++ program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

int main() {
  int tc;
  std::cin >> tc;
  while (tc--) {
    long long k, sum = 0;
    int n;
    std::cin >> n >> k;
    std::vector<long long> h(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      std::cin >> h[i];
    }
    long long maax = h[n - 1];
    long long ans = -1;
    int flag = 0;
    for (int i = n - 2; i >= 0; i--) {
      if (h[i] < maax) {
        sum += maax - h[i];
        if (sum >= k) {
          ans = i + 1;
          break;
        }
      } else {
        maax = h[i];
      }
    }
    if (sum < k) {
      std::cout << "-1\n";
    } else {
      std::cout << ans << std::endl;
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```
