The given program can be optimized in the following steps:

1. Remove unnecessary include statements: The program includes both `<bits/stdc++.h>` and `<iostream>`, which is redundant. We can remove the `<iostream>` include statement as `<bits/stdc++.h>` already includes it.

2. Remove unnecessary variable: The variable `sum` is used to store the sum of elements in the `diff` array. Instead of calculating the sum separately, we can calculate it on the fly when needed.

3. Avoid unnecessary array initialization: The `diff` array is initialized with zeros using `ll diff[n] = {0};`. However, we can avoid this initialization and instead initialize `diff[n-1] = 0;` before the loop starts.

4. Optimize the calculation of `diff` array: The calculation of the `diff` array can be optimized by avoiding unnecessary checks and assignments. We can start the loop from `n-2` instead of `n-1` and remove the `continue` statement. If `h[i]` is not greater than `maax`, we can directly assign `diff[i] = maax - h[i];`.

5. Optimize the loop for finding the answer: The loop that finds the answer can be optimized by avoiding unnecessary checks and assignments. We can use a flag variable to indicate if the answer is found or not. Instead of breaking the loop when `flag` is 1, we can directly print the answer or `-1` based on the value of `flag` after the loop ends.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
#define ll long long int
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int tc;
  cin >> tc;
  while (tc--) {
    ll k;
    int n;
    cin >> n >> k;
    ll h[n];
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      cin >> h[i];
    }
    ll maax = h[n - 1];
    ll diff[n];
    diff[n - 1] = 0;
    for (int i = n - 2; i >= 0; i--) {
      if (h[i] <= maax) {
        diff[i] = maax - h[i];
      }
    }
    int flag = 0;
    ll ans;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      if (i != n - 1 && h[i] < h[i + 1]) {
        h[i]++;
        ans = i + 1;
        k--;
        if (k == 0) {
          flag = 1;
          break;
        }
      } else {
          flag = 1;
          break;
      }
    }
    if (flag == 1)
      cout << "-1\n";
    else
      cout << ans << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```
