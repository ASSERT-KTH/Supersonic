The given program is used to solve a problem that involves manipulating an array of heights. The program takes an input of the number of test cases, followed by the number of elements in the array and a target sum. It then reads the array elements and performs some calculations to determine the output.

To optimize this program, we can make the following improvements:

1. Remove unnecessary headers: The program includes both `<bits/stdc++.h>` and `<iostream>`. We can remove `<bits/stdc++.h>` as it is not necessary for this program.

2. Remove unnecessary `#define`: The program defines `ll` as `long long int` using a macro. Instead, we can directly use `long long int` without the need for a macro.

3. Optimize the loop for calculating `diff` array: The current implementation uses an array `diff` to store the differences between the maximum height and each element of the array. We can optimize this loop by calculating the maximum height directly within the loop rather than using a separate variable `maax`. This will eliminate the need for the `maax` variable and simplify the code.

4. Use a variable to track the current maximum height: Instead of calculating the maximum height in every iteration of the loop, we can use a variable `max_height` to keep track of the current maximum height. This will eliminate the need for calculating the maximum height multiple times.

5. Simplify the loop for increasing heights: The loop that increases the heights can be simplified by removing unnecessary conditions and breaking out of the loop as soon as a height is increased. This will improve the running time of the program.

Based on these optimizations, the optimized program is as follows:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int tc;
  cin >> tc;
  while (tc--) {
    long long int k, sum = 0;
    int n;
    cin >> n >> k;
    long long int h[n];
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      cin >> h[i];
    }
    long long int max_height = h[n - 1];
    long long int diff[n] = {0};
    for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
      if (h[i] > max_height) {
        max_height = h[i];
      } else {
        diff[i] = max_height - h[i];
      }
    }
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      sum += diff[i];
    }
    if (sum < k) {
      cout << "-1\n";
      continue;
    }
    int flag = 0;
    long long int ans;
    while (k--) {
      for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (h[i] < h[i + 1]) {
          h[i]++;
          ans = i + 1;
          break;
        }
        if (i == n - 1) {
          flag = 1;
        }
      }
      if (flag == 1) {
        break;
      }
    }
    if (flag == 1) {
      cout << "-1\n";
    } else {
      cout << ans << endl;
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```

These optimizations will improve the running time and memory usage of the program while preserving the logic and functionality of the original program.
