The given program is a solution to a problem that involves manipulating an array of heights. The goal is to increment the heights in such a way that the sum of the differences between adjacent heights is at least a certain value.

To optimize the program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary header files: The program includes both `<bits/stdc++.h>` and `<iostream>`. We can remove `<bits/stdc++.h>` as it includes all the standard library headers, making `<iostream>` redundant.

2. Remove unnecessary typedef: The program defines `ll` as `long long int`. However, `ll` is not used in the program, so we can remove the typedef.

3. Use dynamic memory allocation for the array `h`: The program currently uses a static array `h[n]`, where `n` is read from the input. This can be problematic if `n` is very large, as it may exceed the stack size. We can use dynamic memory allocation instead to avoid this issue.

4. Optimize the calculation of `diff`: The program calculates the differences between adjacent heights in a loop. However, we can optimize this calculation by initializing `maax` as the last element of `h` and then traversing the array in reverse. If a height is less than `maax`, we can calculate the difference and update `maax`. This way, we eliminate the need to store the differences in a separate array.

5. Optimize the height increment loop: The loop that increments the heights can be optimized by keeping track of the maximum height encountered so far. We can also use a flag to determine if all heights have reached their maximum value. This way, we can avoid unnecessary iterations when all heights are already at their maximum value.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  int tc;
  std::cin >> tc;
  while (tc--) {
    int n, k;
    std::cin >> n >> k;
    int* h = new int[n];
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      std::cin >> h[i];
    }
    int maax = h[n - 1];
    int sum = 0;
    int flag = 0;
    int ans;
    for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
      if (h[i] > maax) {
        maax = h[i];
      } else {
        sum += maax - h[i];
      }
    }
    if (sum < k) {
      std::cout << "-1\n";
      delete[] h;
      continue;
    }
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      if (i != n - 1 && h[i] < h[i + 1]) {
        h[i]++;
        ans = i + 1;
        break;
      } else {
        if (i == n - 1) {
          flag = 1;
        }
      }
      if (flag == 1) {
        break;
      }
    }
    if (flag == 1) {
      std::cout << "-1\n";
    } else {
      std::cout << ans << std::endl;
    }
    delete[] h;
  }
  return 0;
}
```

By making these optimizations, we have improved the running time and memory usage of the program.
