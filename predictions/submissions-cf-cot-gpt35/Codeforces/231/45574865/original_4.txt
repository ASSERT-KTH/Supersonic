The original program seems to be a simple program that reads input numbers and counts how many sets of numbers contain at least two ones (y = 1).

To optimize this program, we can make a few modifications:

1. Eliminate unnecessary header files: The program does not use any functions from the `math.h` and `string.h` libraries, so we can remove the `#include <math.h>` and `#include <string.h>` lines.

2. Avoid using `namespace std`: Instead of using `using namespace std;`, we can qualify the standard library functions with `std::` to avoid namespace pollution.

3. Avoid unnecessary variables: The variables `temp` and `hasil` are unnecessary. We can directly increment `hasil` whenever `temp` is greater than or equal to 2.

4. Optimize input loop: Instead of reading each number individually, we can read the numbers into an array in a single input operation. This can be done by using a nested loop to read the numbers into a two-dimensional array.

5. Optimize counting loop: Instead of using an additional variable `temp` to count the number of ones, we can directly check the condition inside the loop and increment `hasil` accordingly.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  int n;
  std::cin >> n;
  
  int sets[n][3];
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j < 3; j++) {
      std::cin >> sets[i][j];
    }
  }
  
  int hasil = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    if (sets[i][0] + sets[i][1] + sets[i][2] >= 2) {
      hasil++;
    }
  }
  
  std::cout << hasil;
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized program eliminates unnecessary variables and libraries, optimizes the input and counting loops, and maintains the same functionality as the original program.
