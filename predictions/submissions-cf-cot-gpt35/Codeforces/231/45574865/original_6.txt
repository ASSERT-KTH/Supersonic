The given program reads an integer `n` from the user and then reads `n` groups of 3 integers. For each group, it counts the number of occurrences of the integer 1 and increments a counter `hasil` if the count is greater than or equal to 2. Finally, it prints the value of `hasil`.

To optimize this program, we can make the following changes:

1. Get rid of unnecessary header files: The program does not use any functions or constants from the `math.h` or `string.h` header files. Therefore, we can remove those include statements.

2. Avoid using `using namespace std;`: This statement brings all the names from the `std` namespace into the global namespace, which can lead to naming conflicts. It is better to explicitly qualify the names from the `std` namespace (e.g., `std::cout`, `std::cin`) to avoid potential issues.

3. Use more meaningful variable names: The variables `n`, `temp`, and `hasil` do not convey their purpose clearly. We can use more descriptive names to improve code readability.

4. Avoid unnecessary variable initialization: The variable `temp` is initialized to 0 before the loop, but it is always reset to 0 at the beginning of each iteration of the outer loop. We can remove the initial assignment.

5. Optimize the counting logic: Instead of counting the number of occurrences of 1 in each group, we can use a more efficient approach. We can check if at least two out of the three numbers in a group are equal to 1. If true, we increment the counter `result`. This avoids the need for an inner loop and reduces the number of conditional checks.

Here is the optimized C++ program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  int numGroups, result = 0;
  std::cin >> numGroups;

  for (int i = 0; i < numGroups; i++) {
    int a, b, c;
    std::cin >> a >> b >> c;

    if (a + b + c >= 2) {
      result++;
    }
  }

  std::cout << result;

  return 0;
}
```
