The given program reads an integer `n`, followed by `n` sets of three integers. For each set, it counts the number of occurrences of the integer `1` and increments a counter `hasil` if the count is greater than or equal to 2. Finally, it prints the value of `hasil`.

To optimize this program, we can eliminate the unnecessary inclusion of header files `<math.h>` and `<string.h>`. Additionally, we can remove the use of the `temp` variable and update the `hasil` condition check inside the loop to improve efficiency.

Here's the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int n, hasil = 0;
  cin >> n;
  
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    int count = 0;
    for (int j = 0; j < 3; j++) {
      int y;
      cin >> y;
      if (y == 1) {
        count++;
      }
    }
    if (count > 1) {
      hasil++;
    }
  }
  
  cout << hasil;
  return 0;
}
```

Explanation of optimizations:
1. Removed unnecessary header files `<math.h>` and `<string.h>`.
2. Removed the `temp` variable and replaced it with `count` inside the loop. This eliminates the need to reset `temp` to zero in each iteration.
3. Updated the condition check to `count > 1` instead of `temp >= 2`. Since we are counting the occurrences of `1`, it is sufficient to check if `count` is greater than 1. This eliminates the need for the `>=` operator and improves efficiency.
