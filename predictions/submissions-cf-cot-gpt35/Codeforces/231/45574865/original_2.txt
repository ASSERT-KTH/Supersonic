The given program reads an integer `n` from the user and then reads `n` sets of 3 integers. It counts the number of sets that have at least 2 occurrences of the number 1 and prints the count.

To optimize this program, we can eliminate the unnecessary use of the `math.h` and `string.h` libraries since they are not being used in the program. Additionally, we can remove the `using namespace std` statement and replace it with explicit namespace specification to avoid potential naming conflicts.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  int n, temp = 0, hasil = 0;
  std::cin >> n;
  int y;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j < 3; j++) {
      std::cin >> y;
      if (y == 1) {
        temp++;
      }
    }
    if (temp >= 2) {
      hasil++;
    }
    temp = 0;
  }
  std::cout << hasil;
  return 0;
}
```

Explanation:
- Removed the unnecessary `#include <math.h>` and `#include <string.h>` statements.
- Removed the `using namespace std` statement and replaced it with explicit namespace specification (`std::cin`, `std::cout`) to avoid potential naming conflicts.
