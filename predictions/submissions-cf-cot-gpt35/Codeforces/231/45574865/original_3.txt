The given program reads an integer `n` from the user, and then reads `n` groups of three integers. For each group, it counts the number of occurrences of the integer `1` and increments `hasil` if the count is greater than or equal to `2`. Finally, it prints the value of `hasil`.

To optimize this program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary header files: The program does not use any functions from the `math.h` and `string.h` header files. Therefore, we can remove the `#include <math.h>` and `#include <string.h>` lines.

2. Avoid using `using namespace std;`: This statement brings all names from the `std` namespace into the global namespace, which can lead to naming conflicts. Instead, we can use the `std::` prefix for specific names, such as `std::cin` and `std::cout`.

3. Initialize variables inside the loop: The variables `temp` and `hasil` are reset to `0` inside the loop, which is unnecessary. We can move the initialization outside the loop.

4. Use a more descriptive variable name: The variable `y` is not a meaningful name. We can rename it to `input`.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  int n;
  std::cin >> n;

  int hasil = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    int temp = 0;
    for (int j = 0; j < 3; j++) {
      int input;
      std::cin >> input;
      if (input == 1) {
        temp++;
      }
    }
    if (temp >= 2) {
      hasil++;
    }
  }

  std::cout << hasil;
  return 0;
}
```
