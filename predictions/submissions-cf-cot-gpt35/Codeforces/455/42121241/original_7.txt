The given program is a C++ program that performs various operations on a data structure called `dat`. The `dat` structure is implemented using a deque and a map. The program reads input from the user and performs insertions, deletions, and counts based on the user's input.

To optimize this program for running time and memory usage, we can make the following modifications:

1. Change the `count` function to use an iterator-based loop instead of an index-based loop. This will remove the need for repeatedly calling the `[]` operator on the `deque` and improve the performance.

2. Change the `insert` function to use the `emplace` function of the `deque` instead of the `insert` function. This will avoid unnecessary copies of the inserted element and improve the performance.

3. Change the `erase` function to use the `erase` function of the `deque` instead of manually erasing the element using an iterator. This will simplify the code and improve the performance.

4. Change the `split` function to only split the `dat` structure if the size is greater than or equal to `n` instead of `n << 1`. This will reduce the number of splits and improve the performance.

5. Change the `merge` function to only merge the `dat` structure if the size is less than or equal to `n` instead of checking if the size is greater than `n`. This will reduce the number of merges and improve the performance.

6. Use `std::unique_ptr` instead of raw pointers to manage memory for the `dat` structures. This will simplify memory management and improve the memory usage.

7. Remove the unnecessary inclusion of `<algorithm>` and `<cmath>` headers as they are not used in the program.

8. Remove the unnecessary `static int n` declaration in the `dat` structure as it is already declared as a member variable.

9. Remove the unnecessary `fprintf(stderr, ...)` calls in the `print` function as they are not used in the program.

Based on these optimizations, the optimized C++ program is as follows:
