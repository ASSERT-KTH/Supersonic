To optimize this program for running time and memory usage, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary header files: The program includes `<algorithm>`, `<cmath>`, and `<deque>`, but these header files are not used in the program. We can remove them to improve compilation time.

2. Remove unnecessary `static` variable: The `n` variable in the `dat` struct is declared as `static`, but it is not necessary. We can remove the `static` keyword and pass `n` as a parameter to the `dat` constructor.

3. Use `std::vector` instead of `std::deque`: The `A` member variable in the `dat` struct is declared as a `deque`, but we can use a `vector` instead. This change will improve memory usage and also make the program faster because `vector` has better cache locality.

4. Use `std::unordered_map` instead of `std::map`: The `M` member variable in the `dat` struct is declared as a `map`, but we can use an `unordered_map` instead. This change will improve the performance of the `count`, `insert`, `erase`, `push_back`, `push_front`, `pop_back`, `pop_front`, and `merge` functions.

5. Avoid unnecessary copying: In the `count` function, we can avoid unnecessary copying of the `A` vector by using a const reference. This change will improve the performance of the `count` function.

6. Avoid unnecessary splitting and merging: In the `insert` and `erase` functions, we can avoid unnecessary splitting and merging of the data structure. This change will improve the performance of the `insert` and `erase` functions.

7. Use `reserve` function for vector resizing: In the `main` function, we can use the `reserve` function to pre-allocate memory for the vectors to avoid frequent reallocations. This change will improve the performance of the program.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <cstdio>

    if (p > size()) {
      auto it = M.find(x);
      if (it == M.end())
        return next->count(p - size(), x);
      else
        return next->count(p - size(), x) + it->second;
    }
    int ans = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < p; i++)
      ans += A[i] == x;
    return ans;
  }

  void insert(int p, int x) {
    if (p > size()) {

  int size() const { return A.size(); }

  void split() {

    while (size() > n)
      tmp->push_front(pop_back());
    tmp->next = next;
    next = tmp;
  }

  void merge() {
    dat* tmp = next;
    while (next->size() > 0)
      push_back(tmp->pop_front());
    next = tmp->next;
    delete tmp;
  }

  void print() const {
    for (int x : A)
      fprintf(stderr, "%3d", x);
    if (next == nullptr)
      fprintf(stderr, "\n");
    else
      next->print();
  }
};

int main() {
  int n, m, last = 0;
  scanf("%d", &n);
  int sqrt_n = ceil(sqrt(n << 2));

  dat* cur = D;

  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    if (cur->size() >= sqrt_n) {
      cur->next = new dat(sqrt_n);
      cur = cur->next;
    }
    int x;

    cur->push_back(x);
  }
  scanf("%d", &m);
  for (; m > 0; m--) {
    int op, l, r, k;
    scanf("%d", &op);
    scanf(op == 1 ? "%d%d" : "%d%d%d", &l, &r, &k);
    l = (l + last - 1) % n + 1;
    r = (r + last - 1) % n + 1;

Explanation of the optimizations:

1. Removed unnecessary header files: The program did not use the `<algorithm>`, `<cmath>`, and `<deque>` header files, so they were removed.

2. Removed unnecessary `static` variable: The `n` variable in the `dat` struct was declared as `static`, but it was not necessary. It was changed to a non-static member variable and passed as a parameter to the `dat` constructor.

3. Used `std::vector` instead of `std::deque`: The `A` member variable in the `dat` struct was changed from a `deque` to a `vector`. This change improves memory usage and performance.

4. Used `std::unordered_map` instead of `std::map`: The `M` member variable in the `dat` struct was changed from a `map` to an `unordered_map`. This change improves the performance of the `count`, `insert`, `erase`, `push_back`, `push_front`, `pop_back`, `pop_front`, and `merge` functions.

5. Avoided unnecessary copying: In the `count` function, the `A` vector was changed to a const reference to avoid unnecessary copying.

6. Avoided unnecessary splitting and merging: In the `insert` and `erase` functions, splitting and merging were only performed when necessary, i.e., when the size of the data structure exceeded `n << 1`.

7. Used `reserve` function for vector resizing: In the `main` function, the `reserve` function was used to pre-allocate memory for the vectors to avoid frequent reallocations. This change improves the performance of the program.
