Step 1: Avoid unnecessary use of headers
- The program is including unnecessary headers such as `<algorithm>` and `<cmath>`.
- Since these headers are not being used in the program, they can be removed.

Step 2: Remove unnecessary `using namespace std;` statement
- The program has a `using namespace std;` statement which can be removed.
- It is generally considered a good practice to avoid using `using namespace std;` in global scope.

Step 3: Remove unnecessary `struct dat`
- The `dat` struct is not being used as a struct and can be converted into a regular class.
- The `static int n` member of the `dat` struct is not being used and can be removed.

Step 4: Improve memory usage in `count` function
- The `count` function is using a recursive approach to calculate the count of a given element.
- Instead of using recursion, we can use a loop to calculate the count.
- This will reduce the memory usage as we won't have multiple function calls on the stack.

Step 5: Improve memory usage in `insert` function
- The `insert` function is using the recursive `split` function which splits the data into smaller chunks.
- Instead of using recursion, we can use a loop to split the data.
- This will reduce the memory usage as we won't have multiple function calls on the stack.

Step 6: Improve memory usage in `erase` function
- The `erase` function is using the recursive `merge` function which merges adjacent chunks of data.
- Instead of using recursion, we can use a loop to merge the data.
- This will reduce the memory usage as we won't have multiple function calls on the stack.

Step 7: Remove unnecessary `fprintf` statement
- The `print` function is using `fprintf` to print the elements of the data structure.
- Since the `print` function is not being used in the program, we can remove it.
