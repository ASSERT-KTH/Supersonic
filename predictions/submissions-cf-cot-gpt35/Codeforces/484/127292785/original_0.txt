Step 1: Remove unnecessary headers
- The program includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header, which is a non-standard header and includes a large number of headers unnecessarily. We can remove this line and include only the necessary headers.

Step 2: Remove unnecessary pragmas
- The program includes several `#pragma` directives that are meant to optimize the program for specific CPU instructions and compiler optimizations. However, these directives are not necessary for the given program and can be removed.

Step 3: Remove unnecessary typedefs and macros
- The program includes several typedefs and macros that are not used. We can remove these to simplify the code.

Step 4: Remove unnecessary functions and data structures
- The program includes a `SparseTable` data structure that is not necessary for the given problem. We can remove this data structure and the related code.

Step 5: Simplify the loop conditions
- The loop conditions in the `for` loops can be simplified to improve readability.

Step 6: Optimize the `for` loop for calculating `maxi`
- The `for` loop that calculates the `maxi` value can be optimized to avoid unnecessary iterations. We can modify the loop to iterate only up to `R/i` instead of `R+1`.

Here is the optimized C++ program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

void solve() {
  int R = 1e6;
  vector<int> a(R + 5, 0);
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    int x;
    cin >> x;
    a[x] = x;
  }
  int maxi = 0;
  for (int i = 2; i < R + 1; i++) {
    if (!a[i])
      continue;
    for (int j = i; j <= R / i; j++) {
      int temp = a[j * i] - j;
      maxi = max(maxi, temp);
    }
  }
  cout << maxi << endl;
}

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  
  int test = 1;
  while (test--) {
    solve();
  }
}
```
