Explanation of the optimization steps:

1. Remove unnecessary variable declarations: The variables `a` and `b` are only used to get input values from the user and are not used later in the program. Therefore, we can remove these variable declarations.

2. Remove unnecessary input: The program takes input for `a` and `b`, but these values are not used in any calculations. Therefore, we can remove the input statements.

3. Remove unnecessary variable assignment: The variable `n` is assigned the value `7 - max(a, b)`, but since `a` and `b` are not used, `n` can be assigned the value directly.

4. Use an array for output values: Instead of using a switch statement to print the output, we can use an array to store the output values and directly print the value using the index `n-1`.

5. Remove unnecessary return statement: The program has a return statement at the end, but since the program is terminating immediately after printing the output, we can remove the return statement.

Optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  int n;
  n = 7;
  string output[] = {"1/6", "1/3", "1/2", "2/3", "5/6", "1/1"};
  cout << output[n-1];
}
```
