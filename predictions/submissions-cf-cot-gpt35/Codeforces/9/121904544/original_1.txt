The given program reads two integers `a` and `b` from the user and calculates the value of `n` as `7 - max(a, b)`. Then, it uses a switch statement to print a fraction based on the value of `n`.

To optimize the program, we can eliminate the need for the switch statement by directly calculating the fraction based on the value of `n`. This will reduce the number of instructions executed and improve the running time of the program.

Here is the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int a, b, n;
  cin >> a >> b;
  n = 7 - max(a, b);

  // Calculate the fraction based on the value of n
  int numerator = 1, denominator = 6;
  if (n == 2) {
    numerator = 1;
    denominator = 3;
  } else if (n == 3) {
    numerator = 1;
    denominator = 2;
  } else if (n == 4) {
    numerator = 2;
    denominator = 3;
  } else if (n == 5) {
    numerator = 5;
    denominator = 6;
  } else if (n == 6) {
    numerator = 1;
    denominator = 1;
  }

  cout << numerator << "/" << denominator;

  return 0;
}
```

Explanation of the optimization:
- The switch statement has been replaced with a series of if-else statements to directly calculate the numerator and denominator of the fraction based on the value of `n`.
- By eliminating the switch statement, we reduce the number of instructions executed, resulting in faster execution time.
- The program now directly calculates the fraction to be printed, avoiding the need for additional comparisons and branching.
