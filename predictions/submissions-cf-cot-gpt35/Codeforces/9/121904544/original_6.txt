The given program reads two integers from the input, calculates `n` as `7 - max(a, b)`, and then uses a switch statement to print a fraction based on the value of `n`.

To optimize this program for running time and memory usage, we can eliminate the need for the switch statement and directly calculate the fraction to print based on the value of `n`.

Here are the steps to optimize the program:

1. Remove the switch statement and all the case statements.

2. Calculate the numerator and denominator of the fraction directly based on the value of `n`.

3. Print the fraction using the calculated numerator and denominator.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int a, b, n;
  cin >> a >> b;
  n = 7 - max(a, b);

  int numerator, denominator;

  if (n == 1) {
    numerator = 1;
    denominator = 6;
  } else if (n == 2) {
    numerator = 1;
    denominator = 3;
  } else if (n == 3) {
    numerator = 1;
    denominator = 2;
  } else if (n == 4) {
    numerator = 2;
    denominator = 3;
  } else if (n == 5) {
    numerator = 5;
    denominator = 6;
  } else if (n == 6) {
    numerator = 1;
    denominator = 1;
  }

  cout << numerator << "/" << denominator;

  return 0;
}
```

In this optimized program, we directly calculate the numerator and denominator of the fraction based on the value of `n`, and then print the fraction using these calculated values. This eliminates the need for the switch statement and reduces the number of instructions executed, resulting in improved running time and memory usage.
