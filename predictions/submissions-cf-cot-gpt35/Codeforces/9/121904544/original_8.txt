The given program calculates a value `n` based on inputs `a` and `b`, and then uses a switch statement to print a corresponding fraction based on the value of `n`.

To optimize this program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove the `using namespace std;` statement and instead use the `std::` prefix for standard library functions and objects. This will avoid polluting the global namespace.

2. Instead of calculating `n` as `7 - max(a, b)`, we can directly calculate the corresponding fraction using a formula. By observing the pattern in the output, we can see that the numerator is always `7 - max(a, b)`, and the denominator is always `6`. So, we can simply calculate the numerator and output the fraction.

3. Removing the switch statement will eliminate unnecessary branching and improve the running time.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  int a, b;
  std::cin >> a >> b;
  
  int numerator = 7 - std::max(a, b);
  std::cout << numerator << "/6";
  
  return 0;
}
```

Explanation of the optimization:

1. By directly calculating the numerator, we avoid the need for the switch statement and reduce the number of calculations needed.

2. Removing the `using namespace std;` statement helps avoid namespace conflicts and makes the code more explicit.

3. Since the denominator is always `6`, we can directly output it without any calculations or branching.

These optimizations improve the running time and memory usage of the program.
