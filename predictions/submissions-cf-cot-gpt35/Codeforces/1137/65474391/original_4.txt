To optimize the given C/C++ program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary `#include` statements: The program includes unnecessary `#include` statements for the `<map>`, `<queue>`, and `<set>` libraries. Since these libraries are not used in the program, we can remove these statements.

2. Remove unnecessary preprocessor macro: The program defines a preprocessor macro `fi` and `se` using `#define`, but these macros are not used anywhere in the program. We can remove these macros.

3. Replace `vector<int>` with `int[]`: The program uses `vector<int>` to represent adjacency lists for each node. However, since the maximum number of nodes is known in advance, we can replace `vector<int>` with `int[]` to optimize memory usage. This will eliminate the need for dynamic memory allocation and improve memory efficiency.

4. Replace `map<int, int>` with `int[]`: The program uses `map<int, int>` to store color information for each node. However, since the maximum number of nodes is known in advance, we can replace `map<int, int>` with `int[]` to optimize memory usage. This will eliminate the need for dynamic memory allocation and improve memory efficiency.

5. Replace `map<int, set<int>>` with `set<int>[]`: The program uses `map<int, set<int>>` to store position information for each color in each chain. However, since the maximum number of chains and colors is known in advance, we can replace `map<int, set<int>>` with `set<int>[]` to optimize memory usage. This will eliminate the need for dynamic memory allocation and improve memory efficiency.

6. Replace `vector<int> chain[MAXN]` with `int chain[MAXN][MAXN]`: The program uses `vector<int> chain[MAXN]` to store the chains for each node. However, since the maximum number of nodes and the maximum size of a chain is known in advance, we can replace `vector<int> chain[MAXN]` with `int chain[MAXN][MAXN]` to optimize memory usage. This will eliminate the need for dynamic memory allocation and improve memory efficiency.

7. Replace `priority_queue<int> pq` with `int pq[MAXN]`: The program uses `priority_queue<int> pq` to store the nodes with only one adjacent node. However, since the maximum number of nodes is known in advance, we can replace `priority_queue<int> pq` with `int pq[MAXN]` to optimize memory usage. This will eliminate the need for dynamic memory allocation and improve memory efficiency.

8. Replace `map<int, int>::iterator` with `int`: The program uses `map<int, int>::iterator` to iterate over elements in a map. However, since we are only interested in the keys of the map, we can replace `map<int, int>::iterator` with `int` to optimize memory usage. This will eliminate the need for dynamic memory allocation and improve memory efficiency.

9. Replace `map<int, set<int>>::iterator` with `int`: The program uses `map<int, set<int>>::iterator` to iterate over elements in a map of sets. However, since we are only interested in the keys of the map, we can replace `map<int, set<int>>::iterator` with `int` to optimize memory usage. This will eliminate the need for dynamic memory allocation and improve memory efficiency.

10. Replace `map<int, int>::lower_bound` with `int`: The program uses `map<int, int>::lower_bound` to find the lower bound of a value in a map. However, since we are only interested in the keys of the map, we can replace `map<int, int>::lower_bound` with `int` to optimize memory usage. This will eliminate the need for dynamic memory allocation and improve memory efficiency.

11. Replace `map<int, set<int>>::lower_bound` with `int`: The program uses `map<int, set<int>>::lower_bound` to find the lower bound of a value in a map of sets. However, since we are only interested in the keys of the map, we can replace `map<int, set<int>>::lower_bound` with `int` to optimize memory usage. This will eliminate the need for dynamic memory allocation and improve memory efficiency.

12. Replace `map<int, int>::begin` with `int`: The program uses `map<int, int>::begin` to get the iterator to the beginning of a map. However, since we are only interested in the keys of the map, we can replace `map<int, int>::begin` with `int` to optimize memory usage. This will eliminate the need for dynamic memory allocation and improve memory efficiency.

13. Replace `map<int, set<int>>::begin` with `int`: The program uses `map<int, set<int>>::begin` to get the iterator to the beginning of a map of sets. However, since we are only interested in the keys of the map, we can replace `map<int, set<int>>::begin` with `int` to optimize memory usage. This will eliminate the need for dynamic memory allocation and improve memory efficiency.

14. Replace `map<int, int>::erase` with `int`: The program uses `map<int, int>::erase` to erase elements from a map. However, since we are only interested in the keys of the map, we can replace `map<int, int>::erase` with `int` to optimize memory usage. This will eliminate the need for dynamic memory allocation and improve memory efficiency.

15. Replace `map<int, set<int>>::erase` with `int`: The program uses `map<int, set<int>>::erase` to erase elements from a map of sets. However, since we are only interested in the keys of the map, we can replace `map<int, set<int>>::erase` with `int` to optimize memory usage. This will eliminate the need for dynamic memory allocation and improve memory efficiency.

16. Replace `map<int, set<int>>::count` with `bool`: The program uses `map<int, set<int>>::count` to check if a key exists in a map of sets. However, since we are only interested in checking if the key exists or not, we can replace `map<int, set<int>>::count` with `bool` to optimize memory usage. This will eliminate the need for dynamic memory allocation and improve memory efficiency.

17. Replace `map<int, int>::find` with `int`: The program uses `map<int, int>::find` to find an element in a map. However, since we are only interested in the keys of the map, we can replace `map<int, int>::find` with `int` to optimize memory usage. This will eliminate the need for dynamic memory allocation and improve memory efficiency.

18. Replace `set<int>::size` with `int`: The program uses `set<int>::size` to get the size of a set. However, since we are only interested in the size of the set, we can replace `set<int>::size` with `int` to optimize memory usage. This will eliminate the need for dynamic memory allocation and improve memory efficiency.

19. Replace `set<int>::insert` with `int`: The program uses `set<int>::insert` to insert an element into a set. However, since we are only interested in inserting elements into the set, we can replace `set<int>::insert` with `int` to optimize memory usage. This will eliminate the need for dynamic memory allocation and improve memory efficiency.

20. Replace `set<int>::find` with `int`: The program uses `set<int>::find` to find an element in a set. However, since we are only interested in finding elements in the set, we can replace `set<int>::find` with `int` to optimize memory usage. This will eliminate the need for dynamic memory allocation and improve memory efficiency.

21. Replace `set<int>::erase` with `int`: The program uses `set<int>::erase` to erase an element from a set. However, since we are only interested in erasing elements from the set, we can replace `set<int>::erase` with `int` to optimize memory usage. This will eliminate the need for dynamic memory allocation and improve memory efficiency.

22. Replace `update` function with `update` macro: The program uses a `update` function to update values in the `bit` array. However, function calls have an overhead in terms of time and memory. We can replace the `update` function with a `update` macro to optimize the program for running time.

23. Replace `query` function with `query` macro: The program uses a `query` function to calculate the sum of values in the `bit` array. However, function calls have an overhead in terms of time and memory. We can replace the `query` function with a `query` macro to optimize the program for running time.

24. Remove unnecessary `
