Optimization Steps:
1. Avoid unnecessary memory allocations: The initial code uses `map` and `set` extensively, which can lead to slow performance due to memory allocations and deallocations. We can replace `map` and `set` with arrays and vectors, which will improve the performance.

2. Reduce unnecessary function calls: The initial code calls the `count` function multiple times within the `when` function. We can optimize it by calculating the count only once and storing it in a variable.

3. Avoid redundant code: The initial code has some redundant code that can be removed to improve readability and performance.

4. Use a more efficient data structure: The initial code uses a binary indexed tree (`bit`) to store and query the counts. We can optimize it further by using a segment tree instead.

5. Optimize the LCA calculation: The initial code uses a binary search to find the LCA. We can optimize it by using a more efficient algorithm, such as Tarjan's algorithm or Euler Tour technique.

6. Optimize the `up` function: The initial code has a loop in the `up` function, which iterates over the chains. We can optimize it by directly calculating the position of the node in the chain using the depth and index.

7. Remove unnecessary variables: The initial code has some unnecessary variables that can be removed to improve memory usage.
