The given C/C++ program seems to be a solution to a coding problem. 

To optimize the program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary header file inclusion: The program includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header file, which includes a lot of unnecessary standard library headers. We can remove this and include only the required headers.

2. Remove unnecessary macros: The program defines several macros that are not used. We can remove these macros to simplify the code.

3. Remove unnecessary templates: The program defines several template functions that are not used. We can remove these template functions to simplify the code.

4. Use `'\n'` instead of `endl`: The `endl` manipulator flushes the output stream, which can be expensive. We can use the `'\n'` character instead, which only inserts a newline character.

5. Replace `cout` with `printf`: The `cout` object in C++ can be slower than `printf` in some cases. We can replace the `cout` statements with `printf` statements for faster output.

Here is the optimized C++ program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

void solve() {
  long long n, d;
  cin >> n >> d;
  if (d <= n) {
    printf("YES\n");
    return;
  }
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    long long q = ((d - 1) / (i + 1)) + 1;
    long long t = i + q;
    if (t <= n) {
      printf("YES\n");
      return;
    }
  }
  printf("NO\n");
}

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  cout.tie(NULL);
  
  int t;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--)
    solve();
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized program removes unnecessary code and makes small modifications to improve running time and memory usage.
