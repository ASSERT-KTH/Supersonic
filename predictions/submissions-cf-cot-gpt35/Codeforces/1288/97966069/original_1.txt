To optimize the given C/C++ program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary header files: The program includes the header file `<bits/stdc++.h>`, which includes all standard library headers. This can result in increased compile time and unnecessary memory usage. We can replace it with the specific headers that are actually used in the program.

2. Remove unnecessary macros: The program defines several macros that are not used. We can remove these macros to simplify the code.

3. Remove unnecessary template functions: The program defines several template functions `pe()` and `ps()` that are not used. We can remove these functions to simplify the code.

4. Avoid unnecessary variable redeclaration: The program declares a variable `t` outside the `solve()` function and then redeclares it inside the `main()` function. We can avoid this redeclaration and use a single `t` variable.

5. Use more descriptive variable names: The variable names `n`, `d`, `q`, and `t` are not very descriptive. We can rename these variables to make the code more readable.

With these optimizations in mind, here is the optimized C/C++ program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

void solve() {
  long long numberOfElements, divisor;
  cin >> numberOfElements >> divisor;
  
  if (divisor <= numberOfElements) {
    cout << "YES" << endl;
    return;
  }
  
  for (int i = 1; i <= numberOfElements; i++) {
    long long quotient = ((divisor - 1) / (i + 1)) + 1;
    long long total = i + quotient;
    if (total <= numberOfElements) {
      cout << "YES" << endl;
      return;
    }
  }
  
  cout << "NO" << endl;
}

int main() {
  int numberOfTestCases;
  cin >> numberOfTestCases;
  
  while (numberOfTestCases--) {
    solve();
  }
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized program removes unnecessary code and simplifies the variable names, making the program more readable and efficient.
