The given program is a C++ program that reads an integer `t` from the input, and then for each `t`, it reads two integers `n` and `d` from the input. It then checks if there exists a positive integer `q` such that `q` is less than or equal to `n` and `(q + i)` is less than or equal to `n`, where `i` is a positive integer less than or equal to `n`. If such a `q` exists, it prints "YES", otherwise it prints "NO".

To optimize the program for running time and memory usage, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The program includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header file, which is not a standard C++ header file and includes a large number of other header files. We can remove this include statement and include only the necessary header files.

2. Remove unnecessary macros: The program defines a number of macros that are not used in the program. We can remove these macros to simplify the code.

3. Remove unnecessary template functions: The program defines a number of template functions (`pe`, `ps`) that are not used in the program. We can remove these template functions to simplify the code.

4. Replace `endl` with `'\n'`: The program uses `endl` to output a new line to the console. However, `endl` flushes the output buffer, which can be expensive in terms of performance. We can replace `endl` with `'\n'` to only output a new line without flushing the output buffer.

5. Optimize the loop: The program uses a loop from `1` to `n` to check if there exists a positive integer `q` that satisfies the condition. However, we can optimize the loop by starting from `n` and decrementing `n` in each iteration. This way, we can break out of the loop as soon as we find a valid `q`, instead of iterating through all the values of `i`.

Here's the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

void solve() {
  long long n, d;
  cin >> n >> d;
  if (d <= n) {
    cout << "YES\n";
    return;
  }
  for (long long i = n; i >= 1; i--) {
    long long q = ((d - 1) / (i + 1)) + 1;
    long long t = i + q;
    if (t <= n) {
      cout << "YES\n";
      return;
    }
  }
  cout << "NO\n";
}

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  cout.tie(NULL);

  int t;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--)
    solve();

  return 0;
}
```

Explanation of optimization steps:

1. Removed unnecessary includes: The unnecessary `bits/stdc++.h` header file is removed.

2. Removed unnecessary macros: The unnecessary macros are removed to simplify the code.

3. Removed unnecessary template functions: The unnecessary template functions are removed to simplify the code.

4. Replaced `endl` with `'\n'`: The `endl` is replaced with `'\n'` to improve performance by avoiding unnecessary flushing of the output buffer.

5. Optimized the loop: The loop is optimized by starting from `n` and decrementing `n` in each iteration. This way, the loop can be terminated as soon as a valid `q` is found, instead of iterating through all values of `i`.
