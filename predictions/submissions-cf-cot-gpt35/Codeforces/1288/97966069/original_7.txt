The given program seems to calculate whether it is possible to reach a certain number `d` by adding any two numbers `i` and `q`, where `i` ranges from 1 to `n` and `q` is calculated as `((d - 1) / (i + 1)) + 1`.

To optimize the program, we can make the following modifications:
1. Remove unnecessary includes: The program includes the entire `<bits/stdc++.h>` library, which is not necessary. We can remove this include statement.
2. Remove unnecessary macros: The program defines macros for various operations, such as `p`, `pb`, `PB`, `mp`, etc. These macros are not used in the program and can be removed.
3. Remove unnecessary template functions: The program defines multiple template functions for printing different number of arguments. However, these functions are not used in the program and can be removed.
4. Remove unnecessary `using` statement: The program uses `using namespace std;`, which is considered a bad practice. We can remove this statement.
5. Remove unnecessary `endl` and `cout` statements: The program makes use of `endl` and multiple `cout` statements for printing. However, these statements can be replaced with a single `printf` statement for better performance.
6. Optimize the loop: The loop in the `solve` function can be optimized. Instead of iterating from 1 to `n`, we can iterate from `n` to 1. This is because the condition `t <= n` is satisfied only when `t` is equal to `n`. So, we can start the loop from `n` and decrement `i` in each iteration. This will reduce unnecessary iterations.

Here is the optimized C++ program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#define ll long long

void solve() {
  ll n, d;
  std::cin >> n >> d;
  if (d <= n) {
    printf("YES\n");
    return;
  }
  for (ll i = n; i >= 1; i--) {
    ll q = ((d - 1) / (i + 1)) + 1;
    ll t = i + q;
    if (t <= n) {
      printf("YES\n");
      return;
    }
  }
  printf("NO\n");
}

int main() {
  int t;
  std::cin >> t;
  while (t--)
    solve();
  return 0;
}
```

The optimized program removes unnecessary includes, macros, template functions, and statements. It also optimizes the loop to start from `n` and decrement `i`.
