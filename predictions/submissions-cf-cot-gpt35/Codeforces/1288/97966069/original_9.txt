The given program can be optimized in the following steps:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The program includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header, which is not a standard C++ header and can slow down the compilation process. Instead, we can include the necessary standard headers individually.

2. Remove unnecessary macros: The program defines several macros that are not used in the code. We can remove these macros to improve code readability.

3. Remove unnecessary template functions: The program defines multiple template functions for printing output, but these functions are not used in the code. We can remove these template functions to reduce code size and improve compilation time.

4. Replace `endl` with `'\n'`: The program uses `endl` to print a new line, which flushes the output buffer in addition to printing a new line. This can cause a slowdown in the program. We can replace `endl` with `'\n'` to only print a new line without flushing the output buffer.

5. Replace `cout` with `printf`: The program uses `cout` for printing output, which can be slower than using `printf` from the C standard library. We can replace `cout` with `printf` for better performance.

6. Optimize the loop condition: The program uses a loop to check if a condition is true for a range of values. However, we can optimize the loop condition to improve performance. Instead of checking the condition for all values in the range, we can calculate the maximum value that satisfies the condition and then check if the target value is less than or equal to the maximum value.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  cout.tie(NULL);

  int t;
  cin >> t;
  
  while (t--) {
    long long n, d;
    cin >> n >> d;

    if (d <= n) {
      printf("YES\n");
      continue;
    }

    long long max_q = (d - 1) / 2;
    long long max_t = max_q + 1;
    if (max_t <= n) {
      printf("YES\n");
      continue;
    }

    printf("NO\n");
  }

  return 0;
}
```

Explanation of optimizations:

1. Removed unnecessary includes: Instead of including the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header, we include the necessary standard headers `<iostream>`.

2. Removed unnecessary macros: The macros `ll`, `ld`, `p`, `pb`, `PB`, `mp`, `ii`, `vii`, `vi`, `F`, `S`, `max3`, and `min3` are not used in the code, so we remove them.

3. Removed unnecessary template functions: The template functions `pe` and `ps` are not used in the code, so we remove them.

4. Replaced `endl` with `'\n'`: Instead of using `endl` to print a new line, we use `'\n'` to only print a new line without flushing the output buffer.

5. Replaced `cout` with `printf`: We replace `cout` with `printf` for better performance.

6. Optimized the loop condition: Instead of checking the condition for all values in the range, we calculate the maximum value `max_t` that satisfies the condition and check if the target value `d` is less than or equal to `max_t`. This reduces the number of iterations in the loop and improves performance.
