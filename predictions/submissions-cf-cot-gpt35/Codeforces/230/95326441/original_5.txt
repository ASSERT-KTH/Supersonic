The given program calculates whether a given number is a perfect square and a prime number or not. 

To optimize the program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove the unnecessary headers: The `<bits/stdc++.h>` header includes a lot of unnecessary headers, which can slow down the compilation process. We only need the `iostream` and `cmath` headers for this program.

2. Replace the `endl` with a newline character: The `endl` manipulator flushes the output stream, which can be an unnecessary overhead. We can replace it with a simple newline character `'\n'`, which will not flush the stream.

3. Remove the unused `MOD` macro: The `MOD` macro is not used in the program, so we can remove it.

4. Use a more efficient algorithm for checking if a number is prime: The current algorithm uses the Sieve of Eratosthenes to generate all prime numbers up to a given limit. However, in this program, we only need to check if a single number is prime. We can use a more efficient algorithm like the trial division method to check if a number is prime.

5. Remove the unnecessary `trex` variable: The variable `trex` is used to store the square root of `a`, but it is not necessary. We can directly calculate the square root of `a` inside the `if` condition.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>

bool isPrime(long long n) {
  if (n <= 1) {
    return false;
  }
  for (long long i = 2; i * i <= n; i++) {
    if (n % i == 0) {
      return false;
    }
  }
  return true;
}

int main() {
  std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  std::cin.tie(NULL);

  int n;
  std::cin >> n;

  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    long long a;
    std::cin >> a;

    if (std::sqrt(a) == std::floor(std::sqrt(a)) && isPrime(std::sqrt(a))) {
      std::cout << "YES\n";
    } else {
      std::cout << "NO\n";
    }
  }

  return 0;
}
```

Explanation:

1. Removed the unnecessary headers `bits/stdc++.h` and `MOD`.

2. Replaced `endl` with `'\n'` in the `cout` statements.

3. Created a new function `isPrime` which checks if a given number is prime using the trial division method.

4. Removed the `trex` variable and directly calculated the square root of `a` inside the `if` condition using `std::sqrt` and checked if it is an integer using `std::floor`.

5. Removed the unused `sieve` function.
