To optimize the given program, we can make the following improvements:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The program includes `<bits/stdc++.h>` which includes a lot of unnecessary headers. We can remove this line and include only the necessary headers.

2. Avoid using `using namespace std;`: Using `using namespace std;` can lead to naming conflicts and make the code less readable. We can use the `std::` prefix instead.

3. Avoid using `#define` for constants: Instead of using `#define` for constants like `ll` and `MOD`, we can use `typedef` and `const` respectively.

4. Use `vector<bool>` instead of a raw array for `isPrime`: The current implementation uses a raw array for `isPrime`, which consumes unnecessary memory. We can use `vector<bool>` instead, which uses a more efficient representation for boolean values.

5. Use `int` instead of `ll` for loop variables: The loop variables `i` and `j` can be of type `int` instead of `ll` since they are used as indices.

6. Avoid unnecessary calculations in the power function: The power function can be optimized by avoiding unnecessary calculations. Instead of multiplying `a_power` with itself in each iteration, we can multiply it with itself only once and update `a_power` accordingly. This reduces the number of multiplications and improves performance.

7. Avoid unnecessary calculations in the sieve function: The sieve function can be optimized by avoiding unnecessary calculations. The outer loop can start from `i = 2` instead of `i = 0` since `isPrime[0]` and `isPrime[1]` are already set to `false`. The inner loop can start from `j = i * i` instead of `j = i` since all numbers less than `i * i` would have been covered in previous iterations. This reduces the number of iterations and improves performance.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <cmath>
using namespace std;

typedef long long ll;

const int MOD = 1000000007;

ll power(ll a_power, ll b_power) {
    ll result_power = 1;
    while (b_power > 0) {
        if (b_power & 1) {
            result_power *= a_power;
        }
        a_power *= a_power;
        b_power /= 2;
    }
    return result_power;
}

void sieve(int maxPrime) {
    vector<bool> isPrime(maxPrime + 1, true);
    isPrime[0] = isPrime[1] = false;
    for (int i = 2; i * i <= maxPrime; i++) {
        if (isPrime[i]) {
            for (int j = i * i; j <= maxPrime; j += i) {
                isPrime[j] = false;
            }
        }
    }
}

int main() {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(NULL);
    cout.tie(0);
  
    int n;
    cin >> n;
  
    sieve(1000000);
  
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        ll a;
        cin >> a;
        ll trex = sqrt(a);
        ll crex = trex * trex;
        if (a == crex) {
            if (isPrime[trex]) {
                cout << "YES" << endl;
            } else {
                cout << "NO" << endl;
            }
        } else {
            cout << "NO" << endl;
        }
    }
  
    return 0;
}
```

These optimizations should improve the running time and memory usage of the program.
