The given program checks whether each number in the input array is a perfect square and if its square root is a prime number. If it is, it sets the corresponding element in the `ans` array to 1, otherwise it sets it to 0. Finally, it prints "YES" or "NO" based on the values in the `ans` array.

To optimize the program, we can make the following improvements:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The program includes the entire `<bits/stdc++.h>` library, which is not recommended. We can remove it and only include the necessary headers, such as `<iostream>` and `<cmath>`.

2. Remove unused variables: The variable `cnt` is declared but not used. We can remove it to improve clarity.

3. Avoid unnecessary checks: The condition `a != 1` is checked for each number in the array, even though it is not necessary. We can remove this check to optimize the program.

4. Use a more efficient algorithm: The current algorithm checks whether each number in the array is a perfect square by calculating its square root using the `sqrt` function. This is not efficient as it involves floating-point calculations. Instead, we can check if a number is a perfect square by using integer arithmetic. We can simply check if the square of the integer square root of the number is equal to the number.

5. Optimize the loop: The loop that checks if a number is a perfect square and sets the corresponding element in the `ans` array can be optimized. We can avoid unnecessary calculations by checking if the number itself is a perfect square and if its square root is a prime number.

6. Print "YES" or "NO" directly: Instead of storing the values in the `ans` array and printing them later, we can directly print "YES" or "NO" based on the condition in the loop.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>

#define ll long long
#define mod 1000000007
#define endl "\n"

int spf[1000001];

void SPF() {
  spf[0] = spf[1] = -1;
  for (int i = 2; i < 1000001; ++i)
    spf[i] = i;
  for (int i = 2; i * i < 1000001; ++i) {
    if (spf[i] == i) {
      for (int j = i; j * i < 1000001; ++j)
        spf[i * j] = i;
    }
  }
}

int main() {
  SPF();
  int n;
  std::cin >> n;

  for (int t = 0; t < n; ++t) {
    ll int a;
    std::cin >> a;
    ll int root = (ll int) sqrt(a);
    if (root * root == a && spf[root] == root)
      std::cout << "YES" << endl;
    else
      std::cout << "NO" << endl;
  }

  return 0;
}
```
