To optimize the given program, we can make the following improvements:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The program includes `<bits/stdc++.h>` which includes a lot of unnecessary headers. We can remove this line and include only the necessary headers, such as `<iostream>` for input/output and `<cmath>` for the `sqrt` function.

2. Remove unnecessary macros: The program defines macros for `ll` and `mod` which are not used. We can remove these macros.

3. Use a more efficient data structure: The program uses an array `ans` to store the results, where each element is either 0 or 1. We can optimize this by using a `vector<bool>` instead, which is more memory-efficient.

4. Use prefix increment operator: The program uses the postfix increment operator `++` in the for loops. We can optimize this by using the prefix increment operator `++` instead.

5. Remove unnecessary variable `minm`: The variable `minm` is defined but not used. We can remove this variable.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

void SPF(vector<int>& spf) {
  spf[0] = spf[1] = -1;
  for (int i = 2; i < spf.size(); ++i)
    spf[i] = i;
  for (int i = 2; i * i < spf.size(); ++i) {
    if (spf[i] == i) {
      for (int j = i; j * i < spf.size(); ++j)
        spf[i * j] = i;
    }
  }
}

int main() {
  int n;
  cin >> n;

  vector<int> spf(1000001);
  SPF(spf);

  vector<bool> ans(n, false);
  for (int t = 0; t < n; ++t) {
    int a;
    cin >> a;
    int root = sqrt(a);
    if (a != 1 && root * root == a && spf[root] == root)
      ans[t] = true;
  }

  for (int t = 0; t < n; ++t) {
    if (ans[t])
      cout << "YES" << endl;
    else
      cout << "NO" << endl;
  }

  return 0;
}
```

Explanation:

1. We remove the unnecessary includes `<bits/stdc++.h>` and `<cmath>` for the `sqrt` function.

2. We remove the unnecessary macros `ll` and `mod`.

3. We modify the `SPF` function to accept a reference to a vector `spf` instead of using a global array. This allows us to pass the vector by reference and avoid creating unnecessary copies.

4. We replace the array `ans` with a `vector<bool>` to save memory. The `vector<bool>` uses a special implementation that stores each boolean value as a single bit, resulting in more memory-efficient storage.

5. We replace the postfix increment operator `++` with the prefix increment operator `++` in the for loops to optimize the loop execution.

6. We remove the unnecessary variable `minm`.

Overall, these optimizations improve the program's running time and memory usage.
