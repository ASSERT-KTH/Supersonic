The given program is checking whether each input number is a perfect square and also a prime number. It uses the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to precompute the smallest prime factor for each number up to 1000000.

To optimize the program, we can make the following changes:

1. Remove unnecessary headers: The program includes the entire "bits/stdc++.h" which is not necessary. We can include only the required headers.

2. Avoid using global variables: The array "spf" is declared as a global variable. It is better to declare it inside the SPF() function to avoid global variables.

3. Use a more efficient method to check for perfect square: Instead of calculating the square root of each number, we can check if the integer square root multiplied by itself is equal to the number.

4. Use a more efficient method to check for prime number: Instead of checking if the smallest prime factor of the square root is equal to the square root itself, we can directly check if the number is equal to its smallest prime factor.

5. Avoid unnecessary memory allocation: The array "ans" is allocated with size "n" but only some elements are set to 1. We can avoid this memory allocation by using a boolean array instead.

6. Avoid unnecessary output: Instead of printing "YES" or "NO" for each number separately, we can accumulate the results and print them at the end.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

vector<int> SPF() {
  int n = 1000001;
  vector<int> spf(n, 0);
  spf[0] = spf[1] = -1;
  for (int i = 2; i < n; ++i)
    spf[i] = i;
  for (int i = 2; i * i < n; ++i) {
    if (spf[i] == i) {
      for (int j = i; j * i < n; ++j)
        spf[i * j] = i;
    }
  }
  return spf;
}

int main() {
  vector<int> spf = SPF();
  
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  vector<bool> ans(n, false);
  for (int t = 0; t < n; ++t) {
    int a;
    cin >> a;
    int root = sqrt(a);
    if (root * root == a && spf[a] == a)
      ans[t] = true;
  }
  
  for (int t = 0; t < n; ++t) {
    if (ans[t])
      cout << "YES" << endl;
    else
      cout << "NO" << endl;
  }
  
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized program reduces unnecessary memory allocation, avoids unnecessary calculations, and improves readability.
