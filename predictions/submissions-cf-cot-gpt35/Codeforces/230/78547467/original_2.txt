The given program is checking if a given number is a perfect square and its square root is a prime number. The program uses the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to generate a list of smallest prime factors for all numbers up to 1000000. Then, it checks each number in the input and determines if it satisfies the given condition.

To optimize the program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The program includes the entire `<bits/stdc++.h>` header, which is not required. We can remove this line.

2. Use a more efficient data type for the `spf` array: The array `spf` is used to store the smallest prime factor for each number. Since the maximum number is 1000000, we can use a smaller data type such as `int8_t` or `int16_t` instead of `int`.

3. Use a more efficient loop condition: In the second loop, the condition `i * i < 1000001` can be replaced with `i < sqrt(1000001)` to avoid the unnecessary multiplication.

4. Use a more efficient data type for `root`: The variable `root` is used to store the square root of the input number. We can use the data type `int` instead of `ll int` since the maximum input number is 1000000.

5. Use a more efficient loop condition: In the second loop, the condition `j * i < 1000001` can be replaced with `j < 1000001 / i` to avoid the unnecessary multiplication.

6. Remove unnecessary variable `minm`: The variable `minm` is declared but not used. We can remove this variable.

7. Use a more efficient loop condition: In the final loop, the condition `t < n` can be replaced with `t != n` to avoid the unnecessary comparison.

8. Use a more efficient output method: Instead of printing "YES" or "NO" for each number, we can store the result in an array and print the entire array at once after the loop.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>
using namespace std;

#define ll long long
#define mod 1000000007

int8_t spf[1000001];

void SPF() {
  spf[0] = spf[1] = -1;

  for (int i = 2; i < 1000001; ++i)
    spf[i] = i;

  for (int i = 2; i <= sqrt(1000001); ++i) {
    if (spf[i] == i) {
      for (int j = i; j <= 1000000 / i; ++j)
        spf[i * j] = i;
    }
  }
}

int main() {
  SPF();
  int n;
  cin >> n;

  ll int a;
  bool ans[n] = {false};

  for (int t = 0; t < n; ++t) {
    cin >> a;
    int root = sqrt(a);
    if (a != 1 && root * root == a && spf[root] == root)
      ans[t] = true;
  }

  for (int t = 0; t != n; ++t) {
    if (ans[t])
      cout << "YES" << endl;
    else
      cout << "NO" << endl;
  }

  return 0;
}
```

The optimized program reduces unnecessary operations and uses more efficient data types, resulting in improved performance in terms of both running time and memory usage.
