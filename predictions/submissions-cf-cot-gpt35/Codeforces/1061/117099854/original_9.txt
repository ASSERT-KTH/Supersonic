The given program is calculating the sum of the divisors of the given numbers. 

To optimize the program, I would make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary header files: The program includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header file, which includes a lot of unnecessary header files. We can remove it and include only the necessary header files.

2. Remove unnecessary macros: The program defines some unnecessary macros, such as `pb`, `pob`, `S`, `F`, `FAST`, `vll`, `pll`, `mod`, `mod2`, `ll`, `ld`, `pi`, `Endl`, and `endl`. We can remove these macros as they are not used in the program.

3. Remove unused variables: The program defines the variable `tt` in the `debug` function, but it is not used anywhere. We can remove this variable.

4. Use a more efficient data structure: The program uses a `vector` to store the divisors of each number. However, we can use a `set` instead, which will automatically sort the divisors in descending order. This will eliminate the need for sorting the divisors manually.

5. Remove unnecessary modulo operations: The program performs modulo operations with `mod` after updating `dp[x]`. However, since `dp[x]` is already initialized with 1, we can remove the modulo operation for `dp[x] += dp[x - 1]` as it will not affect the final result.

6. Simplify the sum calculation: The program calculates the sum of `dp[i]` for `1 <= i <= n` using a loop. However, we can simplify this calculation by using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series. The sum of `dp[i]` for `1 <= i <= n` is equal to `dp[n] * (n + 1) - n`, so we can directly calculate the sum using this formula.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <set>
using namespace std;

const int N = 1e6 + 15;
const int mod = 1000000007;

void solve() {
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  vector<int> dp(N);
  dp[0] = 1;
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    int x;
    cin >> x;
    set<int> divs;
    for (int j = 1; j * j <= x; j++) {
      if (x % j == 0) {
        divs.insert(j);
        if (j * j != x)
          divs.insert(x / j);
      }
    }
    for (auto x : divs) {
      dp[x] += dp[x - 1];
    }
  }
  int ans = (dp[n] * (n + 1) - n) % mod;
  cout << ans;
}

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  cout.tie(NULL);

  solve();

  return 0;
}
```

This optimized program removes unnecessary code, uses a more efficient data structure, and simplifies the sum calculation to improve the running time and memory usage.
