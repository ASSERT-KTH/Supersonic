The main bottleneck in the given program is the use of the `vector` data structure. In each recursive call, the program creates two new vectors `B` and `C` to store the elements based on a condition. This creates unnecessary overhead in terms of time and memory.

To optimize the program, we can modify the `rec` function to use indices instead of vectors. By passing the starting and ending indices of the array `A` instead of the whole vector, we can avoid creating new vectors in each recursive call.

Additionally, we can use bit manipulation operations to eliminate the need for creating `B` and `C` vectors. We can keep track of the count of elements that have the `p`th bit set and the count of elements that do not have the `p`th bit set. This will allow us to calculate the number of elements to the left and right based on the values of these counts.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int rec(vector<int>& A, int start, int end, int p, int numSet, int numUnset) {
  if (p == -1)
    return 0;

  int numSetLeft = 0;
  int numUnsetLeft = 0;
  for (int i = start; i <= end; i++) {
    if (A[i] & (1 << p))
      numSetLeft++;
    else
      numUnsetLeft++;
  }

  int numSetRight = numSet - numSetLeft;
  int numUnsetRight = numUnset - numUnsetLeft;

  if (numSetLeft == 0 || numUnsetLeft == 0) {
    return rec(A, start, end, p - 1, numSetRight, numUnsetRight);
  } else if (numSetRight == 0 || numUnsetRight == 0) {
    return rec(A, start, end, p - 1, numSetLeft, numUnsetLeft);
  } else {
    return (1 << p) + min(rec(A, start, start + numSetLeft - 1, p - 1, numSetLeft, numUnsetLeft),
                          rec(A, start + numSetLeft, end, p - 1, numSetRight, numUnsetRight));
  }
}

int main() {
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  vector<int> A(n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> A[i];
  }

  int numSet = 0;
  int numUnset = n;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    if (A[i] != 0)
      numSet++;
  }

  cout << rec(A, 0, n - 1, 30, numSet, numUnset) << endl;

  return 0;
}
```

Explanation of the optimization steps:

1. Instead of passing the whole vector `A` to the `rec` function, we pass the start and end indices of the current subarray. This avoids unnecessary memory allocation and copying of vectors in each recursive call.

2. We calculate the count of elements that have the `p`th bit set and the count of elements that do not have the `p`th bit set. This is done in a single pass over the subarray, eliminating the need for creating separate vectors `B` and `C`.

3. We calculate the counts of elements to the left and right based on the values of the counts calculated in the previous step.

4. We modify the recursive calls to use the updated parameters. If either the count of elements with the `p`th bit set or the count of elements without the `p`th bit set is zero, we only need to consider the other side.

5. We update the recursive calls to use the appropriate subarray range based on the counts of elements to the left and right.

6. Finally, we calculate the result by adding `(1 << p)` to the minimum of the two recursive calls.

By making these modifications, we can optimize the running time and memory usage of the given program.
