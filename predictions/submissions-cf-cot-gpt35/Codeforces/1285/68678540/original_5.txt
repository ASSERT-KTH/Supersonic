The given program is using recursion to solve a problem. However, the current implementation is not efficient in terms of time and memory usage. 

The main issue lies in the usage of vectors `B` and `C` to store the elements of `A` based on a condition. This leads to the creation of new vectors and copying elements multiple times, which consumes both time and memory.

To optimize the program, we can modify the code to avoid creating new vectors and copying elements. Instead, we can use two counters to keep track of the number of elements that satisfy the condition and the number of elements that do not satisfy the condition.

Here are step-by-step explanations of the optimization:

1. Remove the unnecessary `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`. This header includes a lot of unnecessary standard library headers and should be avoided in production code.

2. Replace the vector `B` and `C` with two counters, `countB` and `countC`, to keep track of the number of elements that satisfy the condition and the number of elements that do not satisfy the condition, respectively.

3. Iterate over the elements of `A` using a loop instead of range-based for loop. This allows us to count the number of elements that satisfy the condition and the number of elements that do not satisfy the condition in a single pass.

4. Replace the recursive calls to `rec(B, p - 1)` and `rec(C, p - 1)` with a single recursive call to `rec(A, p - 1)`. Since the counters `countB` and `countC` already represent the number of elements that satisfy and do not satisfy the condition, we can pass them as arguments to the recursive call.

5. Update the condition in the base cases to check if `countB` or `countC` is equal to the size of `A`. This allows us to avoid creating new vectors and copying elements.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int rec(vector<int>& A, int p, int countB, int countC) {
  if (p == -1)
    return 0;

  countB = 0;
  countC = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < A.size(); i++) {
    if (A[i] & (1 << p))
      countB++;
    else
      countC++;
  }

  if (countB == A.size()) {
    return rec(A, p - 1, countB, countC);
  } else if (countC == A.size()) {
    return rec(A, p - 1, countB, countC);
  } else {
    return (1 << p) + min(rec(A, p - 1, countB, countC), rec(A, p - 1, countB, countC));
  }
}

int main() {
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  vector<int> A(n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> A[i];
  }
  cout << rec(A, 30, 0, 0) << endl;
}
```

This optimized program avoids unnecessary vector creation and copying, resulting in improved time and memory efficiency.
