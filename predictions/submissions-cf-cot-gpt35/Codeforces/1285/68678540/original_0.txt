This program calculates the minimum bitwise OR of all the integers in an array. It does this by recursively dividing the array into two subarrays based on the most significant bit at each position. The program continues this process until it reaches the least significant bit.

To optimize this program, we can make the following changes:

1. Pass the vector `A` by reference instead of by value in the `rec` function. This will avoid unnecessary copying of the vector in each recursive call.

2. Use a single vector for both `B` and `C` instead of creating separate vectors for each. We can use two indices (`b` and `c`) to keep track of the current positions in the vector for `B` and `C` respectively. This will avoid creating and copying vectors in each recursive call.

3. Instead of checking the size of `B` and `C` vectors to determine the next recursion step, we can keep track of the counts of `1` bits at each position (`countB` and `countC`). If `countB` is equal to the size of the input vector, we can recursively call `rec` with `B` and decrement `p`. Similarly, if `countC` is equal to the size of the input vector, we can recursively call `rec` with `C` and decrement `p`. This will avoid calculating the sizes of `B` and `C` vectors in each recursion step.

4. Instead of using the bitwise OR operator (`|`) to calculate the minimum, we can use the bitwise AND operator (`&`) to calculate the maximum. This will avoid calculating the bitwise NOT (`~`) in each recursion step.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int rec(vector<int>& A, int p, int b, int c) {
  if (p == -1)
    return 0;

  int countB = 0, countC = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < A.size(); i++) {
    if (A[i] & (1 << p)) {
      A[b++] = A[i] & ~((1 << p));
      countB++;
    } else {
      A[c++] = A[i] & ~((1 << p));
      countC++;
    }
  }

  if (countB == A.size()) {
    return rec(A, p - 1, b, c);
  } else if (countC == A.size()) {
    return rec(A, p - 1, b, c);
  } else {
    return (1 << p) + min(rec(A, p - 1, b, c), rec(A, p - 1, b + countB, c + countC));
  }
}

int main() {
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  vector<int> A(n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> A[i];
  }
  cout << rec(A, 30, 0, 0) << endl;
}
```

These optimizations should improve the running time and memory usage of the program.
