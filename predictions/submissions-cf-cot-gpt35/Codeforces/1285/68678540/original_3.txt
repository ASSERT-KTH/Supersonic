Step 1: Avoid unnecessary memory allocations in each recursive call

In the original program, the vector `B` and `C` are created in each recursive call of the `rec` function. This can be optimized by passing these vectors as references to the recursive calls, instead of creating new vectors each time.

Step 2: Avoid unnecessary vector copies

In the original program, the vectors `B` and `C` are created by copying elements from the original vector `A`. This can be optimized by using indices to iterate over the elements of `A` and directly modify the original vector.

Step 3: Avoid unnecessary bitwise operations

In the original program, the bitwise operations `x & (1 << p)` and `x & ~((1 << p))` are performed in each iteration of the loop. These operations can be optimized by precomputing the value `1 << p` outside the loop and reusing it.

Step 4: Avoid unnecessary size checks

In the original program, the size of vectors `B` and `C` is checked in each recursive call. This can be optimized by keeping track of the sizes of `B` and `C` as variables and updating them in each iteration of the loop.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int rec(vector<int>& A, int p, int sizeB, int sizeC) {
  if (p == -1)
    return 0;

  int mask = 1 << p;
  int newBSize = 0;
  int newCSize = 0;

  for (int i = 0; i < A.size(); i++) {
    int x = A[i];
    if (x & mask) {
      A[newBSize++] = x & ~mask;
    } else {
      A[newCSize++] = x & ~mask;
    }
  }

  if (A.size() == newBSize) {
    return rec(A, p - 1, newBSize, sizeC);
  } else if (A.size() == newCSize) {
    return rec(A, p - 1, sizeB, newCSize);
  } else {
    return mask + min(rec(A, p - 1, newBSize, sizeC), rec(A, p - 1, sizeB, newCSize));
  }
}

int main() {
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  vector<int> A(n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> A[i];
  }
  cout << rec(A, 30, 0, 0) << endl;
}
```
