The given program is using a recursive approach to solve a binary XOR problem. It takes an integer input `n`, followed by `n` integers, and calculates the minimum XOR value that can be obtained by removing exactly one bit from each input number.

To optimize this program, we can eliminate unnecessary memory usage and improve the running time by making the following changes:

1. Pass the vector `A` by reference instead of by value to avoid unnecessary copying of the vector in each recursive call.
2. Instead of creating separate vectors `B` and `C` in each recursive call, we can use two pointers to divide the input vector `A` into two halves based on the bit at position `p`.
3. Instead of recalculating the size of vectors `B` and `C` in each recursive call, we can keep track of their sizes as variables.
4. Remove the unnecessary return statement at the end of the `rec` function.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int rec(vector<int>& A, int p, int size) {
  if (p == -1)
    return 0;

  int sizeB = 0, sizeC = 0;

  for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
    if (A[i] & (1 << p))
      A[sizeB++] = A[i] & ~((1 << p));
    else
      A[sizeB + sizeC++] = A[i] & ~((1 << p));
  }

  if (sizeB == size) {
    return rec(A, p - 1, sizeB);
  } else if (sizeC == size) {
    return rec(A, p - 1, sizeC);
  } else {
    return (1 << p) + min(rec(A, p - 1, sizeB), rec(A, p - 1, sizeC));
  }
}

int main() {
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  vector<int> A(n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> A[i];
  }
  cout << rec(A, 30, n) << endl;
}
```

These optimizations reduce the memory usage by eliminating unnecessary vector creations and copying, and improve the running time by avoiding redundant calculations.
