The given program calculates the sum of a modified array using a function `getN()` which calculates the number of times the number `x` divides each element of the array `a`. The modified array `b` is then used to calculate the sum.

To optimize the program, we can make the following changes:

1. Remove unnecessary header files: The program includes the unnecessary header file `<bits/stdc++.h>`. We can remove it.

2. Remove unnecessary macros: The macro definitions `int long long` and `mod 1000000007` are not used in the program. We can remove them.

3. Avoid unnecessary input-output operations: The program reads the value of `n` and `x` for each test case. Instead, we can read these values once before the test cases loop.

4. Avoid unnecessary vector initialization: The program initializes vectors `a` and `b` with size `n` but doesn't use the default values. We can remove the initialization and resize the vectors when needed.

5. Avoid unnecessary function call: The function `getN()` is called for each element of `a` to calculate `b[i]`. However, we can calculate `b[i]` directly in the loop without the need for a separate function.

6. Optimize the sum calculation: The sum calculation can be optimized by calculating the sum directly in the second loop instead of updating `b[i]` and then calculating the sum separately in the third loop.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  
  int t;
  cin >> t;
  
  while (t--) {
    int n, x;
    cin >> n >> x;
    
    vector<int> a(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
      cin >> a[i];
    }
    
    int sum = 0;
    int minVal = INT_MAX;
    
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
      int cnt = 0;
      int num = a[i];
      
      while (num > 0 && num % x == 0) {
        ++cnt;
        num /= x;
      }
      
      minVal = min(minVal, cnt);
      sum += minVal * a[i] + a[i];
    }
    
    cout << sum << "\n";
  }
  
  return 0;
}
```

In the optimized program, we calculate `b[i]` directly in the loop using a variable `cnt`. We also calculate the minimum value `minVal` in the same loop and update the sum calculation accordingly. This avoids the need for the second loop to update `b[i]` and the third loop to calculate the sum separately.
