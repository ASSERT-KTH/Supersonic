The given program calculates the sum of products of elements of an array `a` with their corresponding powers of a number `x`. The powers of `x` are calculated using the `getN` function.

To optimize the program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove the unnecessary `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`, as it includes a large number of header files and can increase the compilation time and memory usage.

2. Remove the `#define int long long` and use `int64_t` instead of `long long` to ensure consistent and portable code.

3. Remove the `#define mod 1000000007` as it is not used in the program.

4. Remove the `#define endl "\n"` as it is not used in the program.

5. Remove the `fast` function and its usage, as it is not used in the program.

6. Modify the `getN` function to use pass-by-reference for the `n` parameter instead of pass-by-value, as we don't need to modify the original value of `n` inside the function.

7. Use a single loop instead of two separate loops to calculate the minimum values in the `b` vector.

8. Remove the unnecessary `sum += a[i]` calculation in the second loop, as it is already covered by `sum += b[i] * a[i]`.

9. Remove the unnecessary newline character `"\n"` after each test case, as it is not required.

10. Replace the `signed main` with `int main`, as it is the standard form of the main function in C/C++.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

int64_t getN(int64_t& n, int64_t x) {
  int64_t cnt = 0;
  while (n > 0 && n % x == 0) {
    ++cnt;
    n /= x;
  }
  return cnt;
}

int main() {
  int64_t t;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    int64_t n, x;
    cin >> n >> x;
    vector<int64_t> a(n), b(n);
    for (auto& c : a)
      cin >> c;
    int64_t tok = getN(a[0], x);
    for (int64_t i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
      b[i] = getN(a[i], x);
      if (i != 0)
        b[i] = min(b[i], tok);
      tok = min(tok, b[i]);
    }
    tok = b[n - 1];
    int64_t sum = 0;
    for (int64_t i = n - 1; i >= 0; --i) {
      if (i != n - 1)
        b[i] = min(b[i], 1 + tok);
      tok = min(tok, b[i]);
      sum += b[i] * a[i];
    }
    cout << sum << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```
