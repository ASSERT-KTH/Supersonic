Step 1: Remove unnecessary includes
- The program includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header which is not necessary and can be replaced with the necessary standard headers.
- The `using namespace std;` statement can also be removed to avoid polluting the global namespace.

Step 2: Remove unnecessary macros
- The program defines two macros `int` and `mod` which are not used. These can be removed.

Step 3: Optimize the `getN` function
- The `getN` function calculates the number of times `x` divides `n`.
- Instead of repeatedly dividing `n` by `x`, we can directly calculate the count by using logarithms.
- We can use the `log` function to calculate the logarithm of `n` with base `x`.
- Since the result may not be an integer, we can round it to the nearest integer using the `round` function.
- Finally, we can convert the rounded result to an integer using the `static_cast<int>` conversion.
- This optimization will reduce the number of iterations in the while loop.

Step 4: Optimize the main loop
- The main loop calculates the values of the `b` vector and then calculates the final sum.
- Instead of calculating the values of `b` separately, we can calculate the sum directly.
- We can calculate the sum by multiplying each element of `a` by the minimum value of `b` and adding `a[i]`.
- We can keep track of the minimum value of `b` while calculating the sum.
- This optimization will reduce the number of iterations in the main loop.

Step 5: Optimize the input/output operations
- The program uses `cin` and `cout` for input/output operations.
- These operations can be slow when used repeatedly.
- We can use `scanf` and `printf` instead, which are faster for input/output operations.
- This optimization will improve the overall running time of the program.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <cmath>

int getN(int n, int x) {
  int cnt = static_cast<int>(round(log(n) / log(x)));
  return cnt;
}

void solve() {
  int n, x;
  scanf("%d %d", &n, &x);
  std::vector<int> a(n), b(n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    scanf("%d", &a[i]);
  }
  int sum = 0;
  int minB = getN(a[0], x);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    minB = std::min(minB, getN(a[i], x));
    sum += minB * a[i] + a[i];
  }
  printf("%d\n", sum);
}

int main(void) {
  int t;
  scanf("%d", &t);
  while (t--) {
    solve();
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Note: I removed the file input/output operations (`freopen`) from the `fast` function since they were not used in the program.
