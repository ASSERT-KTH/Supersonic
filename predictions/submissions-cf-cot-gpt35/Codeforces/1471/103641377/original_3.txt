The given program is a C++ program that calculates some values based on an input array `a`. The program uses an unordered map `mp` to store the frequency of certain values. It also uses a vector `dp` for pre-processing.

To optimize the program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary header files: The program includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header file, which includes a lot of unnecessary header files. We can remove this line and include only the necessary header files.

2. Remove unnecessary macros: The program defines several macros that are not used. We can remove these macros to simplify the code.

3. Remove unnecessary functions: The program defines several functions that are not used. We can remove these functions to simplify the code.

4. Avoid using `namespace std`: The program uses the `using namespace std;` statement, which brings all the identifiers from the `std` namespace into the global namespace. This can cause naming conflicts. We can avoid using this statement and use the `std::` prefix when necessary.

5. Avoid using unnecessary data types: The program uses data types like `long long` and `unsigned long long` unnecessarily. We can use simpler data types like `int` instead.

6. Remove unnecessary debug statements: The program defines several debug statements that are not used. We can remove these statements to simplify the code.

7. Avoid unnecessary calculations: The program calculates the square root of `num` multiple times in the inner loop of the `preprocess` function. We can calculate it once and store it in a variable to avoid unnecessary calculations.

8. Optimize the loop conditions: The program uses the `fr` macro to define loops. The loop conditions can be optimized by using a pre-calculated value instead of calculating it in every iteration.

9. Optimize the use of the unordered map: The program uses an unordered map `mp` to store the frequency of certain values. We can use a simple array instead of an unordered map to improve the memory usage and reduce the time complexity.

10. Avoid unnecessary calculations in the loop: The program calculates `ans1` in every iteration of the loop. We can calculate it once and update it only when necessary.

11. Optimize the calculation of `ans2`: The program calculates `ans2` by iterating over the unordered map `mp` and checking the frequency of each value. We can optimize this calculation by keeping track of the total sum of even frequencies and the maximum frequency of any value.

12. Avoid unnecessary input/output operations: The program performs input/output operations in each iteration of the loop. We can avoid these operations by storing the results in a vector and printing them at the end.

After applying these optimizations, the optimized program is as follows:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <cmath>

void preprocess(std::vector<int>& dp) {
  const int N = dp.size();
  dp[1] = 1;
  for (int num = 2; num < N; ++num) {
    int sqrtNum = std::sqrt(num);
    for (int i = 2; i <= sqrtNum; ++i) {
      if (num % i == 0) {
        if (dp[num / i] % i)
          dp[num] = dp[num / i] * i;
        else
          dp[num] = dp[num / i] / i;
        break;
      }
    }
    if (dp[num] == 0)
      dp[num] = num;
  }
}

void solve() {
  int n;
  std::cin >> n;
  
  std::vector<int> a(n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
    std::cin >> a[i];

  std::vector<int> dp(1e6 + 5);
  preprocess(dp);

  std::vector<int> freq(1e6 + 5);
  int maxFreq = 0;
  int sumEvenFreq = 0;

  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    int val = dp[a[i]];
    ++freq[val];
    maxFreq = std::max(maxFreq, freq[val]);
    if (freq[val] % 2 == 0 || val == 1)
      sumEvenFreq += freq[val];
  }

  int q;
  std::cin >> q;
  std::vector<int> results(q);

  for (int i = 0; i < q; ++i) {
    int w;
    std::cin >> w;
    if (w == 0)
      results[i] = maxFreq;
    else
      results[i] = std::max(maxFreq, sumEvenFreq);
  }

  for (int i = 0; i < q; ++i)
    std::cout << results[i] << '\n';
}

int main() {
  std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  std::cin.tie(NULL);
  std::cout.tie(NULL);

  int t;
  std::cin >> t;
  while (t--)
    solve();

  return 0;
}
```

This optimized program reduces unnecessary code, optimizes loop conditions, avoids unnecessary calculations, and optimizes the use of data structures to improve running time and memory usage.
