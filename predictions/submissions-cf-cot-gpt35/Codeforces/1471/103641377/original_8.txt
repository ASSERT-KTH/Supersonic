To optimize the given program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary header files: The `bits/stdc++.h` header file includes a lot of standard C++ library header files. However, it is not recommended to include this header file in production code as it increases compilation time. Instead, we can include only the necessary standard library header files.

2. Remove unnecessary macros: There are several macros defined in the program that are not used. We can remove these macros to simplify the code.

3. Remove unnecessary functions: There are several functions defined in the program that are not used. We can remove these functions to reduce memory usage.

4. Remove unnecessary debug printing: The program includes a lot of debug printing statements that are not necessary for the final optimized program. We can remove these debug printing statements to improve the running time.

5. Use `vector` instead of `unordered_map` for counting: The program uses an `unordered_map` to count the occurrences of each element in the array. However, since the elements are integers, we can use a `vector` to count the occurrences. This will reduce the memory usage and improve the running time.

6. Remove unnecessary calculations in the main loop: The main loop of the program calculates `ans1` and `ans2` for each query, even though these values do not change for each query. We can move these calculations outside the loop to improve the running time.

7. Remove unnecessary preprocessing: The program includes a preprocessing step to calculate the prime factors of each number. However, this step is not necessary for the given problem. We can remove this preprocessing step to simplify the code and improve the running time.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <cmath>
#include <unordered_map>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(NULL);
    cout.tie(NULL);

    int t;
    cin >> t;

    while (t--) {
        int n;
        cin >> n;

        vector<int> a(n);
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            cin >> a[i];
        }

        vector<int> count(1000006, 0);
        int ans1 = 1;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            count[a[i]]++;
            ans1 = max(ans1, count[a[i]]);
        }

        int ans2 = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i <= 1000000; ++i) {
            if (count[i] % 2 == 0 || i == 1) {
                ans2 += count[i];
            }
        }

        int q;
        cin >> q;

        while (q--) {
            int w;
            cin >> w;

            if (w == 0) {
                cout << ans1 << endl;
            } else {
                cout << max(ans1, ans2) << endl;
            }
        }
    }

    return 0;
}
```
