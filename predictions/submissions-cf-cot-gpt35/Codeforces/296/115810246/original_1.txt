Step 1: Remove unnecessary headers
- The program includes `<bits/stdc++.h>`, which includes all standard libraries. This is not necessary and can be replaced with the specific headers that are actually needed.

Step 2: Remove unused typedefs and macros
- The program defines `typedef long long ll` and `typedef vector<int> vi`, but these types are not used in the program. They can be removed.
- The program defines macros for `el`, `PI`, `MP`, `pb(v)`, `all(v)`, `sz(v)`, `clr(v, d)`, `EPS`, and `MOD`, but these macros are not used in the program. They can be removed.

Step 3: Use `cin` and `cout` instead of `freopen` and `ios_base`
- The program uses `freopen` to redirect input and output from files. This is not necessary and can be removed.
- The program uses `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false)` and `cin.tie(NULL)` to improve input/output performance. This is not necessary and can be removed.

Step 4: Optimize memory usage
- The program declares arrays `a`, `b`, `c`, `ans`, and `op` with a size of 100005. However, the program only uses `m` elements of these arrays. We can reduce the size of these arrays to `m` to save memory.

Step 5: Optimize the loop for calculating `op`
- The loop for calculating `op` can be optimized by removing the need for an extra array. Instead of storing the increment and decrement separately in `op`, we can directly update `ans` in the same loop.

Step 6: Optimize the loop for calculating `ans`
- The loop for calculating `ans` can be optimized by removing the need for the second loop. Instead of updating `ans` in the second loop, we can calculate the prefix sum of `ans` in the first loop itself.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int n, m, k;
  cin >> n >> m >> k;
  vector<long long> arr(n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> arr[i];
  }
  vector<long long> a(m), b(m), c(m), ans(n), op(m);
  for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
    cin >> a[i] >> b[i] >> c[i];
  }
  for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
    int x, y;
    cin >> x >> y;
    op[x - 1]++;
    op[y]--;
  }
  for (int i = 1; i < m; i++) {
    op[i] += op[i - 1];
  }
  for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
    ans[a[i] - 1] += op[i] * c[i];
    ans[b[i]] -= op[i] * c[i];
  }
  cout << ans[0] + arr[0] << " ";
  for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
    ans[i] += ans[i - 1];
    cout << ans[i] + arr[i] << " ";
  }
  cout << endl;
  return 0;
}
```
