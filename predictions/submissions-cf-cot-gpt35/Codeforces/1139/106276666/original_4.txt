Optimization Step-by-Step:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The program includes `<bits/stdc++.h>` and `<stdio.h>` but does not use any functions or objects from these headers. We can remove these includes.

2. Remove unnecessary typedefs: The program typedefs `long long` as `ll` and `unsigned long long` as `ul`, but these typedefs are not used in the program. We can remove these typedefs.

3. Use const instead of #define: The program uses `#define` to define constants for `len` and `mod`, but it is better to use `const` variables instead of `#define`. We can replace `#define len (int)1e6 + 5` with `const int len = 1e6 + 5` and `#define mod (ll)(1e9 + 7)` with `const ll mod = (ll)(1e9 + 7)`.

4. Remove unnecessary macros: The program defines macros for priority queues and vector operations, but these macros are not used in the program. We can remove these macros.

5. Remove unnecessary functions: The program defines several functions (`modpow`, `mod_`, `make_prm`, `make_factor`, `make_pascalTri`, `gcd`, `give_floor`, `is_perfect`, `dfs`), but only `dfs` is used in the program. We can remove the unused functions.

6. Optimize the `make_prm` function: The `make_prm` function is used to generate a boolean array `prm` to check if a number is prime or not. However, it generates the array for all numbers up to `len`, which is unnecessary. We can optimize this function by generating the array only up to the square root of `len` since any non-prime number can be represented as a product of two numbers, one of which is less than or equal to its square root.

7. Optimize the `make_factor` function: The `make_factor` function is used to generate factors of a given number `n`. However, it generates all factors up to `n`, which is unnecessary. We can optimize this function by generating factors only up to the square root of `n` since any factor of `n` can be represented as a product of two numbers, one of which is less than or equal to its square root.

8. Optimize the `make_pascalTri` function: The `make_pascalTri` function is used to generate Pascal's triangle up to a given row `n`. However, it uses a 2D array `pascal_tri` to store the triangle, which is unnecessary. We can optimize this function by using only two 1D arrays to store the current row and the previous row of the triangle.

9. Optimize the `dfs` function: The `dfs` function is used to perform a depth-first search on a graph. However, it uses a global boolean array `vis` to keep track of visited nodes, which is unnecessary. We can pass a visited array as a parameter to the function instead of using a global array.

10. Optimize the main program: The main program calculates the sum of `modpow(dfs(i, -1), k, mod)` for all unvisited nodes and then subtracts it from `modpow(n, k, mod)`. However, it uses a global variable `sm` to store the sum and updates it inside the loop, which is unnecessary. We can calculate the sum directly inside the loop without using a global variable.

Optimized Program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <cstring>
using namespace std;

typedef long long ll;

const int len = 1e6 + 5;
const ll mod = 1e9 + 7;

vector<int> adj[len];
bool vis[len];

ll modpow(ll x, ll n, ll m) {
  if (n == 0)
    return 1LL % m;
  ll u = modpow(x, n / 2, m);
  u = (u * u) % m;
  if (n % 2 == 1)
    u = (u * x) % m;
  return u;
}

ll dfs(int n, int p, bool vis[]) {
  if (vis[n])
    return 0;
  vis[n] = true;
  ll x = 0;
  for (auto u : adj[n]) {
    if (u != p)
      x += dfs(u, n, vis);
  }
  return x + 1;
}

int main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(0);
  cin.tie(0);
  
  int n, k;
  cin >> n >> k;
  
  for (int i = 1; i <= n - 1; i++) {
    int u, v, x;
    cin >> u >> v >> x;
    if (x == 0)
      adj[u].push_back(v), adj[v].push_back(u);
  }
  
  ll ans = modpow(n, k, mod);
  ll sm = 0;
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    bool vis[len];
    memset(vis, false, sizeof(vis));
    if (!vis[i]) {
      sm += modpow(dfs(i, -1, vis), k, mod);
      sm %= mod;
    }
  }
  
  cout << (ans - sm + mod) % mod << endl;
  
  return 0;
}
```
