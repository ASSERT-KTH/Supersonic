Step 1: Remove unnecessary header files.

The program includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header file, which is not a standard C++ header file. It includes all the standard library header files and some non-standard ones as well. Since the program does not use all the included headers, we can remove `<bits/stdc++.h>` and include only the necessary headers.

Step 2: Remove unnecessary macros.

The program defines several macros that are not used. We can remove these macros to simplify the code.

Step 3: Use `cout` and `cin` instead of `printf` and `scanf`.

The program uses `printf` and `scanf` for input and output. We can replace these with `cout` and `cin` for a more idiomatic and efficient C++ code.

Step 4: Remove unnecessary variable declarations.

The program declares several variables that are not used. We can remove these variable declarations to reduce memory usage.

Step 5: Optimize the `check` function.

The `check` function checks if a number is divisible by all its digits. We can optimize this function by converting the number to a string only once, outside the loop. This way, we avoid the overhead of converting the number to a string in each iteration of the loop.

Step 6: Optimize the `solve` function.

The `solve` function checks if a number satisfies the condition in the `check` function. If not, it increments the number and repeats the check. Instead of incrementing the number one by one, we can increment it in larger steps. For example, we can increment it by 10 if the last digit is less than or equal to 5, and by 1 otherwise. This way, we skip many numbers that are not divisible by all their digits.

Here's the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

bool check(ll n) {
  string s = to_string(n);
  for (char c : s) {
    if (c == '0') continue;
    if (n % (c - '0') != 0) {
      return false;
    }
  }
  return true;
}

void solve() {
  ll n;
  cin >> n;
  while (!check(n)) {
    if (n % 10 <= 5) {
      n += 10;
    } else {
      n++;
    }
  }
  cout << n << endl;
}

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(nullptr);
  int t;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    solve();
  }
  return 0;
}
```
