Step 1: Remove unnecessary includes
The program includes the header file `bits/stdc++.h` which is not a standard C++ header file and is generally not recommended to be used. It includes many standard library headers, which can result in increased compilation time and unnecessary memory usage. We can remove this line and include only the necessary standard library headers.

Step 2: Remove unnecessary macros
The program defines several macros that are not being used. We can remove these macros to simplify the code.

Step 3: Remove unnecessary typedefs
The program defines several typedefs for standard library types that are not being used. We can remove these typedefs to simplify the code.

Step 4: Remove unnecessary header files
The program includes several header files that are not being used. We can remove these header files to simplify the code.

Step 5: Replace `std::endl` with `'\n'`
The program uses `std::endl` to output a new line, which flushes the output stream in addition to inserting a new line. This can result in decreased performance. We can replace `std::endl` with `'\n'` to only insert a new line without flushing the output stream.

Step 6: Optimize the `check` function
The `check` function converts the input number to a string and checks if each digit is a divisor of the number. This can be optimized by using integer division and modulus operations instead of converting the number to a string. We can also optimize the loop condition to terminate early if a digit is not a divisor of the number.

Step 7: Optimize the `solve` function
The `solve` function uses a while loop to increment the input number until it satisfies the condition in the `check` function. This can be optimized by incrementing the input number by the smallest divisor of the number. Since the smallest divisor is always 1, we can increment the input number by 1.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

bool check(int n) {
  std::vector<int> digits;
  int temp = n;
  while (temp > 0) {
    int digit = temp % 10;
    digits.push_back(digit);
    temp /= 10;
  }
  
  for (int digit : digits) {
    if (digit == 0) {
      continue;
    }
    if (n % digit != 0) {
      return false;
    }
  }
  
  return true;
}

void solve() {
  int n;
  std::cin >> n;
  
  while (!check(n)) {
    n++;
  }
  
  std::cout << n << '\n';
}

int main() {
  std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  std::cin.tie(nullptr);
  
  int t;
  std::cin >> t;
  
  while (t--) {
    solve();
  }
  
  return 0;
}
```
