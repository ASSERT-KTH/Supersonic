Step 1: Remove unnecessary header files.

The program includes the `bits/stdc++.h` header file, which includes almost all standard library headers. This can slow down the compilation process and increase memory usage. Since the program does not actually use all the included headers, we can remove this line and include only the necessary header files.

Step 2: Remove unnecessary macros.

The program defines a number of macros that are not used. We can remove these macros to simplify the code.

Step 3: Optimize the check function.

The check function converts the given number to a string and checks if each digit is a factor of the number. This can be optimized by directly iterating over the digits of the number using modulo and division operations.

Step 4: Optimize the solve function.

The solve function can be optimized by using a while loop instead of an if-else statement. This will eliminate the need for the else block and the increment operation on `n`.

Step 5: Optimize the main function.

The main function can be optimized by removing the unnecessary `cin` statement inside the solve function. Instead, we can pass `n` as a parameter to the solve function.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

bool check(ll n) {
    ll temp = n;
    while (temp > 0) {
        int digit = temp % 10;
        if (digit == 0 || n % digit != 0)
            return false;
        temp /= 10;
    }
    return true;
}

void solve(ll n) {
    while (!check(n))
        n++;
    cout << n << endl;
}

int main() {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(NULL);
    
    int t;
    cin >> t;
    while (t--) {
        ll n;
        cin >> n;
        solve(n);
    }
    
    return 0;
}
```

Explanation of the optimizations:

- The unnecessary header file `bits/stdc++.h` is removed.
- The unnecessary macros are removed.
- The check function is optimized to directly iterate over the digits of the number using modulo and division operations.
- The solve function is optimized by using a while loop instead of an if-else statement.
- The main function is optimized by removing the unnecessary `cin` statement inside the solve function and passing `n` as a parameter instead.
