The given program seems to be calculating and printing the value of 'ans' for each test case. The program uses multiple variables and calculations to update the value of 'ans' based on the input values. 

To optimize the program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary header files: The program includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header file which includes a large number of other header files. This can increase the compilation time and memory usage. Since the program does not use any specific functionality from these header files, we can remove this line.

2. Remove unused variables: The program defines variables `a2`, `b2`, and `c2` but does not use them anywhere. We can remove these variables to improve memory usage.

3. Combine variable declarations: The program declares variables `a1`, `b1`, and `c1` on separate lines. We can combine these declarations on a single line to make the code more concise.

4. Simplify variable updates: The program updates the values of variables `c1`, `b2`, and `c2` by subtracting 'temp' from them. We can simplify this by using the compound assignment operator "-=".

5. Remove unnecessary calculations: The program calculates 'temp' as the minimum of `c1` and `b2`, and later calculates 'temp' as the minimum of `c1` and `c2`. Since `c1` is not updated between these calculations, we can remove the second calculation and reuse the value of 'temp' from the first calculation.

6. Simplify 'ans' calculation: The program calculates 'ans' by adding 'temp' multiplied by 2, and later subtracting 'temp' multiplied by 2. We can simplify this by directly multiplying 'temp' by 2 and updating 'ans' in a single step.

7. Remove unnecessary 'using' statement: The program includes a 'using' statement for the `std` namespace, but it is not used anywhere in the program. We can remove this line.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  int t;
  std::cin >> t;
  
  while (t--) {
    int a1, b1, c1;
    std::cin >> a1 >> b1 >> c1;
    
    int ans = 0;
    int temp = std::min(c1, b1);
    ans += temp * 2;
    c1 -= temp;
    b1 -= temp;
    
    temp = std::min(a1, c1);
    c1 -= temp;
    
    temp = std::min(b1, c1);
    ans -= temp * 2;
    
    std::cout << ans << std::endl;
  }
  
  return 0;
}
```
