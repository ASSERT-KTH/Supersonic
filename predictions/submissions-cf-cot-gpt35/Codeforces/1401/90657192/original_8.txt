To optimize the given program, I will make the following changes:

1. Remove the unnecessary inclusion of the `bits/stdc++.h` header file. This header file includes many other header files, which can slow down the compilation process.

2. Remove the `IOS` macro. This macro disables the synchronization between C and C++ standard streams, which is not necessary for this program. It also slows down the input/output operations.

3. Change the data types of `a1`, `b1`, `c1`, `a2`, `b2`, and `c2` to `int` instead of `long long`. The given program uses `long long` data type unnecessarily, which consumes more memory.

4. Modify the logic of the program to avoid repeated calculations. Currently, the program calculates the minimum value multiple times, which can be optimized.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int t;
  cin >> t;
  
  while (t--) {
    int a1, b1, c1, a2, b2, c2;
    cin >> a1 >> b1 >> c1 >> a2 >> b2 >> c2;
    
    int ans = 0;
    int temp;
    
    temp = min(c1, b2);
    ans += temp * 2;
    c1 -= temp;
    b2 -= temp;
    
    temp = min(c1, c2);
    c2 -= temp;
    
    temp = min(a1, c2);
    c2 -= temp;
    
    temp = min(b1, c2);
    ans -= 2 * temp;
    
    cout << ans << endl;
  }
}
```
