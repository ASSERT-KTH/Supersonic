The given program can be optimized by removing unnecessary includes and preprocessor directives. Additionally, we can optimize the calculation of the answer by eliminating some intermediate variables.

Here are the optimization steps:

1. Remove the unnecessary include directive for the `bits/stdc++.h` header. Instead, include the necessary headers individually.

2. Remove the preprocessor directive for defining `ll` as `long long`. We can directly use `long long` wherever needed.

3. Remove the preprocessor directive for defining `IOS`. It is not necessary for this program.

4. Remove the unnecessary `using namespace std;` directive. We can qualify the standard library types and functions with the `std::` prefix.

5. Replace `int32_t` with `int` for the `main` function return type.

6. Remove the intermediate variable `temp` and perform the calculations directly.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>

int main() {
    int t;
    std::cin >> t;
    while (t--) {
        long long a1, b1, c1, a2, b2, c2;
        std::cin >> a1 >> b1 >> c1 >> a2 >> b2 >> c2;
        long long ans = 0;
        ans += std::min(c1, b2) * 2;
        c1 -= std::min(c1, b2);
        b2 -= std::min(c1, b2);
        c2 -= std::min(c1, c2);
        c2 -= std::min(a1, c2);
        ans -= 2 * std::min(b1, c2);
        std::cout << ans << std::endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
```

This optimized program eliminates unnecessary includes and preprocessor directives. It also simplifies the calculation of the answer by removing intermediate variables and performing calculations directly.
