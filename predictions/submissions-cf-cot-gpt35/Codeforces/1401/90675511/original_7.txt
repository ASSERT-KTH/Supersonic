The given program can be optimized in the following steps:

1. Remove unnecessary headers: The `<bits/stdc++.h>` header includes a large number of standard library headers, which can slow down the compilation process. Since the program only requires the `iostream` header, we can remove the unnecessary headers.

2. Remove unnecessary input/output optimizations: The lines `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0); cin.tie(0); cout.tie(0);` are used to disable the synchronization between C and C++ standard streams, but they are not necessary for this program. We can remove these lines to simplify the code.

3. Optimize the sorting algorithm: The program uses the `sort` function to sort the elements of the array `c` in ascending order. However, since the array `c` contains only positive integers, we can use a counting sort algorithm instead of the generic comparison-based sorting algorithm. Counting sort has a linear time complexity, while the `sort` function has a time complexity of O(n log n).

4. Optimize the flag check: The program uses a flag variable to check if the array `a` is sorted in non-decreasing order. However, this check can be done more efficiently by comparing adjacent elements of the array in a single loop. If any adjacent elements are out of order, we can immediately conclude that the array is not sorted.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <climits>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int t;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    int n;
    cin >> n;
    int a[n], b[n], c[n];
    int m = INT_MAX;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      cin >> a[i];
      if (a[i] < m)
        m = a[i];
    }
    int k = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      if (a[i] % m == 0) {
        b[k] = i;
        c[k] = a[i];
        k++;
      }
    }
    // Counting sort
    int count[1001] = {0};
    for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
      count[c[i]]++;
    }
    int idx = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i <= 1000; i++) {
      while (count[i] > 0) {
        c[idx] = i;
        idx++;
        count[i]--;
      }
    }
    for (int i = 0; i < k; i++)
      a[b[i]] = c[i];
    // Check if the array is sorted
    bool flag = false;
    for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
      if (a[i] > a[i + 1]) {
        flag = true;
        break;
      }
    }
    if (flag)
      cout << "NO" << endl;
    else
      cout << "YES" << endl;
  }
}
```
