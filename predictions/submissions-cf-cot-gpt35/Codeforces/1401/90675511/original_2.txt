Optimization Steps:
1. Remove unnecessary include directive: The `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` directive includes a large number of standard library headers, which can slow down the compilation process. Since we are not using any specific headers from this directive, it can be removed.

2. Avoid using variable-length arrays: The original program declares arrays `a`, `b`, and `c` with a variable length `n`. Variable-length arrays are not supported in standard C++, so it is best to avoid them. We can use `vector` instead, which provides a dynamic array-like functionality.

3. Avoid sorting unnecessary elements: The program sorts only the elements in array `c` that are actually used. However, it sorts the entire `c` array, which is unnecessary and can be optimized.

4. Optimize the search for the minimum element: The program iterates over the array `a` twice to find the minimum element `m`. We can optimize this step by finding the minimum element in a single pass.

5. Combine two loops into one: The loops that populate arrays `b` and `c` can be combined into a single loop, eliminating the need for an extra loop.

6. Use a boolean flag instead of an integer flag: The flag variable `flag` is used as an integer to check if the array is sorted. We can use a boolean flag instead, which is more intuitive.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <climits>
#include <algorithm>

int main() {
  std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  std::cin.tie(nullptr);
  std::cout.tie(nullptr);

  int t;
  std::cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    int n;
    std::cin >> n;
    std::vector<int> a(n), b, c;
    int m = INT_MAX;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      std::cin >> a[i];
      if (a[i] < m)
        m = a[i];
    }
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      if (a[i] % m == 0) {
        b.push_back(i);
        c.push_back(a[i]);
      }
    }
    std::sort(c.begin(), c.end());
    for (int i = 0; i < b.size(); i++)
      a[b[i]] = c[i];
    bool flag = false;
    for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++)
      if (a[i] > a[i + 1]) {
        flag = true;
        break;
      }
    if (flag)
      std::cout << "NO\n";
    else
      std::cout << "YES\n";
  }
}
```
