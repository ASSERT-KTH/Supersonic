To optimize the given program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary header file inclusion: The program includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header file, which is not recommended as it includes a large number of other header files, leading to increased compilation time and memory usage. We can remove this line and include only the necessary header files.

2. Replace the `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0)` line: This line is used to disable the synchronization between C and C++ standard streams, but it also has a negative impact on performance. We can remove this line as it is not necessary in this program.

3. Avoid using variable-length arrays: The program uses variable-length arrays (`int a[n], b[n], c[n]`), which are not standard in C++ and can lead to potential issues. We can replace them with dynamic arrays (`vector<int> a(n), b(n), c(n)`).

4. Initialize `m` to `INT_MAX` inside the loop: The variable `m` is initialized to `INT_MAX` inside the loop, which is unnecessary. We can move this initialization outside the loop and directly assign `INT_MAX` to `m` initially.

5. Avoid unnecessary sorting: The program sorts the array `c` using `sort(c, c + k)`, but this is not necessary. Since `c` is initialized with elements in non-decreasing order, we can skip the sorting step.

6. Avoid unnecessary usage of `flag` variable: The program uses a `flag` variable to check if the array `a` is sorted. Instead, we can directly check if `a[i] > a[i + 1]` inside the loop and break if the condition is true.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int t;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    int n;
    cin >> n;
    vector<int> a(n), b(n), c(n);
    int m = INT_MAX;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      cin >> a[i];
      if (a[i] < m)
        m = a[i];
    }
    int k = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      if (a[i] % m == 0) {
        b[k] = i;
        c[k] = a[i];
        k++;
      }
    }
    for (int i = 0; i < k; i++)
      a[b[i]] = c[i];
    bool sorted = true;
    for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
      if (a[i] > a[i + 1]) {
        sorted = false;
        break;
      }
    }
    if (sorted)
      cout << "YES" << endl;
    else
      cout << "NO" << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```

The optimized program removes unnecessary overhead and improves both the running time and memory usage.
