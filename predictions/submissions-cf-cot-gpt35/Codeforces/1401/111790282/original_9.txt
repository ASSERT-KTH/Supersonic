The given program reads in a number `t` and for each test case, it reads in `xa`, `ya`, `za`, `xb`, `yb`, `zb` and performs some calculations to calculate and output the value of `ans` for each test case.

To optimize this program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary header file: The program includes `<bits/stdc++.h>` which includes all the standard library header files. However, this is not necessary for this program as it only uses a few standard library functions. We can remove this line.

2. Avoid repeated calculations: The program calculates `2 * mn` twice. We can avoid this by storing the result of `2 * mn` in a variable and reuse it.

3. Remove unused variables: The variables `mn2` and `ans` are not used outside the loop. We can move their declaration inside the loop to avoid unnecessary memory usage.

Here is the optimized program:

```c++
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int t;
  cin >> t;

  while (t--) {
    int xa, xb, ya, yb, za, zb;
    cin >> xa >> ya >> za >> xb >> yb >> zb;

    int mn = (za > yb) ? yb : za;
    za -= mn;
    yb -= mn;

    int ans = 2 * mn;
    zb -= za;

    int mn2 = zb - xa;
    if (mn2 < 0)
      mn2 = 0;

    ans -= 2 * mn2;

    cout << ans << '\n';
  }

  return 0;
}
```
