Step 1: Remove unnecessary includes

The program includes the entire "bits/stdc++.h" library, which is not necessary. We can remove it since it is not being used in the program.

Step 2: Optimize variable declarations

The program declares several variables in the global scope, which is not necessary. We can move the variable declarations inside the while loop, as they are only used within the loop.

Step 3: Simplify conditional statements

The program uses conditional statements to determine the minimum value between two variables. We can simplify these statements by using the min() function.

Step 4: Optimize calculations

The program performs several calculations that can be simplified. Instead of subtracting values and then adding them later, we can perform the calculations in a more efficient manner.

Step 5: Modify variable names

The variable names used in the program are not descriptive. We can modify them to make the code more readable and understandable.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int t;
  cin >> t;

  while (t--) {
    int xa, xb, ya, yb, za, zb;
    cin >> xa >> ya >> za >> xb >> yb >> zb;

    int ans = 0;
    int mn = min(za, yb);
    ans += (2 * mn);

    za -= mn;
    yb -= mn;

    int mn2 = max(zb - xa, 0);
    ans -= (2 * mn2);

    cout << ans << '\n';
  }

  return 0;
}
```
