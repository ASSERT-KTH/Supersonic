The given program calculates the value of `ans` for each test case based on the input values. The goal is to optimize the program for running time and memory usage.

Here are the steps to optimize the program:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` includes a large number of headers, which may not be required for this program. We can remove it and include only the necessary headers.

2. Remove unnecessary variables: The variables `mn` and `mn2` are used to store intermediate values that can be directly calculated without using extra variables.

3. Simplify conditional statements: The conditional statements can be simplified to reduce the number of comparisons and calculations.

4. Avoid unnecessary operations: There are some unnecessary operations, such as subtracting `za` from `zb` and then subtracting `xa` from `zb`, which can be avoided.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int t;
  cin >> t;
  
  while (t--) {
    int xa, xb, ya, yb, za, zb;
    cin >> xa >> ya >> za >> xb >> yb >> zb;
    
    int diff = min(za, yb); // calculate the minimum value of za and yb
    za -= diff;
    yb -= diff;
    
    int ans = 2 * diff; // update ans based on the minimum value
    int diff2 = max(0, zb - xa); // calculate the difference between zb and xa
    ans -= 2 * diff2; // subtract diff2 from ans
    
    cout << ans << '\n';
  }
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized program reduces unnecessary calculations and variables, simplifies conditional statements, and removes unnecessary operations. It should provide improved performance in terms of running time and memory usage.
