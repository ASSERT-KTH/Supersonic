The given program calculates the maximum sum of elements in an array with a few constraints. It uses a recursive function `f` to calculate the maximum sum.

To optimize the program, we can make the following modifications:
1. Remove unnecessary header files: The program includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header file, which includes a large number of standard library headers. We can remove this line and include only the required headers.
2. Remove unused macros: The program defines several macros (`ll`, `N`, `mod`, `dd`, etc.) that are not used. We can remove these macros to simplify the code.
3. Optimize the recursive function: The recursive function `f` can be optimized by using memoization. We can store the computed values in the `dp` array to avoid redundant calculations.
4. Use a bottom-up approach: Instead of using a recursive function, we can use a bottom-up approach to calculate the maximum sum. This avoids the overhead of function calls and improves performance.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cstring>
using namespace std;

const int MAX_N = 100005;
const int MAX_Z = 6;

int f(int n, int k, int z, int arr[]) {
    int dp[MAX_N][MAX_Z] = {0};
    int ans = arr[0];
    
    for (int i = 1; i <= k; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j <= z; j++) {
            int left = 0;
            int right = 0;
            
            if (j > 0 && i > 1) {
                left = dp[i - 1][j - 1];
            }
            
            right = dp[i - 1][j];
            
            dp[i][j] = arr[i] + max(left, right);
            
            if (i == k && j == z) {
                ans = max(ans, dp[i][j]);
            }
        }
    }
    
    return ans;
}

int main() {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(NULL);
    
    int t;
    cin >> t;
    
    while (t--) {
        int n, k, z;
        cin >> n >> k >> z;
        
        int arr[MAX_N];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            cin >> arr[i];
        }
        
        int ans = arr[0] + f(n, k, z, arr);
        cout << ans << endl;
    }
    
    return 0;
}
```

Explanation of the optimizations:
1. Removed unnecessary header files.
2. Removed unused macros.
3. Modified the `f` function to use a bottom-up approach. The `dp` array is initialized with 0 and stores the maximum sum at each position with a certain number of moves and a certain number of swaps. The final answer is updated at each iteration, and the function returns the maximum sum.
4. Removed the `memset` function call, as it is not needed in the optimized version.
