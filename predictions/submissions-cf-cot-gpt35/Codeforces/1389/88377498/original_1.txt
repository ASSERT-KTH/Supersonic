Step 1: Remove unnecessary headers
The program includes several unnecessary headers such as <bits/stdc++.h>, <cmath>, <cstdlib>, <cstring>, and <iostream>. We can remove these headers as they are not used in the program.

Step 2: Remove unnecessary macros
The program defines several unnecessary macros such as IOS, test, ses, whp, mxi, mp, PII, pf, sf, ff, ss, ALL, pb, rep0, rep1, rep0in, rep1in, repv, INF, CLR, PI, and what_is. We can remove these macros as they are not used in the program.

Step 3: Remove unnecessary typedefs
The program defines unnecessary typedefs such as v99 and ull. We can remove these typedefs as they are not used in the program.

Step 4: Remove unnecessary arrays
The program defines unnecessary arrays such as fx, fy, ox8, and oy8. We can remove these arrays as they are not used in the program.

Step 5: Remove unnecessary functions
The program defines unnecessary functions such as sort2val, gcd, lcm, and pw. We can remove these functions as they are not used in the program.

Step 6: Simplify the main function
The main function can be simplified by removing the "solve()" function call and directly placing its contents inside the main function.

Step 7: Optimize the logic
The current logic of the program can be optimized by removing redundant loops and variables. We can simplify the logic to find the maximum number of consecutive elements in the given string that can be removed. Instead of checking all possible pairs of numbers, we can iterate over the string and count the frequency of each number. Then, we can find the maximum frequency and subtract it from the total length of the string to get the minimum number of elements that need to be removed.

Here is the optimized C++ program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int t;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    string s;
    cin >> s;
    int cr_h = 0;
    int a[10] = {0};
    
    for (char c : s) {
      a[c - '0']++;
    }
    
    for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
      cr_h = max(cr_h, a[i]);
    }
    
    cout << s.size() - cr_h << endl;
  }
  
  return 0;
}
```
The optimized program removes unnecessary headers, macros, typedefs, arrays, and functions. It also simplifies the main function and optimizes the logic to improve the running time and memory usage.
