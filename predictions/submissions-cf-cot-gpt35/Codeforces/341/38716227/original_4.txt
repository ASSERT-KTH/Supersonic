Step 1: Optimize the includes
The program includes several unnecessary headers. We can remove them to improve compilation time and reduce memory usage.

Step 2: Optimize the namespace usage
The program currently uses the `__gnu_pbds` namespace, but it is not necessary. We can remove it to simplify the code.

Step 3: Optimize the macros
The program uses several macros that are not used. We can remove them to simplify the code and reduce memory usage.

Step 4: Optimize the data types
The program uses `int` for loop counters and array indices, but it can be optimized to use `ll` (long long) instead to support larger values.

Step 5: Optimize the function definitions
The program defines several functions that are not used. We can remove them to simplify the code.

Step 6: Optimize the constant definitions
The program defines several constants that are not used. We can remove them to simplify the code.

Step 7: Optimize the unnecessary calculations
The program performs several unnecessary calculations, such as calculating the square root. We can remove them to improve the running time.

Step 8: Optimize the unnecessary bitwise operations
The program uses bitwise operations that are not necessary. We can remove them to simplify the code.

Step 9: Optimize the unnecessary string conversions
The program converts integers to strings using `stringstream`, but it is not necessary. We can remove them to simplify the code.

Step 10: Optimize the unnecessary tree updates
The program updates the tree even when the value is 0, which is unnecessary. We can remove them to improve the running time.

Here is the optimized C++ program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

typedef long long ll;

const int mxn = 1010;
ll multree[mxn][mxn][2], addtree[mxn][mxn][2];

ll yo(ll x) {
  return (x % 2);
}

ll query2(ll tree[mxn][mxn][2], ll x, ll y) {
  ll mul = 0, add = 0;
  for (ll i = y; i > 0; i -= i & -i) {
    mul ^= tree[x][i][0];
    add ^= tree[x][i][1];
  }
  return (mul * yo(y)) ^ add;
}

ll query1(ll x, ll y) {
  ll mul = 0, add = 0;
  for (ll i = x; i > 0; i -= i & -i) {
    mul ^= query2(multree, i, y);
    add ^= query2(addtree, i, y);
  }
  return (mul * yo(x)) ^ add;
}

ll query(ll x1, ll y1, ll x2, ll y2) {
  return (query1(x2, y2) ^ query1(x1 - 1, y2) ^ query1(x2, y1 - 1) ^
          query1(x1 - 1, y1 - 1));
}

void upd2(ll tree[mxn][mxn][2], ll x, ll y, ll mul, ll add) {
  if (mul == 0 && add == 0) {
    return;
  }
  for (ll i = x; i < mxn; i += i & -i) {
    for (ll j = y; j < mxn; j += j & -j) {
      tree[i][j][0] ^= mul;
      tree[i][j][1] ^= add;
    }
  }
}

void upd1(ll x, ll y1, ll y2, ll mul, ll add) {
  upd2(multree, x, y1, mul, mul * yo(y1 - 1));
  upd2(multree, x, y2, mul, mul * yo(y2));
  upd2(addtree, x, y1, add, add * yo(y1 - 1));
  upd2(addtree, x, y2, add, add * yo(y2));
}

void upd(ll x1, ll y1, ll x2, ll y2, ll val) {
  upd1(x1, y1, y2, val, val * yo(x1 - 1));
  upd1(x2, y1, y2, val, val * yo(x2));
}

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);

  ll n, q, tt, x1, y1, x2, y2, val;
  cin >> n >> q;
  while (q--) {
    cin >> tt;
    if (tt == 2) {
      cin >> x1 >> y1 >> x2 >> y2 >> val;
      upd(x1, y1, x2, y2, val);
    } else {
      cin >> x1 >> y1 >> x2 >> y2;
      cout << query(x1, y1, x2, y2) << '\n';
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Explanation of optimizations:

1. Removed unnecessary headers.
2. Removed the `__gnu_pbds` namespace.
3. Removed unused macros.
4. Replaced `int` with `ll` for loop counters and array indices.
5. Removed unused functions.
6. Removed unused constants.
7. Removed unnecessary calculations, such as calculating the square root.
8. Removed unnecessary bitwise operations.
9. Removed unnecessary string conversions.
10. Skipped tree updates when the value is 0.
