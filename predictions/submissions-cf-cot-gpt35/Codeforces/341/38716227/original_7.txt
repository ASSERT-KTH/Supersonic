Step 1: Remove unnecessary includes and using statements.
- The program includes unnecessary headers and using statements that are not used in the code. These unnecessary components can be removed to improve the compilation time and reduce memory usage.

Step 2: Remove unnecessary macros and functions.
- The program defines a large number of macros and functions that are not used in the code. These unnecessary components can be removed to improve the compilation time and reduce memory usage.

Step 3: Simplify the implementation of the query functions.
- The query functions (query2, query1, and query) can be simplified to reduce the number of loops and improve the running time. The goal is to compute the XOR of multiple values efficiently.

Step 4: Simplify the implementation of the update functions.
- The update functions (upd2, upd1, and upd) can be simplified to reduce the number of loops and improve the running time. The goal is to update multiple values efficiently.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

const int mxn = 1010;

int multree[mxn][mxn][2], addtree[mxn][mxn][2];

int yo(int x) {
  return (x % 2);
}

int query2(int tree[mxn][mxn][2], int x, int y) {
  int mul = 0, add = 0;
  for (int i = y; i > 0; i -= i & -i) {
    mul ^= tree[x][i][0];
    add ^= tree[x][i][1];
  }
  return (mul * yo(y)) ^ add;
}

int query(int x1, int y1, int x2, int y2) {
  return (query2(multree, x2, y2) ^ query2(multree, x1 - 1, y2) ^ query2(multree, x2, y1 - 1) ^ query2(multree, x1 - 1, y1 - 1));
}

void upd2(int tree[mxn][mxn][2], int x, int y, int mul, int add) {
  for (int i = x; i < mxn; i += i & -i) {
    for (int j = y; j < mxn; j += j & -j) {
      tree[i][j][0] ^= mul;
      tree[i][j][1] ^= add;
    }
  }
}

void upd(int x1, int y1, int x2, int y2, int val) {
  upd2(multree, x1, y1, val, val * yo(y1 - 1));
  upd2(multree, x1, y2, val, val * yo(y2));
  upd2(multree, x2, y1, val, val * yo(y1 - 1));
  upd2(multree, x2, y2, val, val * yo(y2));
}

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);

  int n, q, tt, x1, y1, x2, y2, val;
  cin >> n >> q;

  while (q--) {
    cin >> tt;
    if (tt == 2) {
      cin >> x1 >> y1 >> x2 >> y2 >> val;
      upd(x1, y1, x2, y2, val);
    } else {
      cin >> x1 >> y1 >> x2 >> y2;
      cout << query(x1, y1, x2, y2) << endl;
    }
  }

  return 0;
}
```

Explanation of the optimization steps:

- Step 1: Unnecessary includes and using statements were removed to improve the compilation time and reduce memory usage.
- Step 2: Unnecessary macros and functions were removed to improve the compilation time and reduce memory usage.
- Step 3: The query functions were simplified by combining multiple loops into a single loop and removing unnecessary variables. This improves the running time by reducing the number of iterations.
- Step 4: The update functions were simplified by combining multiple loops into a single loop and removing unnecessary variables. This improves the running time by reducing the number of iterations.
