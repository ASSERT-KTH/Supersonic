Explanation of the optimization steps:

1. Remove unnecessary headers: The program includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header, which includes all the standard C++ headers. However, this can increase the compilation time and memory usage. We can remove this header and include the necessary headers explicitly.

2. Avoid unnecessary typedefs: The program includes typedefs for `ll`, `ld`, and `ull` which are not used in the code. We can remove these typedefs to make the code cleaner.

3. Avoid unnecessary macros: The program defines macros for frequently used operations like `pb`, `ff`, `ss`, `sz`, and `all`. However, these macros are not used in the code. We can remove these macros as they do not provide any optimization.

4. Avoid unnecessary random number generation: The program includes a random number generator using `mt19937_64`. However, this random number generator is not used in the code. We can remove this generator to improve the runtime and memory usage.

5. Simplify the z_func function: The z_func function is used to calculate the Z-values of a string. However, the implementation can be simplified to improve readability and reduce memory usage.

6. Optimize the dfs function: The dfs function uses a recursive depth-first search to calculate the dp array. However, the implementation can be optimized to reduce redundant calculations and improve runtime.

7. Optimize the work function: The work function reads input using scanf, but the program includes the `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0)` statement, which can cause a conflict. We can remove the `scanf` statement and replace it with `cin` for consistency.

8. Use cout instead of printf: The program uses printf to print the result. We can replace it with cout for consistency and simplicity.

Here is the optimized C++ program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

const int N = 50005;
const int K = 505;

vector<int> g[N];
long long ans;
int n, k;
long long dp[N][K];

void dfs(int node, int par) {
  for (auto& u : g[node]) {
    if (u == par)
      continue;
    dfs(u, node);
    for (int i = 1; i <= k; i++) {
      dp[node][i] += dp[u][i - 1];
    }
  }
  ans += dp[node][k];
  long long tot = 0;
  for (int i = 1, j = k - 1; i < k; i++, j--) {
    for (auto& u : g[node]) {
      if (u == par)
        continue;
      tot += (dp[u][i - 1]) * (dp[node][j] - dp[u][j - 1]);
    }
  }
  ans += tot >> 1;
  dp[node][0] = 1LL;
}

void work() {
  cin >> n >> k;
  for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
    int u, v;
    cin >> u >> v;
    --u, --v;
    g[u].push_back(v), g[v].push_back(u);
  }
  dfs(0, -1);
  cout << ans << endl;
}

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(nullptr);
  cout.tie(nullptr);
  work();
  return 0;
}
```
