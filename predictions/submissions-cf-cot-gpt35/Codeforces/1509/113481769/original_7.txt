The given program reads an integer `n`, followed by an array of `n` integers. It then separates the odd and even numbers into two separate vectors, `odd` and `even`. Finally, it prints the elements of `odd` followed by the elements of `even`.

To optimize this program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The program includes the entire `bits/stdc++.h` library, which is not necessary for this program. We can remove this line.

2. Remove unnecessary macros: The program defines macros for `IOS` and `endl`, which are not used in the program. We can remove these lines.

3. Remove unnecessary file I/O: The program includes a macro `frfr` for reading input from a file, but it is not used in the program. We can remove this line.

4. Use `reserve` for vectors: Instead of dynamically resizing the vectors `odd` and `even` as elements are added, we can use the `reserve` function to allocate memory in advance. Since we know the maximum possible size of `odd` and `even` is `n`, we can reserve memory for `n` elements.

5. Use `emplace_back` instead of `push_back`: Instead of using `push_back` to add elements to the vectors, we can use `emplace_back`, which constructs the element directly in the vector, avoiding unnecessary copies or moves.

6. Use `cout << " "` instead of `cout << " " << endl`: The program uses `cout << " "` to print a space after each element, followed by `cout << endl` to print a new line. We can optimize this by removing `endl` and using `cout << " "` instead, which will only flush the output buffer once at the end of the program.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

void solve(int te) {
  int n;
  std::cin >> n;
  std::vector<int> arr(n);
  std::vector<int> odd, even;
  odd.reserve(n);
  even.reserve(n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    std::cin >> arr[i];
    if (arr[i] % 2) {
      odd.emplace_back(arr[i]);
    } else {
      even.emplace_back(arr[i]);
    }
  }
  if (odd.size() >= even.size()) {
    for (int i : odd) {
      std::cout << i << " ";
    }
    for (int i : even) {
      std::cout << i << " ";
    }
  } else {
    for (int i : even) {
      std::cout << i << " ";
    }
    for (int i : odd) {
      std::cout << i << " ";
    }
  }
  std::cout << std::endl;
}

int main() {
  int te;
  std::cin >> te;
  for (int i = 1; i <= te; ++i) {
    solve(i);
  }
  return 0;
}
```
