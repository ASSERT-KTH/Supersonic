The given program reads an integer `te` from input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` from input, followed by an array of `n` integers. It then separates the odd and even integers into two separate vectors, `odd` and `even`. Finally, it prints the elements of `odd` followed by the elements of `even`.

To optimize the program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The program includes the entire `bits/stdc++.h` header, which is not necessary and can increase compile time. We can remove this include statement.

2. Replace `endl` with `'\n'`: The `endl` manipulator flushes the output buffer, which can be an expensive operation. We can replace `endl` with `'\n'` to only insert a newline character without flushing the buffer.

3. Avoid using dynamic memory allocation: The original program creates a dynamic array `arr` using `int arr[n]`. Dynamic memory allocation can be slower and less memory efficient than using a fixed-size array. We can replace this with a static array of a maximum size, or use a vector instead.

4. Use a single vector instead of two separate vectors: The original program separates the odd and even integers into two separate vectors, `odd` and `even`. This requires iterating over the array twice. We can optimize this by using a single vector and pushing odd elements to the back and even elements to the front. This way, we only need to iterate over the array once.

5. Avoid unnecessary function calls: The original program calls the `solve` function for each test case. This is an unnecessary function call and can be eliminated by moving the code from `solve` directly into `main`.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

#define IOS ios::sync_with_stdio(0); cin.tie(0); cout.tie(0);
#define endl '\n'
#define MAXN 100000

int main() {
    IOS;
    int te;
    std::cin >> te;
    while (te--) {
        int n;
        std::cin >> n;
        std::vector<int> arr(n);
        std::vector<int> combined;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            std::cin >> arr[i];
            if (arr[i] % 2) {
                combined.push_back(arr[i]);
            } else {
                combined.insert(combined.begin(), arr[i]);
            }
        }
        for (int i : combined) {
            std::cout << i << ' ';
        }
        std::cout << '\n';
    }
    return 0;
}
```

Explanation of optimizations:

1. We removed the unnecessary include statements.

2. We replaced `endl` with `'\n'` to avoid unnecessary buffer flush.

3. We replaced the dynamic array `int arr[n]` with a `std::vector<int> arr(n)`.

4. We replaced the separate `odd` and `even` vectors with a single `combined` vector. Odd elements are pushed to the back of the vector, while even elements are inserted at the beginning of the vector using `combined.insert(combined.begin(), arr[i])`.

5. We eliminated the `solve` function and moved the code directly into `main`.

These optimizations should improve the running time and memory usage of the program.
