The given program reads an integer `te` which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and an array of `n` integers. It then separates the odd and even elements of the array into two separate vectors, and prints the elements of the vectors alternatively.

To optimize the program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary headers: The program includes `<bits/stdc++.h>` which includes all the standard headers. However, this is not recommended as it increases the compilation time and may include unnecessary headers. We can remove this line and include only the necessary headers.

2. Avoid using `std::endl`: The `std::endl` manipulator flushes the output stream, which can be an expensive operation. Instead, we can use the newline character `'\n'` to improve the performance.

3. Avoid using `std::vector` for temporary storage: The program uses two vectors, `odd` and `even`, to store the odd and even elements of the array. However, we can avoid using vectors and instead use two pointers to keep track of the odd and even elements in the array.

With these optimizations in mind, here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

void solve(int te) {
    int n;
    std::cin >> n;
    int arr[n];

    int* odd = new int[n];
    int* even = new int[n];
    int oddCount = 0;
    int evenCount = 0;

    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        std::cin >> arr[i];
        if (arr[i] % 2) {
            odd[oddCount++] = arr[i];
        } else {
            even[evenCount++] = arr[i];
        }
    }

    if (oddCount >= evenCount) {
        for (int i = 0; i < oddCount; i++) {
            std::cout << odd[i] << ' ';
        }
        for (int i = 0; i < evenCount; i++) {
            std::cout << even[i] << ' ';
        }
    } else {
        for (int i = 0; i < evenCount; i++) {
            std::cout << even[i] << ' ';
        }
        for (int i = 0; i < oddCount; i++) {
            std::cout << odd[i] << ' ';
        }
    }

    std::cout << '\n';

    delete[] odd;
    delete[] even;
}

int main() {
    std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
    std::cin.tie(nullptr);

    int te;
    std::cin >> te;

    for (int i = 1; i <= te; ++i) {
        solve(i);
    }

    return 0;
}
```

Explanation of the optimizations:

1. Removed unnecessary headers: The program originally included `<bits/stdc++.h>`, which includes all standard headers. It is recommended to include only the necessary headers to reduce compilation time and avoid including unnecessary headers.

2. Avoided using `std::endl`: The program originally used `std::endl` to end each line of output. However, `std::endl` flushes the output stream, which can be an expensive operation. Instead, we used the newline character `'\n'` to improve performance.

3. Avoided using `std::vector` for temporary storage: The program originally used `std::vector` to store the odd and even elements of the array. However, using dynamic arrays (`int*`) with pointers is more memory-efficient and avoids the overhead of `std::vector` operations. The counts of odd and even elements are tracked separately (`oddCount` and `evenCount`), and the elements are stored in the dynamic arrays `odd` and `even`. Finally, the dynamic arrays are deleted using `delete[]` to free the memory.

These optimizations improve the running time and memory usage of the program.
