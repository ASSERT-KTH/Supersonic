The given program reads an integer `n`, followed by an array of `n` integers. It then separates the integers into two vectors, `odd` and `even`, based on whether they are odd or even. Finally, it prints the elements of `odd` followed by the elements of `even`.

To optimize this program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The program includes the entire `bits/stdc++.h` header, which is not necessary for this program. We can remove this include statement.

2. Avoid using `std::endl`: The program uses `std::endl` to print a newline character and flush the output buffer. However, flushing the output buffer after every line can significantly impact performance. We can replace `std::endl` with a newline character `'\n'` to improve performance.

3. Avoid using `std::vector` for odd and even numbers: The program uses `std::vector` to store odd and even numbers separately. However, since the size of the array is already known, we can use two fixed-size arrays `odd` and `even` instead of `std::vector`. This avoids the overhead of dynamic memory allocation and deallocation.

4. Avoid unnecessary range-based loops: The program uses range-based loops to print the elements of `odd` and `even` vectors. However, we can directly access the elements using indices, which can be slightly faster.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

#define IOS \
  std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false); \
  std::cin.tie(nullptr); \
  std::cout.tie(nullptr);

void solve(int te) {
  int n;
  std::cin >> n;
  int arr[n];
  int odd[n], even[n];
  int oddSize = 0, evenSize = 0;
  
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    std::cin >> arr[i];
    if (arr[i] % 2) {
      odd[oddSize++] = arr[i];
    } else {
      even[evenSize++] = arr[i];
    }
  }
  
  if (oddSize >= evenSize) {
    for (int i = 0; i < oddSize; i++) {
      std::cout << odd[i] << ' ';
    }
    for (int i = 0; i < evenSize; i++) {
      std::cout << even[i] << ' ';
    }
  } else {
    for (int i = 0; i < evenSize; i++) {
      std::cout << even[i] << ' ';
    }
    for (int i = 0; i < oddSize; i++) {
      std::cout << odd[i] << ' ';
    }
  }
  std::cout << '\n';
}

int main() {
  IOS;
  int te;
  std::cin >> te;
  
  for (int i = 1; i <= te; ++i) {
    solve(i);
  }
  
  return 0;
}
```

Explanation:
- Removed unnecessary includes.
- Replaced `std::endl` with `'\n'`.
- Replaced `std::vector` with fixed-size arrays `odd` and `even` to avoid dynamic memory allocation.
- Replaced range-based loops with regular loops to access elements directly using indices.
