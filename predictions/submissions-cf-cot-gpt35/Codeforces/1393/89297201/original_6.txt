Step 1: Remove unnecessary includes

The program includes `<bits/stdc++.h>` which is not necessary for this program. We can remove it.

Step 2: Optimize the loop

The loop `for (i = 1; i <= n; i++)` can be optimized by starting the loop from 0 instead of 1. This will save one iteration.

Step 3: Optimize the counting logic

The logic for counting even and divisible by 4 numbers can be simplified. We can keep track of the count of even and divisible by 4 numbers in separate variables instead of checking the condition every time.

Step 4: Optimize the query loop

The loop `for (cin >> q; q--;)` can be optimized by decrementing `q` within the loop condition itself. This will save one line of code.

Step 5: Optimize the query processing logic

The logic for processing the queries can be simplified by checking for the conditions in reverse order. If `p` is greater than 0, we can skip checking `k` altogether. This will save unnecessary comparisons.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

const int MAXN = 1000000;
int n, q, a[MAXN], d[MAXN], k = 0, p = 0;
char c;

int main() {
  cin >> n;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> a[i];
    d[a[i]]++;
    if (d[a[i]] % 2 == 0)
      k++;
    if (d[a[i]] % 4 == 0)
      p++;
  }
  
  cin >> q;
  while (q--) {
    cin >> c;
    cin >> x;
    
    if (c == '+') {
      d[x]++;
      if (d[x] % 4 == 0)
        p++;
      if (d[x] % 2 == 0)
        k++;
    } else {
      d[x]--;
      if (d[x] % 2 != 0)
        k--;
      if (d[x] % 4 == 3)
        p--;
    }
    
    if (p > 0) {
      cout << "YES\n";
    } else if (k >= 4) {
      cout << "YES\n";
    } else {
      cout << "NO\n";
    }
  }
}
```
