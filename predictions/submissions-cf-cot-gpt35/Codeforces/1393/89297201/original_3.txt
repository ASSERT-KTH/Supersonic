To optimize the given program, we can make the following changes:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The current program includes `<bits/stdc++.h>` which includes all the standard C++ libraries. We can remove it as it is not required.

2. Use a smaller data type for array indices: The variable `i` is used as an array index for `a` and `d`. We can use `int` instead of `long long` as the array index because the maximum value of `n` is given as 10^6.

3. Use a smaller data type for array sizes: The array `a` and `d` are declared with a size of 10^6. We can use a smaller size for these arrays based on the maximum value of `n` given.

4. Avoid unnecessary modulo operations: Instead of checking if `d[a[i]] % 2 == 0` and `d[a[i]] % 4 == 0`, we can use a counter variable to keep track of the number of even and multiple of 4 occurrences.

5. Avoid unnecessary checks: Instead of checking `k >= 4 && p > 0` for every query, we can check it once after all the queries are processed.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int n, q;
  cin >> n;
  
  int a[n+1] = {0};
  int d[n+1] = {0};
  int k = 0, p = 0;

  for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    cin >> a[i];
    d[a[i]]++;
    if (d[a[i]] == 2)
      k++;
    if (d[a[i]] == 4)
      p++;
  }

  cin >> q;
  while (q--) {
    char c;
    int x;
    cin >> c >> x;
    if (c == '+') {
      d[x]++;
      if (d[x] == 4)
        p++;
      if (d[x] == 2)
        k++;
    } else {
      d[x]--;
      if (d[x] == 3)
        p--;
      if (d[x] == 1)
        k--;
    }
  }

  if (k >= 4 && p > 0)
    cout << "YES\n";
  else
    cout << "NO\n";

  return 0;
}
```

By making these optimizations, we have reduced the memory usage and improved the running time of the program.
