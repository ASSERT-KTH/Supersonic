The given program is counting the occurrences of elements in an array and checking if certain conditions are met based on the counts. The program uses an array `d` to keep track of the counts of elements in the array `a`.

To optimize the program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Instead of using the `bits/stdc++.h` header, we can include only the necessary headers: `iostream` and `unordered_map` to reduce unnecessary overhead.

2. We can use `unordered_map` instead of an array to count the occurrences of elements in `a`. This will reduce the memory usage as we don't need to initialize a large array.

3. Instead of checking for even and divisible by 4 conditions separately, we can combine them into a single condition by using the modulo operator `% 4` and checking if it equals 0.

4. We can move the check for `k >= 4 && p > 0` outside the loop and store the result in a variable. This way, we don't need to perform the check in every iteration of the loop.

Here is the optimized C++ program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    int n;
    cin >> n;

    unordered_map<int, int> d;

    int k = 0, p = 0;

    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        int x;
        cin >> x;
        d[x]++;
        if (d[x] % 2 == 0)
            k++;
        if (d[x] % 4 == 0)
            p++;
    }

    int q;
    cin >> q;

    bool conditionMet = (k >= 4 && p > 0);

    while (q--) {
        char c;
        int x;
        cin >> c >> x;

        if (c == '+') {
            d[x]++;
            if (d[x] % 4 == 0)
                p++;
            if (d[x] % 2 == 0)
                k++;
        } else {
            d[x]--;
            if (d[x] % 4 == 3)
                p--;
            if (d[x] % 2 != 0)
                k--;
        }

        if (conditionMet)
            cout << "YES\n";
        else
            cout << "NO\n";
    }

    return 0;
}
```

Explanation:

1. We removed the unnecessary `bits/stdc++.h` header and included only the necessary headers `iostream` and `unordered_map`.

2. We replaced the `long long` variables with `int` variables as the size of the array is limited to 1000000, which can be represented by an `int`.

3. We replaced the array `a` with an `unordered_map<int, int> d` to count the occurrences of elements. This reduces the memory usage as we only store the counts for the elements that actually appear in the input.

4. We moved the declaration of `k` and `p` inside the main function and initialized them to 0.

5. We moved the check for `k >= 4 && p > 0` outside the loop and stored the result in the boolean variable `conditionMet`.

6. In the loop, we replaced the `for` loop with a `while` loop and used the `--` operator to decrement `q` in each iteration.

7. We replaced the `cin >> q` statement with `int q; cin >> q;` to declare and initialize `q` in a single line.

8. We replaced the `cout << "YES\n"` and `cout << "NO\n"` statements with a single `if-else` statement using the `conditionMet` variable.
