The given program calculates the number of squares that can be formed in a grid with the same color in all four corners. The program uses four 2D arrays to store the lengths of squares in each direction. Then, it calculates the total number of squares by adding the minimum length from each direction.

To optimize the program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The program includes several unnecessary header files such as `<map>`, `<queue>`, `<set>`, etc. Since these headers are not used in the program, we can remove them to improve compilation time and reduce memory usage.

2. Remove unnecessary macros: The program defines several macros such as `DEBUG`, `fi`, `se`, `pqueue`, etc. These macros are not used in the program and can be safely removed.

3. Remove unnecessary typedefs: The program defines several typedefs for different types such as `vi`, `vvi`, `vull`, etc. These typedefs are not used in the program and can be safely removed.

4. Remove unnecessary constants: The program defines several constants such as `inf`, `infll`, `MOD`, etc. These constants are not used in the program and can be safely removed.

5. Remove unnecessary functions: The program defines a function `fast_io()` which is not used in the program. This function can be safely removed.

6. Optimize loop bounds: In the nested loops where the arrays `ul`, `ur`, `dl`, and `dr` are filled, the loop bounds can be optimized to avoid unnecessary iterations. For example, in the loop `for (int i = 1; i < n; i++)`, the loop can start from `i=1` instead of `i=0` because the arrays are initialized with `0`.

7. Optimize memory usage: The arrays `ul`, `ur`, `dl`, and `dr` are declared with a fixed size of `maxn` which is `2007`. However, the problem statement does not mention any specific constraint on the size of the grid. To optimize memory usage, we can dynamically allocate memory for these arrays based on the input size `n` and `m`.

Here's the optimized program:

```cpp
#pragma GCC optimize("unroll-loops")
#pragma GCC optimize("fast-math")
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

void solve() {
    int n, m;
    cin >> n >> m;

    vector<vector<char>> kek(n, vector<char>(m));
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < m; j++) {
            cin >> kek[i][j];
        }
    }

    vector<vector<int>> ul(n, vector<int>(m));
    vector<vector<int>> ur(n, vector<int>(m));
    vector<vector<int>> dl(n, vector<int>(m));
    vector<vector<int>> dr(n, vector<int>(m));

    for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
        for (int j = 1; j < m; j++) {
            if (kek[i][j] == kek[i - 1][j] && kek[i][j] == kek[i][j - 1]) {
                ul[i][j] = min(ul[i - 1][j], ul[i][j - 1]) + 1;
            }
        }
    }

    for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
        for (int j = m - 2; j >= 0; j--) {
            if (kek[i][j] == kek[i - 1][j] && kek[i][j] == kek[i][j + 1]) {
                ur[i][j] = min(ur[i - 1][j], ur[i][j + 1]) + 1;
            }
        }
    }

    for (int i = n - 2; i >= 0; i--) {
        for (int j = 1; j < m; j++) {
            if (kek[i][j] == kek[i + 1][j] && kek[i][j] == kek[i][j - 1]) {
                dl[i][j] = min(dl[i + 1][j], dl[i][j - 1]) + 1;
            }
        }
    }

    for (int i = n - 2; i >= 0; i--) {
        for (int j = m - 2; j >= 0; j--) {
            if (kek[i][j] == kek[i + 1][j] && kek[i][j] == kek[i][j + 1]) {
                dr[i][j] = min(dr[i + 1][j], dr[i][j + 1]) + 1;
            }
        }
    }

    int ans = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < m; j++) {
            ans += min(ul[i][j], min(ur[i][j], min(dl[i][j], dr[i][j]))) + 1;
        }
    }

    cout << ans << endl;
}

int main() {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(NULL);
    cout.tie(NULL);

    int q = 1;
    while (q--)
        solve();

    return 0;
}
```

This optimized program removes unnecessary code, optimizes loop bounds, and dynamically allocates memory for the arrays. It should have improved running time and reduced memory usage compared to the original program.
