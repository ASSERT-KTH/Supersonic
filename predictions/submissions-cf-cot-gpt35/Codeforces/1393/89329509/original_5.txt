Step 1: Remove unnecessary headers
- The program includes several headers that are not used in the code. We can remove them to improve compile time and reduce memory usage.

Step 2: Remove unused macros and typedefs
- The program defines several macros and typedefs that are not used in the code. We can remove them to improve compile time and reduce memory usage.

Step 3: Optimize loop conditions
- The program uses nested loops to iterate over the 2D array. However, the loop conditions can be optimized to reduce the number of iterations.
- In the first two nested loops, the loop conditions can be changed to `i < n-1` and `j < m-1` respectively. This eliminates unnecessary iteration when `i = n-1` or `j = m-1`.

Step 4: Optimize loop iteration order
- The program uses nested loops to iterate over the 2D array. However, the loop iteration order can be optimized to improve cache locality and reduce memory access time.
- In the first two nested loops, we can change the iteration order to `j` then `i`. This allows for better memory access patterns when accessing elements in the 2D array.

Step 5: Optimize variable initialization
- The program initializes the `ans` variable to 0 before the loop. However, this is not necessary as the variable will be overwritten in the loop. We can remove the initialization step to improve performance.

Here is the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#pragma GCC target(                                                            \
    "sse,sse2,sse3,ssse3,sse4,popcnt,abm,mmx,avx,avx2,tune=native")
#pragma GCC optimize("unroll-loops")
#pragma GCC optimize("fast-math")
#include <iostream>
#include <iomanip>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

const int maxn = 2e3 + 7;
int ul[maxn][maxn];
int ur[maxn][maxn];
int dl[maxn][maxn];
int dr[maxn][maxn];
char kek[maxn][maxn];

void solve() {
  int n, m;
  cin >> n >> m;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j < m; j++) {
      cin >> kek[i][j];
    }
  }
  int ans = 0;
  for (int j = 0; j < m-1; j++) {
    for (int i = 0; i < n-1; i++) {
      if (kek[i][j] == kek[i + 1][j] && kek[i][j] == kek[i][j + 1]) {
        dl[i][j] = min(dl[i + 1][j], dl[i][j - 1]) + 1;
        dr[i][j] = min(dr[i + 1][j], dr[i][j + 1]) + 1;
      }
      if (kek[i][j] == kek[i - 1][j] && kek[i][j] == kek[i][j - 1]) {
        ul[i][j] = min(ul[i - 1][j], ul[i][j - 1]) + 1;
        ur[i][j] = min(ur[i - 1][j], ur[i][j + 1]) + 1;
      }
      ans += min(ul[i][j], min(ur[i][j], min(dl[i][j], dr[i][j]))) + 1;
    }
  }
  cout << ans << endl;
}

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0);
  cin.tie(0);
  cout << fixed << setprecision(8);
  int q = 1;
  while (q--)
    solve();
}
