Step 1: Remove unnecessary includes

In the given program, the `bits/stdc++.h` header is included, which is not a standard C++ header and can lead to portability issues. We should remove it.

Step 2: Remove unused functions

There are several functions defined in the program that are not used. We can remove them to improve readability and reduce the size of the code.

Step 3: Optimize the loop limits

In the main loop where we calculate the sum, the upper limit of the loop is set to `1e5`, which is unnecessarily large. We can optimize it by setting the upper limit to the maximum value of the array element. This will reduce the number of iterations and improve the running time of the program.

Step 4: Remove unnecessary checks

In the inner loop, there are several unnecessary checks for the range of the sum and the power calculation. Since the input values are within the range of `1e18`, we can safely assume that the sum and the power calculation will not exceed this range. Therefore, we can remove these checks to improve the running time of the program.

Step 5: Simplify the condition for skipping iterations

In the inner loop, there is a condition `if (!dont)` to check if we should skip the current iteration. Instead of setting `dont` to 1 and breaking the loop, we can simplify the condition to `if (sum > ans)`. If the current sum is already greater than the current answer, we can skip the remaining iterations and move to the next value of `i`.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <cmath>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(nullptr);
  
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  
  vector<int> arr(n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> arr[i];
  }
  
  sort(arr.begin(), arr.end());
  
  long long ans = 1e18;
  
  int maxVal = *max_element(arr.begin(), arr.end());
  for (int i = 0; i <= maxVal; i++) {
    long long sum = 0;
    for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
      sum += abs(arr[j] - pow(i, j));
      if (sum > ans) {
        break;
      }
    }
    ans = min(ans, sum);
  }
  
  cout << ans << endl;
  
  return 0;
}
```
