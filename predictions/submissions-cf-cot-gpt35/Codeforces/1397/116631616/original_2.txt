To optimize the given C/C++ program, we can make the following steps:

1. Remove unnecessary include statements: The `bits/stdc++.h` header includes a large number of standard library headers, which can increase the compilation time and memory usage. We should only include the necessary headers for our program. In this case, we only need `<iostream>` and `<vector>`. Therefore, we can remove the `#include "bits/stdc++.h"` line.

2. Remove unused functions and variables: The program contains several functions that are not used in the main code. We can remove these unused functions (`checkPrime`, `to_int`, `gcd`, `lcm`, `sumofDigits`, `isPalindrome`, `toBinary`, `toDecimal`, `modInverse`, `NcR`, `seive`, `isPowerof2`, `ceil`, `rotateArray`, `kadaneAlgo`, and their respective helper functions) to simplify the code and reduce memory usage.

3. Remove unnecessary macros: The macros `fi`, `se`, `ld`, `pi`, `ReadInputFile`, and `print2d` are not used in the program. We can remove these macros to simplify the code.

4. Remove unnecessary debug and print statements: The program contains several debug and print statements that are not necessary for the final optimized program. We can remove these statements to improve the program's running time.

5. Optimize the loop limits: The loop limits in the nested loop can be optimized. The current loop limit for the outer loop is `1e5`, which is unnecessarily large. We can reduce it to `n` since we only need to iterate through the elements of the input vector `arr`. The loop limit for the inner loop can be optimized based on the maximum value of `j` in each iteration. We can calculate the maximum value of `j` using the formula `log(arr[n-1]) / log(i)` and use it as the loop limit.

6. Avoid unnecessary calculations: The program calculates `pow(i, j)` in each iteration of the inner loop. This calculation can be avoided by storing the previous value of `pow(i, j)` in a variable and updating it in each iteration.

Here is the optimized C++ program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <cmath>

using namespace std;

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(nullptr);

  int n;
  cin >> n;

  vector<int> arr(n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> arr[i];
  }

  sort(arr.begin(), arr.end());

  long long ans = 1e18;

  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    long long sum = 0, dont = 0;
    long long pow_ij = 1;
    for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
      if (pow_ij > 1e18 || sum > 1e18 || pow_ij < 0 || sum < 0) {
        dont = 1;
        break;
      }
      sum += abs(arr[j] - pow_ij);
      pow_ij *= i;
    }
    if (!dont) {
      ans = min(ans, sum);
    }
  }

  cout << ans << endl;

  return 0;
}
```

By making these optimizations, we have simplified the code and reduced unnecessary computations, which should improve the program's running time and memory usage.
