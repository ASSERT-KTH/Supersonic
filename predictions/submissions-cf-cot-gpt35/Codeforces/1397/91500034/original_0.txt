To optimize the given program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary header files: The program includes `<bits/stdc++.h>` which includes a lot of unnecessary header files. We can remove this line and include only the necessary header files, such as `<iostream>` and `<algorithm>`.

2. Remove unnecessary macros: The program defines macros for `gcd`, `lcm`, `rep`, and `mem`, but they are not used in the program. We can remove these macros.

3. Remove unnecessary variables and initialization: The variables `INF` and `maxn` are defined but not used in the program. We can remove these variables. Also, the variable `sum` can be initialized inside the loop to avoid unnecessary assignment.

4. Use `pow` function only once: The program uses the `pow` function inside the inner loop, which can be computationally expensive. We can calculate the powers of `c` outside the loop and store them in an array.

5. Use a more efficient loop condition: The current loop condition `c <= 1000000` is not efficient. We can use a more efficient condition such as `c <= *max_element(a, a + n)` to avoid unnecessary iterations.

6. Use `accumulate` function instead of a loop: The program uses a loop to calculate the sum of elements in the array `a`. We can use the `accumulate` function from the `<numeric>` header to calculate the sum in a more concise way.

7. Use a more efficient algorithm: The current algorithm iterates through all possible values of `c` and calculates the sum for each value. We can optimize this by using a binary search algorithm to find the optimal value of `c` instead.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>
#include <numeric>
#include <cmath>

using namespace std;

int main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(0);
  cin.tie(0);
  cout.tie(0);

  int n;
  cin >> n;

  int a[n];
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> a[i];
  }

  sort(a, a + n);

  int ans = accumulate(a, a + n, 0);
  int powers[n];
  powers[0] = 1;

  for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
    powers[i] = powers[i - 1] * c;
  }

  int left = 1;
  int right = *max_element(a, a + n);
  int best_c = 0;

  while (left <= right) {
    int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
    int sum = 0;

    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      sum += abs(powers[i] - a[i]);
      if (sum >= ans) {
        break;
      }
    }

    if (sum < ans) {
      ans = sum;
      best_c = mid;
      left = mid + 1;
    } else {
      right = mid - 1;
    }
  }

  cout << ans << endl;

  return 0;
}
```
