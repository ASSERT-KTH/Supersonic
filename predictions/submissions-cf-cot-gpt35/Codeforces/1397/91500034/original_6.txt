The given program can be optimized in the following steps:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The program includes `<bits/stdc++.h>`, which includes a large number of standard library headers. This can increase the compilation time and may not be necessary for this specific program. We can remove this line and include only the necessary headers.

2. Remove unused macros: The program defines some macros like `ll`, `gcd`, `lcm`, `rep`, `mem`, and `IOS`. However, these macros are not used in the program, so we can remove them.

3. Avoid using `pow()` function in the inner loop: The inner loop uses the `pow()` function to calculate the power of `c` for each index `i`. The `pow()` function is computationally expensive and can be avoided by using a variable to store the power of `c` and updating it in each iteration.

4. Optimize the sum calculation: Instead of calculating the absolute difference between `pow(c, i)` and `a[i]` in each iteration, we can optimize it by using a running sum. We can subtract the previous value of `pow(c, i-1)` from the sum and add the current value of `pow(c, i)`. This way, we avoid redundant calculations.

5. Limit the range of `c` and early termination: The original program iterates over all values of `c` from 1 to 1000000. However, we can limit the range of `c` based on the maximum value in the array `a`. We can find the maximum value of `a` using the `max_element()` function and then iterate from 1 to the ceiling of the logarithm (base `c`) of the maximum value. Additionally, we can terminate the loop early if the running sum exceeds the current answer.

6. Use `int` instead of `ll` for variables: The program uses `ll` (long long) for variables like `n`, `c`, `sum`, `ans`, and `a`. However, based on the constraints given in the program, we can safely use `int` instead of `ll` to save memory.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>
#include <cmath>

const int maxn = 1e5 + 5;

int n, ans = 0, a[maxn];

int main() {
  std::cin >> n;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    std::cin >> a[i];
    ans += a[i];
  }
  std::sort(a, a + n);
  
  int maxVal = *std::max_element(a, a + n);
  int ceiling = std::ceil(std::log2(maxVal));
  
  for (int c = 1; c <= ceiling; c++) {
    int powc = 1;
    int sum = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      sum += std::abs(powc - a[i]);
      powc *= c;
      if (sum >= ans)
        break;
    }
    ans = std::min(ans, sum);
  }
  
  std::cout << ans << std::endl;
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized program should have improved running time and reduced memory usage compared to the original program.
