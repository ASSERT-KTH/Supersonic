The given program is written with a lot of unnecessary macros and includes a lot of unnecessary headers. Additionally, it uses a 2D array to store characters, which can be optimized to store boolean values instead.

Here are the steps to optimize the program:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The program includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header, which is not standard and includes a large number of header files. We can remove this include and include only the necessary headers.

2. Remove unnecessary macros: The program defines a lot of macros that are not used. We can remove these macros to simplify the code.

3. Optimize memory usage: The program uses a 2D array of characters to store the input. Since the input consists of only two characters ('.' and '#'), we can optimize the memory usage by using a 2D array of boolean values instead.

4. Remove unnecessary calculations: The program performs unnecessary calculations when counting the number of consecutive characters. We can simplify these calculations.

5. Optimize the counting loop: The program uses nested loops to count the number of consecutive characters. We can optimize this loop by using prefix sums.

6. Optimize the query loop: The program uses nested loops to calculate the result for each query. We can optimize this loop by using prefix sums.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

typedef long long LL;

int main() {
    ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(0);

    LL n, m;
    cin >> n >> m;

    vector<vector<bool>> a(n + 1, vector<bool>(m + 1));
    for (LL i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        for (LL j = 1; j <= m; j++) {
            char c;
            cin >> c;
            a[i][j] = (c == '.');
        }
    }

    vector<vector<LL>> ng(n + 1, vector<LL>(m + 1));
    vector<vector<LL>> dc(n + 1, vector<LL>(m + 1));

    for (LL i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        for (LL j = 1; j <= m; j++) {
            ng[i][j] = ng[i][j - 1] + a[i][j - 1];
            dc[i][j] = dc[i - 1][j] + a[i - 1][j];
        }
    }

    LL q;
    cin >> q;
    while (q--) {
        LL t, x, b, y, res = 0;
        cin >> t >> x >> b >> y;
        for (LL i = t; i <= b; i++) {
            res += ng[i][y] - ng[i][x - 1];
            if (a[i][x] && a[i][x - 1])
                res--;
        }
        for (LL i = x; i <= y; i++) {
            res += dc[b][i] - dc[t - 1][i];
            if (a[t][i] && a[t - 1][i])
                res--;
        }
        cout << res << endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

Explanation of the optimization steps:

1. Removed unnecessary includes: The unnecessary includes were removed and only the necessary headers were kept.

2. Removed unnecessary macros: All unnecessary macros were removed to simplify the code.

3. Optimized memory usage: The 2D array `a` was changed to store boolean values instead of characters, reducing memory usage.

4. Removed unnecessary calculations: The unnecessary calculations when counting the number of consecutive characters were simplified.

5. Optimized the counting loop: The counting loop was optimized by using prefix sums to calculate the number of consecutive characters.

6. Optimized the query loop: The query loop was optimized by using prefix sums to calculate the result for each query.
