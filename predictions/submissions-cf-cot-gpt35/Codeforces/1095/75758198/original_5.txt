Step 1: Remove unnecessary string initialization

The variable `t` is initialized as an empty string `""` but it is later assigned a value from user input. We can remove this unnecessary initialization.

Step 2: Remove unnecessary condition check

The condition `if (b < n)` is unnecessary because `b` starts at 0 and is incremented by `i`, which starts at 1 and increases by 1 in each iteration. Therefore, `b` will never exceed `n` and the condition check is redundant.

Step 3: Improve variable naming

The variable `b` is not descriptive. We can rename it to `index` to better convey its purpose.

Optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int n;
  cin >> n;

  string t;
  cin >> t;

  int index = 0;
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    cout << t[index];
    index += i;
  }
}
```
