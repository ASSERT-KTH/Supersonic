Step 1: Remove unnecessary string variable

The first optimization we can make is to remove the unnecessary string variable `t`. We only use this variable to read input from `cin`, and then access its characters one by one. Instead, we can directly read the characters from `cin` into an integer array.

Step 2: Use a more efficient loop condition

The current loop condition `b < n` is not efficient because it keeps checking the condition in each iteration. We can optimize this by changing the condition to `b + i <= n`. This way, we only need to check the condition once per iteration.

Step 3: Output characters directly

Instead of storing the characters and then outputting them one by one, we can output the characters directly without storing them. This saves memory usage.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  
  int b = 0;
  for (int i = 1; b + i <= n; i++) {
    cout << char(cin.get());
    b += i;
  }
}
```
