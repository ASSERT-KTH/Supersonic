Step 1: Avoid unnecessary string concatenation
The original program appends characters to the string `t` using the `+=` operator inside the loop. This operation has a time complexity of O(n^2), which can be avoided.

Step 2: Use `cout` for output directly
The original program uses the `cout` statement inside the loop to print each character. Instead, we can store the characters in an array and print them outside the loop.

Step 3: Optimize the loop condition
The loop condition `b < n` is redundant since `b` will always be less than `n` inside the loop. We can remove this condition to improve performance.

Step 4: Optimize the loop increment
The original program increments `b` by `i` in each iteration. However, we can optimize this by using a formula to directly calculate the next value of `b` without needing to iterate.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  
  string t;
  cin >> t;
  
  char result[n];
  int b = 0;
  
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    result[i] = t[b];
    b += i + 1;
  }
  
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cout << result[i];
  }
}
```
