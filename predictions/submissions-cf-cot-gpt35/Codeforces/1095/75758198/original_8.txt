The given program reads an integer `n` and a string `t` from the input. It then prints characters from the string `t` at positions `b`, `b+i`, `b+2i`, ..., where `b` starts from 0 and `i` increases by 1 in each iteration of the loop until it reaches `n`.

To optimize this program, we can eliminate unnecessary variables and simplify the loop condition.

1. We can remove the `using namespace std;` line to avoid importing the entire `std` namespace. Instead, we can use the `std::` prefix for the required standard library functions and classes.

2. We don't need to store the input string `t` in a separate variable. We can directly read and process the characters from the input.

3. Instead of incrementing `i` in each iteration and checking if `b < n` in the loop condition, we can update the value of `b` directly using the formula `b += i`. This will eliminate the need for the `i` variable and simplify the loop condition.

4. Instead of printing the characters one by one, we can concatenate them to a string and print the final string at the end. This will reduce the number of output operations.

With these optimizations in mind, here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  int n;
  std::cin >> n;

  std::string output;
  for (int b = 0, i = 1; b < n; i++) {
    output += std::cin.get();
    b += i;
  }

  std::cout << output;
  return 0;
}
```
