The original program reads an integer `n` and a string `t` from the user. It then iterates over the string `t` and prints characters at specific indices based on the variable `i`. The variable `b` is used to keep track of the current index in `t`.

To optimize the program for running time and memory usage, we can make a few modifications:

1. Remove the unnecessary `using namespace std;` line. It is generally considered a good practice to avoid using the entire `std` namespace.

2. Instead of using `std::string`, we can use a character array (`char[]`) to store the input string `t`. This will save memory as we don't need the extra functionalities provided by `std::string` for this specific task.

3. Instead of printing each character individually, we can store the characters in another character array (`char[]`) and print the final result at once. This will reduce the number of print statements and improve the program's efficiency.

Here's the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  int n;
  std::cin >> n;
  
  char t[100];
  std::cin >> t;

  char result[100];
  int b = 0;
  int index = 0;
  
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    if (b < n) {
      result[index++] = t[b];
      b += i;
    }
  }
  
  result[index] = '\0';
  std::cout << result << std::endl;

  return 0;
}
```

Explanation:
1. We removed the unnecessary `using namespace std;` line.
2. Replaced `std::string t = "";` with a character array `char t[100];`. This saves memory as we don't need the extra functionalities provided by `std::string`.
3. Created another character array `char result[100];` to store the final result.
4. Introduced a new variable `index` to keep track of the current index in `result`.
5. Instead of printing each character individually, we store the characters in `result` array using `result[index++] = t[b];`.
6. After the loop, we add a null character `'\0'` at the end of `result` to mark the end of the string.
7. Finally, we print the `result` array using `std::cout << result << std::endl;`.

These modifications optimize the program for running time by reducing the number of print statements and improve memory usage by using a character array instead of `std::string`.
