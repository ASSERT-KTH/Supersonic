The given program is using a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm to find the minimum cost of visiting all nodes in a directed graph. The program uses two DFS functions, `dfs` and `dfs2`, to traverse the graph and calculate the minimum cost. It also uses a stack to keep track of the order in which nodes are visited.

To optimize the program, we can make the following improvements:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The program includes the entire `<bits/stdc++.h>` header, which is not recommended as it slows down compilation and increases memory usage. We can remove this include statement and only include the necessary headers.

2. Use `vector.reserve` to reserve memory for vectors: The program uses two vectors, `v1` and `v2`, to store the graph. By reserving memory for these vectors before adding elements, we can avoid frequent reallocation and improve performance.

3. Use range-based for loops: Instead of using an index-based loop, we can use range-based for loops to iterate through the vectors. This can improve readability and potentially optimize the loop internally.

4. Use `emplace_back` instead of `push_back`: Instead of using `push_back` to add elements to the vectors, we can use `emplace_back` to construct and add elements directly to the vector, avoiding unnecessary copies.

5. Use `scanf` instead of `cin` for input: The program uses `cin` to read input, which can be slower compared to `scanf`. We can replace `cin` with `scanf` for reading integers from standard input.

6. Use `cout` instead of `printf` for output: The program uses `printf` to print the result, which is slower compared to `cout`. We can replace `printf` with `cout` for printing the result.

Here is the optimized program with the above optimizations:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <stack>

using namespace std;

const int MAX_N = 200010;

vector<int> v1[MAX_N];
vector<int> v2[MAX_N];
int cost[MAX_N];
int par[MAX_N];
bool vis[MAX_N];
stack<int> st;

long long temp;

void dfs(int source) {
  vis[source] = true;
  for (int v : v1[source]) {
    if (!vis[v]) {
      dfs(v);
    }
  }
  st.push(source);
}

void dfs2(int source, int val) {
  temp = min(temp, static_cast<long long>(cost[source]));
  vis[source] = false;
  par[source] = val;
  for (int v : v2[source]) {
    if (vis[v]) {
      dfs2(v, val);
    }
  }
}

int main() {
  int n;
  scanf("%d", &n);
  
  for (int i = 0; i < MAX_N; i++) {
    par[i] = i;
    v1[i].reserve(MAX_N);
    v2[i].reserve(MAX_N);
  }
  
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    scanf("%d", &cost[i]);
  }
  
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    int x;
    scanf("%d", &x);
    v1[i].emplace_back(x);
    v2[x].emplace_back(i);
  }
  
  long long ans = 0;
  
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    if (!vis[i]) {
      dfs(i);
    }
  }
  
  while (!st.empty()) {
    int top = st.top();
    st.pop();
    if (vis[top]) {
      temp = 10000000000;
      dfs2(top, top);
      cost[top] = temp;
      ans += temp;
    }
  }
  
  for (int i = 0; i < MAX_N; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j < v1[i].size(); j++) {
      int child = v1[i][j];
      if (par[i] != par[child]) {
        ans -= cost[par[i]];
        cost[par[i]] = 0;
      }
    }
  }
  
  cout << ans << endl;
  
  return 0;
}
```

By applying these optimizations, we have improved the performance of the program by reducing memory reallocations, using more efficient input/output methods, and making code improvements.
