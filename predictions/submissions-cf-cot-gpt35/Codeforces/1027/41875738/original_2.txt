The given program has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the graph. The program uses two depth-first searches (DFS) to find the connected components and update the costs. It also updates the parents and checks for connected components. However, there are a few optimizations that can be made to improve the program's efficiency:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The program includes the entire `bits/stdc++.h` library, which is not recommended. Instead, only include the necessary headers.

2. Use `vector.reserve()` to allocate memory: The program uses vectors to store the graph. By reserving memory in advance using `vector.reserve()`, we can avoid unnecessary memory reallocation during the program's execution.

3. Avoid unnecessary conversions and typecasting: The program converts integers to long long int and vice versa. Since the program doesn't require long long int precision, we can use int instead to save memory and reduce typecasting.

4. Use pass-by-reference: The program passes vectors and integers by value to the functions. By using pass-by-reference, we can avoid unnecessary copying of data.

5. Use range-based for loops: The program uses index-based for loops to iterate over vectors. By using range-based for loops, we can simplify the code and improve readability.

6. Remove unnecessary variables: The program uses a `temp` variable to store the minimum cost during DFS. Since it is only used within the function, we can declare it as a local variable.

Based on these optimizations, the optimized C++ program is as follows:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <stack>
using namespace std;

vector<int> v1[200010], v2[200010];
int cost[200010];
int par[200010];
bool vis[200010];
stack<int> st;

void dfs(int& source) {
    vis[source] = true;
    for (int& i : v1[source]) {
        if (!vis[i]) {
            dfs(i);
        }
    }
    st.push(source);
}

void dfs2(int& source, int& val) {
    int temp = cost[source];
    vis[source] = false;
    par[source] = val;
    for (int& i : v2[source]) {
        if (vis[i]) {
            dfs2(i, val);
        }
    }
}

int main() {
    int n;
    cin >> n;

    for (int i = 0; i < 200010; i++) {
        par[i] = i;
        v1[i].reserve(n); // Reserve memory for better performance
        v2[i].reserve(n); // Reserve memory for better performance
    }

    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        cin >> cost[i];
    }

    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        int x;
        cin >> x;
        v1[i].push_back(x);
        v2[x].push_back(i);
    }

    long long ans = 0;

    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        if (!vis[i]) {
            dfs(i);
        }
    }

    while (!st.empty()) {
        int top = st.top();
        st.pop();
        if (vis[top]) {
            int temp = cost[top];
            dfs2(top, top);
            cost[top] = temp;
            ans += temp;
        }
    }

    for (int i = 0; i < 200010; i++) {
        for (int& child : v1[i]) {
            if (par[i] != par[child]) {
                ans -= cost[par[i]];
                cost[par[i]] = 0;
            }
        }
    }

    cout << ans << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

These optimizations will improve the program's performance by reducing unnecessary operations and memory usage.
