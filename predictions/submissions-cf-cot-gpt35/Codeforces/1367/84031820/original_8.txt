Step 1: Remove unnecessary includes and typedefs.

The program includes the entire `<bits/stdc++.h>` library, which is not necessary. We can remove it and include only the necessary headers. Additionally, the typedefs `ll` and `ld` are not used in the program and can be removed.

Step 2: Remove unnecessary macros.

The macro `ceil(n, m)` is not used in the program and can be removed. The macros `all(x)` and `rall(x)` can be replaced with the corresponding function calls `begin(x)` and `rbegin(x)`.

Step 3: Optimize the loop for calculating the prefix array.

The loop that calculates the prefix array can be optimized by using a sliding window approach. Instead of updating the prefix array for every character, we can update it only for the first `k+1` characters and then update the prefix array by subtracting the value at index `i-k-1` and adding the value at index `i+k+1`. This will reduce the number of operations and improve the running time.

Step 4: Optimize the loop for counting the number of zeros.

The loop that counts the number of zeros can be optimized by merging the nested loops. We can keep track of the count of zeros (`cnt`) and the current index (`i`) in the same loop. Instead of using a separate loop to check if `cnt` is greater than 0 and increment `ans`, we can directly increment `ans` when `cnt` is greater than 0 and reset `cnt` to `-k`.

Step 5: Optimize the loop for incrementing `i`.

The loop that increments `i` can be optimized by using a while loop instead of a for loop. This will allow us to increment `i` multiple times until `pref[i]` is non-zero, instead of incrementing it only once.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);

  int t;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    int n, k, ans = 0;
    string s;
    cin >> n >> k >> s;
    vector<int> pref(n + 1);
    
    for (int i = 0; i < min(k + 1, n); ++i)
      if (s[i] == '1')
        pref[0] += 1, pref[min(n, i + k + 1)] += -1;
    
    for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i)
      pref[i] += pref[i - 1];
    
    int i = 0;
    while (i < n) {
      if (pref[i] == 0) {
        int cnt = 0;
        while (i < n && pref[i] == 0) {
          ++cnt;
          if (cnt > 0) {
            ++ans;
            cnt = -k;
          }
          ++i;
        }
      } else {
        ++i;
      }
    }
    
    cout << ans << '\n';
  }
}
```
