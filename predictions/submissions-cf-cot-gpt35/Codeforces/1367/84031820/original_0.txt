The given program calculates the number of moves required to convert a binary string into a string of all 0s. The program uses an approach where it maintains a prefix sum array to track the number of changes required at each index.

To optimize the program for running time and memory usage, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary libraries: The program includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` library, which is not required. We can remove this line.

2. Avoid using the `typedef` statements: The `typedef` statements for `long long` and `long double` are not necessary in this program. We can remove these lines.

3. Remove unnecessary macros: The `ceil` macro is not used in the program. We can remove the `#define ceil(n, m)` line.

4. Avoid using `vector` functions: The program uses `vector` functions like `begin()`, `end()`, `rbegin()`, and `rend()`. Instead of using these functions, we can directly access the elements of the vector using the index.

5. Optimize the prefix sum calculation: The prefix sum calculation can be optimized by removing the unnecessary additions and subtractions. Instead of adding 1 and subtracting 1, we can use a counter variable to keep track of the net change at each index.

6. Use a single loop for counting consecutive zeros: Instead of using nested loops, we can use a single loop to count the number of consecutive zeros. We can increment the loop variable using the count of zeros found instead of incrementing it by 1 each time.

7. Remove unnecessary checks: The condition `if (cnt > 0)` is always true in the program. We can remove this check.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);

  int t;
  cin >> t;
  
  while (t--) {
    int n, k, ans = 0;
    string s;
    cin >> n >> k >> s;
  
    vector<int> pref(n);
    int cnt = 0;
    
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
      if (s[i] == '1') {
        cnt = max(0, cnt - k);
        pref[i] += 1;
        if (i + k < n)
          pref[i + k] -= 1;
      }
    }
  
    for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i)
      pref[i] += pref[i - 1];
  
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
      if (pref[i] == 0) {
        ans++;
        cnt = -k;
        i += cnt;
      }
    }
  
    cout << ans << '\n';
  }
}
```

These modifications will help improve the running time and memory usage of the program.
