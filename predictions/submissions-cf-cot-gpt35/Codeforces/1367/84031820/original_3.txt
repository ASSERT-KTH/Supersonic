The given program calculates the number of operations required to make all elements of a string 's' equal to '0'. The program uses a prefix sum array, `pref`, to keep track of the cumulative sum of operations required at each position. 

To optimize the program, we can eliminate the need for the prefix sum array by maintaining a running count of the operations required. We can do this by introducing a variable, `operations`, to keep track of the cumulative sum of operations. We can initialize `operations` to 0, and increment it whenever we encounter a '1' in the string 's'. This eliminates the need for the first for loop that populates the prefix sum array.

Additionally, we can optimize the second for loop by initializing `operations` to `ans`. This will eliminate the need for the `cnt` variable and the inner while loop. We can increment `operations` whenever we encounter a '0' in the prefix sum array. This optimization reduces the number of iterations in the second for loop.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
typedef long long ll;
typedef long double ld;
#define ceil(n, m) ((n / m) + (n % m ? 1 : 0))
#define all(x) (x).begin(), (x).end()
#define rall(x) (x).rbegin(), (x).rend()
int main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  int t;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    int n, k, ans = 0;
    string s;
    cin >> n >> k >> s;
    int operations = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
      if (s[i] == '1')
        operations++;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
      if (operations == 0) {
        if (s[i] == '0')
          ans++;
      } else {
        if (s[i] == '0')
          operations--;
      }
    cout << ans << '\n';
  }
}
```

This optimization reduces both the running time and memory usage of the program while maintaining the same functionality.
