Step 1: Remove unnecessary header file and typedefs.

The program includes the header file `<bits/stdc++.h>`, which includes a lot of unnecessary header files. We can remove this line and include only the necessary header files. Additionally, the typedefs `ll` and `ld` are not used in the program, so we can remove them as well.

Step 2: Remove unnecessary macros.

The program defines two macros `ceil` and `all`, but they are not used in the program. We can remove these macro definitions.

Step 3: Optimize the prefix sum calculation.

The program uses a prefix sum technique to calculate the number of ones in a sliding window of size 2k+1. However, the current implementation updates the prefix sum array twice for each one encountered. We can optimize this by updating the prefix sum array only once for each one encountered. This can be done by incrementing the value at the left boundary of the window and decrementing the value at the right boundary of the window.

Step 4: Optimize the counting of consecutive zeros.

The program uses a loop to count the number of consecutive zeros in the prefix sum array. However, the current implementation has unnecessary checks and increments. We can optimize this by using a single loop to count the number of zeros and increment the answer only when a sequence of zeros ends.

Step 5: Remove unnecessary checks in the counting loop.

The counting loop checks if `cnt > 0` before incrementing the answer and resetting `cnt`. However, `cnt` is always non-negative at this point, so the check is unnecessary. We can remove this check to further optimize the loop.

Step 6: Optimize the loop for counting the number of zeros.

The counting loop uses a while loop to count the number of zeros in the prefix sum array. However, we can optimize this by using a for loop instead. This will simplify the loop logic and remove the unnecessary increment of `i` inside the loop.

Step 7: Remove unnecessary variable initialization.

The variable `cnt` is initialized to 0 before the counting loop, but it is immediately incremented inside the loop. We can remove the initialization of `cnt` and directly initialize it to `-k` inside the loop.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  int t;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    int n, k, ans = 0;
    string s;
    cin >> n >> k >> s;
    vector<int> pref(n + 1);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
      if (s[i] == '1') {
        int left = max(0, i - k);
        int right = min(n, i + k + 1);
        pref[left] += 1;
        pref[right] -= 1;
      }
    }
    for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
      pref[i] += pref[i - 1];
    }
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
      if (pref[i] == 0) {
        int cnt = -k;
        for (; i < n && pref[i] == 0; ++i) {
          ++cnt;
          if (cnt == 0) {
            ++ans;
            cnt = -k;
          }
        }
      }
    }
    cout << ans << '\n';
  }
}
```
