This program calculates the number of times the string can be modified by flipping k consecutive characters to '0' such that the resulting string does not have any consecutive '1's.

To optimize this program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary header files: The program includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header file, which includes all standard library header files. We can remove this line and include only the necessary header files.

2. Remove unnecessary type definitions: The program defines `ll` and `ld` types, but they are not used. We can remove these type definitions.

3. Replace the ceil macro with a function: The ceil macro is used to calculate the ceiling of the division of two numbers. We can replace it with a function to improve readability.

4. Avoid using `std::endl`: The program uses `std::endl` to output a newline character and flush the output stream. However, using `std::endl` flushes the stream every time it is called, which can significantly reduce performance. We can replace it with the newline character `'\n'` to improve performance.

5. Optimize the loop for calculating the prefix array: The loop that calculates the prefix array can be optimized by using prefix sum instead of individual additions and subtractions. This can be achieved by initializing `pref[0]` to 0 before the loop and updating `pref[i]` as `pref[i] = pref[i-1] + pref[i]`.

6. Optimize the loop for counting consecutive zeros: The loop that counts consecutive zeros can be optimized by using a variable `cnt` to keep track of the number of consecutive zeros. We can increment `cnt` when encountering a zero and check if `cnt` exceeds `k`. If it does, we increment `ans` and reset `cnt` to `-k`. We can also remove the unnecessary check `if (cnt > 0)`.

Here is the optimized C++ program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int ceil_div(int n, int m) {
  return (n / m) + (n % m ? 1 : 0);
}

int main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  
  int t;
  cin >> t;
  
  while (t--) {
    int n, k, ans = 0;
    string s;
    cin >> n >> k >> s;
    
    vector<int> pref(n + 1);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
      if (s[i] == '1') {
        pref[max(0, i - k)] += 1;
        pref[min(n, i + k + 1)] += -1;
      }
    }
    
    for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
      pref[i] += pref[i - 1];
    }
    
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
      if (pref[i] == 0) {
        int cnt = 0;
        while (i < n && pref[i] == 0) {
          ++cnt;
          if (cnt > k) {
            ++ans;
            cnt = -k;
          }
          ++i;
        }
      }
    }
    
    cout << ans << '\n';
  }
  
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized program reduces the usage of unnecessary libraries, improves the calculation of the prefix array, and optimizes the loop for counting consecutive zeros. These optimizations should improve the running time and memory usage of the program.
