Step 1: Remove unnecessary include statements
- The `bits/stdc++.h` header includes a large number of other headers, which can increase compile time and memory usage. It's better to include only the necessary headers.

Step 2: Remove unnecessary macros
- The macros `pb` and `ll` are not used in the program. They can be removed.

Step 3: Optimize input/output operations
- The code uses `cin` and `cout` for input and output operations. These operations can be slow for large inputs. To optimize the input/output, we can use `scanf` and `printf` instead.

Step 4: Optimize the algorithm
- The current algorithm has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of elements in the input. We can optimize the algorithm by finding the maximum attack value and its corresponding index in a single pass, instead of two passes. This will reduce the number of operations and improve the running time.

Here is the optimized C++ program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

void solve() {
  int a, b, n;
  int res = 0;
  scanf("%d %d %d", &a, &b, &n);
  
  int maxAttack = 0, maxAttackIndex;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    int attack;
    scanf("%d", &attack);
    if (attack > maxAttack) {
      maxAttack = attack;
      maxAttackIndex = i;
    }
  }

  int health[n];
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    scanf("%d", &health[i]);

  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    if (i == maxAttackIndex)
      continue;
    int d = (health[i] + a - 1) / a;
    d = d * maxAttack;
    res += d;
  }

  if (res >= b) {
    printf("NO\n");
    return;
  }

  b = b - res;
  int x = (b + maxAttack - 1) / maxAttack;
  int y = (health[maxAttackIndex] + a - 1) / a;

  if (x >= y)
    printf("YES\n");
  else
    printf("NO\n");
}

int main() {
  int tt;
  scanf("%d", &tt);
  while (tt--)
    solve();

  return 0;
}
```

The optimized program makes the following changes:
- Removes unnecessary include statements.
- Removes unnecessary macros.
- Replaces `cin` and `cout` with `scanf` and `printf` for input/output operations.
- Optimizes the algorithm to find the maximum attack value and its index in a single pass.
