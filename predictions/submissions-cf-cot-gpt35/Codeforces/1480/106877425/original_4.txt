Step 1: Remove unnecessary includes

The `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` includes a lot of unnecessary headers. We only need the `<iostream>` header for input/output operations.

Step 2: Remove unnecessary macros

The `pb` macro is unnecessary and can be removed.

Step 3: Optimize the loop for finding maximum attack value

Currently, the program iterates over all the attacks to find the maximum attack value. We can optimize this by keeping track of the maximum attack value and its index while reading the input. This will eliminate the need for a separate loop to find the maximum attack value.

Step 4: Optimize the loop for calculating the result

The current loop calculates the damage for each enemy, but it also includes the enemy with the maximum attack value. We can skip the calculation for the enemy with the maximum attack value and calculate the damage for the remaining enemies in a single loop.

Step 5: Simplify the condition in the final check

The condition `x >= y` in the final check can be simplified to `b >= health[k] * a - attack[k]`. This eliminates the need for calculating `x` and `y`.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

void solve() {
  long long a, b, n;
  long long res = 0;
  cin >> a >> b >> n;
  long long attack[n], health[n];
  int k = 0;
  long long mm = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> attack[i];
    if (mm < attack[i]) {
      k = i;
      mm = attack[i];
    }
  }
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    cin >> health[i];
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    if (i == k)
      continue;
    long long d = (health[i] + a - 1) / a;
    d = d * attack[i];
    res += d;
  }
  if (res >= b) {
    cout << "NO" << "\n";
    return;
  }
  b = b - res;
  if (b >= health[k] * a - attack[k])
    cout << "YES" << "\n";
  else
    cout << "NO" << "\n";
}

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(0);
  int tt = 1;
  cin >> tt;
  while (tt--)
    solve();
}
```
