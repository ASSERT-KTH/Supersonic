Optimization steps:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The program includes `<bits/stdc++.h>`, which includes a large number of standard library headers. This can lead to slower compilation times and increased memory usage. Instead, include only the necessary headers for the program.

2. Remove unnecessary macros: The program defines macros for `pb` and `ll`, but they are not used in the code. Remove these macros to simplify the code.

3. Avoid unnecessary array initialization: The program initializes the `attack` and `health` arrays with size `n`, but does not use the entire arrays. Instead, initialize the arrays with the actual number of elements needed.

4. Optimize the loop to find the maximum attack value: The program uses a loop to find the maximum attack value and its index. Instead of using a separate variable `mm` to keep track of the maximum value, we can directly compare and update the maximum value while reading the input. This eliminates the need for the separate loop.

5. Optimize the loops for calculating the result: The program uses three separate loops to calculate the result. We can combine these loops into a single loop to avoid unnecessary iterations.

6. Avoid unnecessary calculations: The program calculates `d = (health[i] + a - 1) / a` and then multiplies it by `attack[i]`. Instead, we can calculate `d = (health[i] + a - 1) / a * attack[i]` directly.

7. Optimize the final condition: The program checks if `res >= b` and then subtracts `res` from `b`. Instead, we can check if `(b - res) >= 0` directly.

8. Avoid unnecessary variables: The program uses variables `x` and `y` to calculate the final result. Instead, we can directly compare `(b + attack[k] - 1) / attack[k]` with `(health[k] + a - 1) / a`.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

void solve() {
  int a, b, n;
  int res = 0;
  cin >> a >> b >> n;

  int maxAttack = 0, maxAttackIndex = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    int attack;
    cin >> attack;
    if (attack > maxAttack) {
      maxAttack = attack;
      maxAttackIndex = i;
    }
  }

  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    int health;
    cin >> health;
    if (i != maxAttackIndex) {
      int d = (health + a - 1) / a * attack;
      res += d;
    }
  }

  if ((b - res) >= 0) {
    cout << "YES" << "\n";
  } else {
    cout << "NO" << "\n";
  }
}

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(0);

  int tt = 1;
  cin >> tt;
  while (tt--)
    solve();
}
```
