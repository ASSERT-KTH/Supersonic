Optimization:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The program includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header file, which includes a large number of standard library headers. This can slow down compilation time and increase memory usage. Since the program does not use any specific standard library features, we can remove this include statement.

2. Avoid unnecessary variable declarations: The program declares variables `ll a, b, n;` before reading their values from input. We can directly read the values into these variables instead of declaring them separately.

3. Avoid unnecessary array declarations: The program declares arrays `attack[n]` and `health[n]` to store attack and health values. However, we can avoid declaring these arrays and directly process the input values in the loop.

4. Combine loop conditions: The program has three separate loops to read attack values, health values, and calculate the result. We can combine these loops into a single loop to avoid unnecessary iterations.

5. Use more meaningful variable names: The variables `k` and `mm` are not very descriptive. We can rename them to `maxAttackIndex` and `maxAttackValue` respectively to improve code readability.

6. Avoid unnecessary division and multiplication: In the calculation of `d`, the program divides `health[i]` by `a` and then multiplies it by `attack[i]`. We can combine these operations into a single step by multiplying `health[i]` by `attack[i]` and then dividing it by `a`.

7. Combine the condition checks: The condition `if (res >= b)` can be combined with the assignment statement `b = b - res` to avoid an extra comparison.

8. Use more descriptive variable names: The variables `x` and `y` are not very descriptive. We can rename them to `requiredAttacks` and `requiredHealth` respectively to improve code readability.

9. Avoid unnecessary input/output operations: The program uses `cout` to output the result multiple times. We can store the result in a variable and print it at the end to avoid multiple output operations.

10. Remove unnecessary return statement: The `main` function has a `return` statement at the end, but it is not necessary as the program will automatically return 0 at the end of `main`.

Here is the optimized program:

```c++
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

#define ll long long

void solve() {
  ll a, b, n;
  cin >> a >> b >> n;

  ll maxAttackValue = 0;
  int maxAttackIndex = 0;
  ll res = 0;

  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    ll attack, health;
    cin >> attack;
    if (maxAttackValue < attack) {
      maxAttackIndex = i;
      maxAttackValue = attack;
    }
    cin >> health;
    if (i != maxAttackIndex) {
      ll d = (health * attack + a - 1) / a;
      res += d;
    }
  }

  b = b - res;
  ll requiredAttacks = (b + maxAttackValue - 1) / maxAttackValue;
  ll requiredHealth = (health[maxAttackIndex] + a - 1) / a;

  if (requiredAttacks >= requiredHealth)
    cout << "YES\n";
  else
    cout << "NO\n";
}

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(0);

  int tt;
  cin >> tt;
  while (tt--) {
    solve();
  }
}
```
