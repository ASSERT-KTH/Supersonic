The given program can be optimized in the following steps:

1. Remove unnecessary header file inclusion: The program includes `<bits/stdc++.h>` which is not necessary for this program. We can remove it.

2. Remove unnecessary macros: The program defines macros `pb` and `ll` which are not used. We can remove them.

3. Use `int` instead of `ll` for loop counters: The loop counters `i` and `k` can be of type `int` instead of `ll` as the loop indices do not exceed the range of `int`.

4. Combine the two loops for inputting `attack` and `health` arrays: Instead of separate loops for inputting `attack` and `health` arrays, we can combine them into a single loop.

5. Use prefix increment operator: Instead of using `d = d * attack[i]`, we can use `d *= attack[i]` for calculation.

6. Optimize the calculation of `x` and `y`: We can optimize the calculation of `x` and `y` by calculating `x = (b + attack[k] - 1) / attack[k]` and `y = (health[k] + a - 1) / a` in a single line.

7. Avoid unnecessary subtraction: Instead of `b = b - res`, we can use `b -= res` to avoid unnecessary subtraction.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

void solve() {
  int a, b, n;
  int res = 0;
  cin >> a >> b >> n;
  int attack[n], health[n];
  int k = 0, mm = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> attack[i];
    if (mm < attack[i]) {
      k = i;
      mm = attack[i];
    }
    cin >> health[i];
  }
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    if (i == k)
      continue;
    int d = (health[i] + a - 1) / a;
    d *= attack[i];
    res += d;
  }
  if (res >= b) {
    cout << "NO\n";
    return;
  }
  b -= res;
  int x = (b + attack[k] - 1) / attack[k];
  int y = (health[k] + a - 1) / a;
  cout << (x >= y ? "YES" : "NO") << "\n";
}

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(0);
  int tt = 1;
  cin >> tt;
  while (tt--)
    solve();
}
```
