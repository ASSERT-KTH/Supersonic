To optimize the given program, we can make the following changes:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The program includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header, which includes every standard library header. This can lead to longer compilation times. We can remove this line since it is not necessary for the program.

2. Remove unnecessary defines: The program defines `pb` and `ll`, but they are not used in the code. We can remove these lines.

3. Remove unnecessary variable: The variable `k` is used to keep track of the index with the maximum attack value. However, we don't need to store the index, we only need the maximum attack value. We can remove the `k` variable and modify the code accordingly.

4. Optimize loop iterations: In the first loop, we find the maximum attack value and its index. However, we can optimize this loop by directly calculating the maximum attack value and its index while reading the input. This will save an extra loop iteration.

5. Optimize loop calculations: In the last loop, we calculate `d` for each element and then multiply it with the corresponding attack value. Instead, we can directly calculate `d * attack[i]` in a single step. This will save unnecessary intermediate calculations.

6. Optimize conditionals: In the final conditional statement, we can simplify the logic by checking if `x >= y` instead of `x >= y` and `x > y`. This is because if `x` is equal to `y`, the player can defeat the opponent.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

void solve() {
  int a, b, n;
  int res = 0;
  cin >> a >> b >> n;
  int maxAttack = 0, maxAttackIndex = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    int attack;
    cin >> attack;
    if (attack > maxAttack) {
      maxAttack = attack;
      maxAttackIndex = i;
    }
  }
  int health[n];
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> health[i];
  }
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    if (i == maxAttackIndex)
      continue;
    int d = (health[i] + a - 1) / a;
    res += d * maxAttack;
  }
  if (res >= b) {
    cout << "NO" << "\n";
    return;
  }
  b = b - res;
  int x = (b + maxAttack - 1) / maxAttack;
  int y = (health[maxAttackIndex] + a - 1) / a;
  if (x >= y) {
    cout << "YES" << "\n";
  } else {
    cout << "NO" << "\n";
  }
}

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(0);
  int tt = 1;
  cin >> tt;
  while (tt--)
    solve();
}
```

These optimizations should improve the running time and memory usage of the program.
