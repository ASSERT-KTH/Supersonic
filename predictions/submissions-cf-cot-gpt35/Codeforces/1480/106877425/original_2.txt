Step 1: Remove unnecessary header file inclusion.

The `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` is a non-standard header file that includes many standard library headers. It is not recommended to use this header file as it increases compilation time and may include unnecessary headers. In this program, only the `<iostream>` header is required, so we can remove the unnecessary inclusion.

Step 2: Remove unnecessary macro definitions.

The `pb` and `ll` macro definitions are not used in the program. We can remove them.

Step 3: Optimize the loop for finding the maximum attack value.

Currently, the program uses a loop to find the maximum attack value and its corresponding index. We can optimize this loop by using a variable to keep track of the maximum attack value and its index while reading the input. This way, we can eliminate the need for a separate loop to find the maximum.

Step 4: Optimize the loop for calculating the total damage.

The current loop for calculating the total damage can be optimized by directly calculating the damage without storing it in an array. We can eliminate the need for the `attack` array and directly calculate the damage for each enemy.

Step 5: Optimize the calculation of `x` and `y`.

The calculation of `x` and `y` can be simplified by using integer division instead of the current expression. This will remove the need for modulo operations.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

void solve() {
  int a, b, n;
  int res = 0;
  cin >> a >> b >> n;
  int maxAttack = 0, maxAttackIndex = -1;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    int attack;
    cin >> attack;
    if (attack > maxAttack) {
      maxAttack = attack;
      maxAttackIndex = i;
    }
  }
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    int health;
    cin >> health;
    if (i != maxAttackIndex) {
      int damage = (health + a - 1) / a * maxAttack;
      res += damage;
    }
  }
  if (res >= b) {
    cout << "NO" << "\n";
    return;
  }
  b -= res;
  int x = (b + maxAttack - 1) / maxAttack;
  int y = (health[maxAttackIndex] + a - 1) / a;
  if (x >= y)
    cout << "YES" << "\n";
  else
    cout << "NO" << "\n";
}

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(0);
  int tt;
  cin >> tt;
  while (tt--)
    solve();
}
```
