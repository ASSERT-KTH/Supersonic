The given program calculates the minimum cost required to make two arrays equal. The optimization steps are as follows:

1. Remove unnecessary header files: The program includes `<bits/stdc++.h>`, which is a non-standard header file and includes a large number of other header files. This can slow down the compilation time and increase memory usage. Instead, only include the necessary header files such as `<iostream>` and `<algorithm>`.

2. Remove unnecessary macros: The program defines macros for loop iterations (`rep`, `for1`, `FOR`, `FORD`). These macros are not necessary and can be replaced with regular for loops. This will improve code readability.

3. Remove unused functions: The program defines functions `isPowerOfTwo` and `binpow`, but these functions are not used in the program. Remove these unused functions to reduce memory usage.

4. Use `vector` instead of arrays: The program uses C-style arrays (`a` and `b`) to store the input values. Instead, use `vector` containers, which dynamically allocate memory and provide additional functionality. This will simplify the code and improve memory usage.

5. Remove unnecessary calculations: The program calculates the minimum elements of arrays `a` and `b` using `min_element` function twice. Instead, calculate these values only once and store them in variables (`ma` and `mo`).

6. Simplify the calculation of `ans`: The calculation of `ans` can be simplified by separating the cases into three conditions: when both `a[i]` and `b[i]` are greater than `ma` and `mo`, when only `a[i]` is greater than `ma`, and when only `b[i]` is greater than `mo`. This eliminates the need for nested if-else statements.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

void fastio() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(0);
  cout.tie(0);
}

int main() {
  fastio();
  int tc = 1;
  cin >> tc;
  while (tc--) {
    int n;
    cin >> n;
    vector<long long> a(n), b(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) cin >> a[i];
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) cin >> b[i];
    long long ma = *min_element(a.begin(), a.end()), mo = *min_element(b.begin(), b.end());
    long long ans = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      if (a[i] > ma && b[i] > mo) {
        int x = min(a[i] - ma, b[i] - mo);
        a[i] -= x;
        b[i] -= x;
        ans += x;
      }
      if (a[i] > ma)
        ans += a[i] - ma;
      if (b[i] > mo)
        ans += b[i] - mo;
    }
    cout << ans << "\n";
  }
  return 0;
}
```

By making these optimizations, the program will have improved running time and reduced memory usage.
