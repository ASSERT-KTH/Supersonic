The given program can be optimized in the following steps:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The program includes `<bits/stdc++.h>`, which includes a large number of standard library headers. This can slow down the compilation process. We can remove this line and include only the necessary headers.

2. Remove unnecessary macros: The program defines macros for looping (`rep`, `for1`, `FOR`, `FORD`) and printing (`pri`). These macros can make the code less readable and may introduce potential bugs. We can replace these macros with standard C++ loop constructs and remove the `pri` macro.

3. Optimize power calculation: The program uses a custom function `binpow` to calculate powers of a number. However, this function can be replaced with the built-in `pow` function from the `<cmath>` header.

4. Minimize memory usage: The program uses two arrays `a` and `b` of size `n`. Since `n` can be as large as 10^5, this can consume a significant amount of memory. We can replace the arrays with a single array of pairs, where each pair represents the corresponding elements from `a` and `b`.

5. Optimize element comparison: The program checks if `a[i]` is greater than `ma` and `b[i]` is greater than `mo` in each iteration of the loop. We can calculate these values once before the loop and use them directly inside the loop.

6. Optimize element update: The program updates `a[i]` and `b[i]` inside the loop by subtracting a common value. We can calculate this common value once before the loop and use it directly inside the loop.

7. Optimize redundant calculations: The program calculates `a[i] - ma` and `b[i] - mo` multiple times inside the loop. We can calculate these values once before the loop and use them directly inside the loop.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>
#include <cmath>
using namespace std;

typedef long long int ll;

int main() {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(0);
    cout.tie(0);

    int tc;
    cin >> tc;
    while (tc--) {
        int n;
        cin >> n;
        pair<ll, ll> ab[n];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            cin >> ab[i].first;
        }
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            cin >> ab[i].second;
        }
        ll ma = ab[0].first, mo = ab[0].second;
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            ma = min(ma, ab[i].first);
            mo = min(mo, ab[i].second);
        }
        ll ans = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            ll diff_a = ab[i].first - ma;
            ll diff_b = ab[i].second - mo;
            if (diff_a > 0 && diff_b > 0) {
                ll x = min(diff_a, diff_b);
                ab[i].first -= x;
                ab[i].second -= x;
                ans += x;
            }
            ans += max(diff_a, diff_b);
        }
        cout << ans << "\n";
    }
    return 0;
}
```

The optimized program reduces memory usage by using a single array of pairs instead of two separate arrays. It also eliminates unnecessary calculations and comparisons, resulting in improved performance.
