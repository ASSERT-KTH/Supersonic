To optimize the given program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary header files: The program includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header file, which is not a standard C++ header file and can slow down the compilation process. We can remove this header file and include only the necessary standard C++ header files.

2. Remove unnecessary macros: The program defines macros for looping, which can be replaced with standard for-loops. We can replace the `rep(i, n)` and `for1(i, n)` macros with a standard for-loop starting from 0 and going up to n-1. Similarly, we can replace the `FOR(i, a, b)` and `FORD(i, a, b)` macros with standard for-loops.

3. Remove unnecessary functions: The program defines a function `isPowerOfTwo()` which is not used anywhere. We can remove this function to improve the code clarity.

4. Avoid unnecessary calculations: In the main loop, the program checks if both `a[i]` and `b[i]` are greater than `ma` and `mo` respectively. If they are, it calculates the minimum difference and subtracts it from both `a[i]` and `b[i]`. However, this check is unnecessary because if `a[i]` is greater than `ma`, then `b[i]` will always be greater than `mo` due to the ordering of the arrays. We can remove this check to avoid unnecessary calculations.

5. Avoid repeated calculations: In the main loop, the program calculates `a[i] - ma` and `b[i] - mo` multiple times. We can calculate these values once and store them in variables to avoid repeated calculations.

After making these optimizations, the optimized code will look like this:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

typedef long long int ll;

int main() {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(0);
    cout.tie(0);

    int tc;
    cin >> tc;
    while (tc--) {
        int n;
        cin >> n;
        ll a[n], b[n];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            cin >> a[i];
        }
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            cin >> b[i];
        }

        ll ma = *min_element(a, a + n);
        ll mo = *min_element(b, b + n);
        ll ans = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            ll diff_a = a[i] - ma;
            ll diff_b = b[i] - mo;

            ans += max(diff_a, diff_b);
        }

        cout << ans << '\n';
    }

    return 0;
}
```

This optimized code will have better performance in terms of running time and memory usage compared to the original code.
