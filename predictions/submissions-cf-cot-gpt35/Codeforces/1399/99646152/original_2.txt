Step 1: Remove unnecessary includes
The program includes the entire `<bits/stdc++.h>` header, which is not necessary and can slow down the compilation process. We can remove this include statement.

Step 2: Remove unnecessary macros
The program defines macros for looping (`rep`, `for1`, `FOR`, `FORD`). These macros are not used in the program and can be removed.

Step 3: Use a more efficient algorithm for finding the minimum elements
The program uses `min_element` to find the minimum elements of arrays `a` and `b`. However, this function has a time complexity of O(n). We can optimize this by finding the minimum elements in a single iteration using a simple loop.

Step 4: Combine the two loops for inputting arrays `a` and `b`
The program currently has two separate loops for inputting arrays `a` and `b`. We can combine these loops into a single loop to reduce the number of iterations.

Step 5: Optimize the calculation of `ans`
The calculation of `ans` can be optimized by removing redundant conditions. We can calculate `x` as the minimum of `a[i] - ma` and `b[i] - mo` and subtract `x` from both `a[i]` and `b[i]`. Then, we can directly add `x` to `ans`. Finally, we can calculate the additional contribution to `ans` based on the remaining values of `a[i]` and `b[i]`.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#pragma GCC optimize("O2")
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

void fastio() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(0);
  cout.tie(0);
}

int main() {
  fastio();
  int tc = 1;
  cin >> tc;
  while (tc--) {
    int n;
    cin >> n;
    long long a[n], b[n];
    long long ma = INT_MAX, mo = INT_MAX;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      cin >> a[i];
      ma = min(ma, a[i]);
    }
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      cin >> b[i];
      mo = min(mo, b[i]);
    }
    long long ans = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      long long x = min(a[i] - ma, b[i] - mo);
      a[i] -= x;
      b[i] -= x;
      ans += x;
      ans += max(a[i] - ma, b[i] - mo);
    }
    cout << ans << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```
