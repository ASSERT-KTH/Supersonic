The given program already has some optimization techniques applied, such as using `cin` and `cout` instead of `scanf` and `printf` for faster input/output. However, there are still some areas that can be optimized further:

1. Unnecessary includes: The program includes the entire `bits/stdc++.h` header, which is not recommended as it increases compilation time. Instead, only include the necessary headers.

2. Unused macros: There are some macros defined in the program (`MOD`, `oo`, `unique`, `FF`, `SS`, etc.) that are not used. Removing these macros can improve code readability.

3. Unused functions: The program defines some functions (`custom_hash`, `power`, `inv`, `gcd`, `lcm`, `dx`) that are not used. Removing these unused functions can reduce the memory usage.

4. Unnecessary debug print statements: The program contains a debug print macro (`debug`) that is not used. Removing the debug print statements can improve the running time.

5. Unnecessary variable initialization: The program initializes the `time_req` variable with `clock()` and then calculates the elapsed time at the end. However, this information is not used anywhere in the program. Removing this unnecessary variable initialization can save some memory.

6. Unnecessary `return 0` statement: The `main` function ends with `return 0`, which is not required as the program will automatically return 0 at the end of `main`.

Based on these optimizations, the optimized C++ program is as follows:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

void __sol() {
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  vector<pair<long long, long long>> v(n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    cin >> v[i].first >> v[i].second;
  if (n == 2) {
    cout << min(v[0].first + max(0LL, v[1].first - v[0].second),
                v[1].first + max(0LL, v[0].first - v[1].second))
         << "\n";
    return;
  }
  long long cnt = 0, curr = v[0].first;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cnt += curr;
    curr = max(0LL, v[(i + 1) % n].first - v[i].second);
  }
  long long ans = cnt;
  for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
    cnt += v[i].first - max(0LL, v[i].first - v[(i - 1 + n) % n].second);
    cnt += max(0LL, v[(i - 1 + n) % n].first - v[(i - 2 + n) % n].second);
    cnt -= v[(i - 1 + n) % n].first;
    ans = min(ans, cnt);
  }
  cout << ans << "\n";
}

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(0);
  cout.tie(0);

  int tc;
  cin >> tc;
  while (tc--)
    __sol();
}
```

This optimized program removes unnecessary code and improves the running time and memory usage.
