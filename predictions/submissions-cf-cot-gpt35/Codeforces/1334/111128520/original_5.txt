The given program is a solution to a problem that involves some calculations and iterations. To optimize the program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary header files: The program includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header file, which is not recommended as it includes a large number of unnecessary header files. We can remove it and include only the necessary header files.

2. Remove unused macros: The program defines several macros (`ll`, `MOD`, `oo`, `forr`, `fastio`, `all`, `unique`, `eb`, `FF`, `SS`, `mem`, `pb`, `popcount`) that are not used in the program. We can remove them to simplify the code.

3. Remove debug printing functions: The program includes several debug printing functions (`__print`, `_print`, `debug`) that are not used in the final version of the program. We can remove them to improve the program's efficiency.

4. Remove custom hash struct: The program defines a custom hash struct (`custom_hash`) that is not used in the program. We can remove it to simplify the code.

5. Remove power and inverse functions: The program defines two power functions (`power`) and an inverse function (`inv`) that are not used in the program. We can remove them to simplify the code.

6. Remove gcd and lcm functions: The program defines two functions (`gcd`, `lcm`) that are not used in the program. We can remove them to simplify the code.

7. Use `const` reference in vector input operator: The program defines an input operator for vectors (`operator>>`) that takes the vector by value. We can modify it to take the vector by `const` reference to avoid unnecessary copying.

8. Simplify the solution function: The `__sol` function has multiple nested loops and complex calculations. We can simplify it by refactoring the code and using more descriptive variable names.

After applying these optimizations, the optimized program is as follows:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

void solve() {
    int n;
    cin >> n;
    
    vector<pair<long long, long long>> v(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        cin >> v[i].first >> v[i].second;
    }
    
    if (n == 2) {
        long long ans = min(v[0].first + max(0LL, v[1].first - v[0].second),
                            v[1].first + max(0LL, v[0].first - v[1].second));
        cout << ans << "\n";
        return;
    }
    
    long long cnt = 0, curr = v[0].first;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        cnt += curr;
        curr = max(0LL, v[(i + 1) % n].first - v[i].second);
    }
    
    long long ans = cnt;
    for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
        cnt += v[i].first - max(0LL, v[i].first - v[(i - 1 + n) % n].second);
        cnt += max(0LL, v[(i - 1 + n) % n].first - v[(i - 2 + n) % n].second);
        cnt -= v[(i - 1 + n) % n].first;
        ans = min(ans, cnt);
    }
    
    cout << ans << "\n";
}

int main() {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(0);
    cout.tie(0);
    
    int tc;
    cin >> tc;
    
    while (tc--) {
        solve();
    }
    
    return 0;
}
```

This optimized program simplifies the code by removing unnecessary macros, functions, and debug printing statements. It also improves the readability of the code by using more descriptive variable names in the solution function.
