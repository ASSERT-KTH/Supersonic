The given program has a few areas that can be optimized:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The program includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header, which includes a lot of unnecessary headers. We can remove this and include only the necessary headers - `<iostream>`, `<vector>`, `<algorithm>`, and `<limits>`.

2. Remove unused macros: The program defines several macros that are not used. We can remove them to simplify the code.

3. Avoid using `using namespace std;`: It is generally not recommended to use `using namespace std;` as it can cause name clashes. Instead, we can use the `std::` prefix for the standard library functions and types.

4. Avoid using global variables: The program uses global variables for `t`, `nn`, `m`, and `n`. We can move these variable declarations to within the `main()` function to localize their scope.

5. Avoid unnecessary vector copying: The program copies the elements from the input into a vector `v`. Instead, we can directly read the elements into the vector.

6. Avoid unnecessary sorting: The program sorts the vector in descending order using `sort(v.rbegin(), v.rend())`. Since we are only interested in the maximum element, we can find it without sorting the entire vector.

7. Use a more efficient average calculation: The program calculates the average using a loop and dividing by the number of elements. Instead, we can calculate the cumulative sum and divide by the number of elements in a single step.

8. Avoid unnecessary floating-point operations: The program uses a `long double` array `arr` to store the averages. Since we are only interested in comparing the averages with an integer `m`, we can use integer operations instead of floating-point operations.

9. Avoid unnecessary type conversions: The program converts the average to a `long double` and then compares it with `m`. We can compare the average directly with `m` without the need for type conversion.

10. Optimize the loop length: The loop `for (int i = 0; i < v.size(); i++)` iterates over all elements of the vector. Since we are only interested in the averages that are greater than or equal to `m`, we can terminate the loop early if we encounter an average that is less than `m`.

Here is the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <limits>

int main() {
  std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0);
  std::cin.tie(0);

  int t;
  std::cin >> t;

  while (t--) {
    int nn, m;
    std::cin >> nn >> m;

    std::vector<int> v(nn);
    for (int i = 0; i < nn; i++) {
      std::cin >> v[i];
    }

    int cnt = 0;
    int sm = 0;
    int mx = std::numeric_limits<int>::min();

    for (int i = 0; i < nn; i++) {
      sm += v[i];
      int avg = sm / (i + 1);
      if (avg >= m) {
        cnt++;
      }
      if (avg < m) {
        break;
      }
      mx = std::max(mx, avg);
    }

    std::cout << cnt << std::endl;
  }

  return 0;
}
```

Explanation of optimizations:

1. Removed unnecessary includes.
2. Removed unused macros.
3. Avoided using `using namespace std;`.
4. Moved variable declarations to localize their scope.
5. Read the elements directly into the vector.
6. Removed unnecessary sorting.
7. Used a more efficient average calculation.
8. Used integer operations instead of floating-point operations.
9. Avoided unnecessary type conversions.
10. Terminated the loop early if an average less than `m` is encountered.
