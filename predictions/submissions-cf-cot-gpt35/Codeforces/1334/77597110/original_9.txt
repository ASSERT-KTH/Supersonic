To optimize the given program, we can make the following changes:

1. Remove unnecessary header files: The program includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header file which includes all the standard library headers. This can lead to unnecessary compilation time and memory usage. We can remove this line and include only the necessary headers.

2. Avoid using macros: The program uses macros to define constants and shortcuts. Macros can lead to unexpected behavior and are generally not recommended in modern C++. We can replace the macros with constants and inline functions.

3. Avoid using `using namespace std`: The program uses the `using namespace std` directive which can lead to naming conflicts. It is better to use the `std::` prefix to explicitly specify the namespace for standard library functions and types.

4. Avoid unnecessary variable initialization: The variables `cnt`, `it`, `z`, and `Mx` are initialized but not used in the program. We can remove these unnecessary initializations.

5. Avoid unnecessary type conversions: The program uses a `long double` array to store the average values. Since the values are integers, we can use a `double` array instead to avoid unnecessary type conversions.

6. Avoid unnecessary vector operations: The program uses a vector to store the input values and then sorts it in descending order. We can avoid using a vector and directly process the input values.

7. Use a more efficient loop: The program uses a range-based for loop to iterate over the values. However, using an index-based loop will be more efficient for this case.

Based on these optimizations, the optimized program is as follows:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>
#include <vector>

int main() {
  std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  std::cin.tie(nullptr);
  
  int t;
  std::cin >> t;
  
  while (t--) {
    int nn, m;
    std::cin >> nn >> m;
    
    double sm = 0;
    int cnt = 0;
    double arr[nn];
    
    for (int i = 0; i < nn; i++) {
      int n;
      std::cin >> n;
      
      sm += n;
      if (i == 0)
        arr[0] = n;
      else {
        arr[i] = sm / (i + 1);
      }
      if (arr[i] >= m)
        cnt++;
    }
    
    std::cout << cnt << '\n';
  }
  
  return 0;
}
```

These optimizations should improve the running time and memory usage of the program.
