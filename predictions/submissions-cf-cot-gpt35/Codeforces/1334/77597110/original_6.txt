Step 1: Remove unnecessary includes and macros

The program includes `<bits/stdc++.h>` which is a non-standard header and is not necessary. We can remove it.

The macros `ll`, `ld`, `E`, `ull`, `TeFa`, `in`, and `Mod` are not used in the program. We can remove them.

Step 2: Avoid using `using namespace std;`

Using `using namespace std;` is generally considered bad practice because it pollutes the global namespace. Instead, we can prefix the standard library types and functions with `std::`.

Step 3: Optimize input/output operations

The program is using `cin` and `cout` for input/output operations. These operations can be slow, especially when dealing with large amounts of data.

We can optimize the input/output operations by using `scanf` and `printf` from the C standard library. These functions are generally faster than `cin` and `cout`.

Step 4: Avoid unnecessary vector copying

The program is reading input values into a `vector` and then sorting the vector. This creates unnecessary overhead due to the copying of the vector elements.

We can avoid this overhead by sorting the input values directly, without using a vector.

Step 5: Optimize the loop

The loop that calculates the average values can be optimized.

Instead of calculating the sum of the values in each iteration of the loop, we can calculate the sum incrementally as we iterate through the values.

This will avoid unnecessary calculations and improve the performance of the loop.

Step 6: Optimize the sorting

The program is using `sort` to sort the input values in descending order. However, we can achieve the same result by using `partial_sort` which is faster for large containers.

Step 7: Remove unnecessary variables

The variables `cnt`, `it`, `z`, and `Mx` are not used in the program. We can remove them.

Step 8: Optimize the division operation

The division operation in the loop that calculates the average values can be slow, especially when dealing with large numbers.

We can optimize the division operation by using multiplication instead. Instead of dividing by `(i + 1)`, we can multiply by the reciprocal of `(i + 1)`.

This will avoid the division operation and improve the performance of the loop.

Step 9: Optimize the output operation

The program is using `endl` to output a newline character. However, `endl` also flushes the output stream which can be slow.

We can optimize the output operation by using `'\n'` to output a newline character without flushing the output stream.

Step 10: Use `size_t` for indices

The program is using `int` for the loop indices. However, `size_t` is a more appropriate type for indices.

Now, let's generate the optimized program.
