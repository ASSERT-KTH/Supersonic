To optimize the given C/C++ program, I would suggest the following steps:

1. Remove unnecessary `#include` directives. The program only needs `<iostream>`, `<vector>`, and `<algorithm>`. The `<bits/stdc++.h>` header is not necessary and can be removed.
2. Remove unnecessary preprocessor directives. The program does not use the `TeFa` or `IOT` directives, so they can be removed.
3. Remove unused variables. The variables `it`, `z`, and `Mx` are not used in the program and can be safely removed.
4. Avoid using `std::endl`. Instead, use the newline character `'\n'` for better performance.
5. Use `reserve()` function to preallocate memory for the vector `v` to avoid unnecessary memory reallocations.
6. Avoid unnecessary type conversions. The program unnecessarily converts the sum `sm` to a `long double` type. Instead, keep it as a `ll` type.
7. Avoid unnecessary sorting. The vector `v` is sorted in descending order, but it doesn't affect the result. So, remove the sorting step to improve performance.
8. Avoid unnecessary division operations. Instead of dividing `sm` by `(i + 1)` to calculate the average, calculate the average by dividing `sm` by `nn` directly.

Here is the optimized C++ program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0);
  cin.tie(0);

  int t;
  cin >> t;

  while (t--) {
    int nn, m;
    cin >> nn >> m;

    vector<int> v;
    v.reserve(nn);

    long long sm = 0;
    int cnt = 0;

    for (int i = 0; i < nn; i++) {
      int n;
      cin >> n;
      v.push_back(n);
      sm += n;
      if ((sm / nn) >= m)
        cnt++;
    }

    cout << cnt << "\n";
  }

  return 0;
}
```
