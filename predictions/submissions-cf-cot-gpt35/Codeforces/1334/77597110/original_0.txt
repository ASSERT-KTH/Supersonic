Step 1: Remove unnecessary headers
The program includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header, which is not necessary. We can remove this header as it includes a lot of other headers that are not required in this program.

Step 2: Remove unnecessary preprocessor definitions
There are some unnecessary preprocessor definitions in the program. We can remove the following lines:
- `#define ll long long`
- `#define ld long double`
- `#define E endl`
- `#define ull unsigned long long`
- `#define TeFa`
- `#define in cin`
- `#define Mod 1000000007`

Step 3: Use `'\n'` instead of `endl`
The program uses `endl` to print a newline character. However, `endl` also flushes the output buffer, which can be an expensive operation. We can replace `endl` with `'\n'` to only print a newline character without flushing the output buffer.

Step 4: Remove unnecessary variables
The variables `it`, `z`, and `Mx` are declared but not used in the program. We can remove these variables to simplify the code.

Step 5: Use `reserve` function to optimize vector memory allocation
The program uses a vector `v` to store input numbers. We can optimize the memory usage by reserving memory for `v` using the `reserve` function. Since the size of `v` is known in advance, we can reserve the required memory to avoid unnecessary reallocations.

Step 6: Use `emplace_back` instead of `push_back`
Instead of using `push_back` to add elements to the vector `v`, we can use `emplace_back` to construct the elements in-place, which can be more efficient.

Step 7: Use `size_t` for array indices
The for loops in the program use the `int` data type for array indices. It is recommended to use the `size_t` data type for array indices to avoid potential overflow issues.

Step 8: Avoid unnecessary division operations
In the second for loop, the program divides `sm` by `(i + 1)` to calculate the average at each index. This division operation can be expensive. Instead, we can multiply `sm` by the inverse of `(i + 1)` to avoid the division operation.

Step 9: Avoid unnecessary floating-point calculations
The program uses a floating-point array `arr` to store the averages. However, we only need to compare the averages with `m`, which is an integer. We can avoid the floating-point calculations and use integers instead.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

int main() {
  std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  std::cin.tie(nullptr);

  int t;
  std::cin >> t;

  while (t--) {
    int nn, m;
    std::cin >> nn >> m;

    std::vector<int> v;
    v.reserve(nn);

    int sm = 0;
    int cnt = 0;

    for (int i = 0; i < nn; i++) {
      int n;
      std::cin >> n;
      v.emplace_back(n);
    }

    std::sort(v.rbegin(), v.rend());

    for (size_t i = 0; i < v.size(); i++) {
      sm += v[i];
      if (sm >= (m * (i + 1)))
        cnt++;
    }

    std::cout << cnt << '\n';
  }

  return 0;
}
```
