This program can be optimized in several ways:

1. Remove unnecessary header files: The program includes `<bits/stdc++.h>` and `<limits>` header files, which are not needed for this program.

2. Remove unnecessary preprocessor macros: The program defines several preprocessor macros (`ll`, `ld`, `E`, `ull`, `TeFa`, `in`, `Mod`) that are not used in the code. These macros can be removed.

3. Remove unnecessary variable declarations: The program declares several variables (`it`, `z`, `Mx`) that are not used in the code. These variables can be removed.

4. Optimize the input and output operations: The program uses `cin` and `cout` for input and output operations, which are slower compared to other input/output methods. Using `scanf` and `printf` functions can improve the performance.

5. Avoid unnecessary vector operations: The program uses a vector `v` to store the input values and then sorts it. Instead, we can directly sort the input values without using a vector, which can save memory usage.

6. Avoid unnecessary floating-point calculations: The program uses floating-point calculations to calculate the average value. Since the program only checks if the average is greater than or equal to `m`, we can avoid the floating-point calculations by checking if the sum of the values is greater than or equal to `m * (i + 1)`.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);

  int t;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    int nn, m;
    cin >> nn >> m;

    int arr[nn];
    for (int i = 0; i < nn; i++) {
      cin >> arr[i];
    }

    sort(arr, arr + nn);

    int cnt = 0;
    int sm = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < nn; i++) {
      sm += arr[i];
      if (sm >= m * (i + 1)) {
        cnt++;
      }
    }

    cout << cnt << endl;
  }

  return 0;
}
```

Explanation of optimizations:

1. The unnecessary header files `<bits/stdc++.h>` and `<limits>` are removed.

2. The unnecessary preprocessor macros (`ll`, `ld`, `E`, `ull`, `TeFa`, `in`, `Mod`) are removed.

3. The unnecessary variable declarations (`it`, `z`, `Mx`) are removed.

4. The input and output operations are optimized to use `cin` and `cout` functions.

5. The vector `v` and its associated operations are removed. Instead, the input values are directly stored in an array `arr`.

6. The floating-point calculations to calculate the average value are replaced with integer calculations to check if the sum is greater than or equal to `m * (i + 1)`.
