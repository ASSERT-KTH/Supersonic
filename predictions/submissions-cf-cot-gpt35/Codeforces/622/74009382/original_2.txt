Optimization Steps:

1. Remove unnecessary header file inclusion: The program includes the `bits/stdc++.h` header file, which includes a large number of standard library headers. This can increase the compilation time. Instead, we should include the specific headers that are required for the program.

2. Avoid using macros: The program defines several macros, such as `pb`, `ppb`, `pf`, etc. These macros can make the code harder to read and understand. It is better to use explicit function calls instead of macros.

3. Avoid using `using namespace std`: The program uses the `using namespace std` directive, which brings all the names from the `std` namespace into the global namespace. This can lead to naming conflicts and make the code harder to maintain. It is better to use the `std::` prefix for standard library names.

4. Avoid unnecessary type definitions: The program defines `int` as `long long`. This can lead to unnecessary memory usage. It is better to use `int` directly.

5. Avoid unnecessary operator overloading: The program defines several operator overloads for the `pair` and `mod_int` types. These operator overloads are not used in the program and can be removed.

6. Avoid unnecessary functions and variables: The program defines several functions and variables that are not used in the program. These can be removed to reduce memory usage.

7. Avoid unnecessary calculations: The program performs some unnecessary calculations, such as calculating `P[i]` for values of `i` that are greater than `k+4`. These calculations can be avoided to improve the running time.

8. Avoid unnecessary loops: The program uses a loop to calculate `ele[1]`, but it can be calculated directly without the loop.

9. Avoid unnecessary divisions: The program performs several divisions, which can be expensive in terms of performance. We can try to avoid these divisions by rearranging the calculations.

10. Avoid unnecessary multiplications: The program performs several multiplications, which can also be expensive in terms of performance. We can try to minimize these multiplications by rearranging the calculations.

11. Avoid unnecessary modulo operations: The program uses the `MOD` constant for modulo operations, but it is not necessary. We can remove the modulo operations to improve the running time.

Optimized Program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

const int MOD = 1000000007;

struct mod_int {
  int val;
  
  explicit mod_int(long long v = 0) {
    if (v < 0)
      v = v % MOD + MOD;
    if (v >= MOD)
      v %= MOD;
    val = v;
  }
  
  mod_int& operator+=(const mod_int& other) {
    val += other.val;
    if (val >= MOD)
      val -= MOD;
    return *this;
  }
  
  mod_int& operator-=(const mod_int& other) {
    val -= other.val;
    if (val < 0)
      val += MOD;
    return *this;
  }
  
  mod_int& operator*=(const mod_int& other) {
    val = (1LL * val * other.val) % MOD;
    return *this;
  }
  
  mod_int operator+(const mod_int& other) const {
    return mod_int(*this) += other;
  }
  
  mod_int operator-(const mod_int& other) const {
    return mod_int(*this) -= other;
  }
  
  mod_int operator*(const mod_int& other) const {
    return mod_int(*this) *= other;
  }
  
  mod_int pow(long long p) const {
    assert(p >= 0);
    mod_int a = *this, result = 1;
    while (p > 0) {
      if (p & 1)
        result *= a;
      a *= a;
      p >>= 1;
    }
    return result;
  }
  
  friend std::ostream& operator<<(std::ostream& stream, const mod_int& m) {
    return stream << m.val;
  }
};

void solve() {
  int n, k;
  std::cin >> n >> k;
  
  mod_int ans = 0;
  mod_int ele = 1;
  
  for (int i = 1; i <= k + 2; i++) {
    ele *= (n - i + M);
    ele /= (i - 1);
    ele *= (n - i + 1);
    
    ans += ele * (i * i);
  }
  
  std::cout << ans << std::endl;
}

int main() {
  std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  std::cin.tie(0);
  std::cout.tie(0);
  
  int t = 1;
  while (t--)
    solve();
  
  return 0;
}
```
