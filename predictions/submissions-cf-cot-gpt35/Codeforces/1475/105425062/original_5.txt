To optimize the given program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary header files: The program includes several unnecessary header files that are not used. We can remove them to improve compilation time and reduce memory usage.

2. Remove unused macros: The program defines a macro `LSOne(S)`, but it is not used anywhere in the code. We can remove this macro to simplify the code.

3. Optimize vector initialization: The program initializes two vectors `cnt` and `dp` with a size of 2e5 + 1 and all elements set to 0. Instead of initializing the vectors with this size, we can initialize them with a size of `n` since the maximum value of `n` is given as the input. This will reduce memory usage.

4. Use a more efficient way to calculate the square root: In the inner loop, the program uses `sqrt(i)` to calculate the square root of `i`. However, the `sqrt` function is relatively slow compared to other operations. We can optimize this by using `j * j <= i` instead of `sqrt(i)`. This will improve the performance of the inner loop.

5. Remove unnecessary sorting: The program sorts the vector `v` using `sort` function, but it is not required for the given task. Since the goal is to optimize the program for running time, we can remove this unnecessary sorting step to improve the overall performance.

6. Optimize the inner loop: The inner loop checks if `i` is divisible by `j` and calculates the maximum value of `dp[j]` and `dp[i / j]`. However, we can optimize the inner loop by calculating the maximum value of `dp[j]` and `dp[i / j]` only once and storing it in a variable. This will reduce the number of redundant calculations and improve the performance of the inner loop.

7. Optimize the calculation of `best`: The program iterates over `dp` array to find the maximum value of `dp[i]` and store it in the variable `best`. However, we can optimize this by keeping track of the maximum value of `dp[i]` while calculating it in the inner loop. This will eliminate the need for an additional loop and improve the performance.

Here is the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <cmath>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  
  int t;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    int n;
    cin >> n;
    
    vector<long long> v(n);
    vector<long long> cnt(n+1, 0);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      cin >> v[i];
      cnt[v[i]]++;
    }

    vector<long long> dp(n+1, 0);
    long long best = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
      if (cnt[i] == 0)
        continue;

      long long max_dp = 0;
      for (int j = 2; j * j <= i; j++) {
        if (i % j == 0) {
          max_dp = max(max_dp, max(dp[j], dp[i/j]));
        }
      }
      dp[i] = max(max_dp, dp[1]) + cnt[i];
      best = max(best, dp[i]);
    }
    
    cout << n - best << '\n';
  }
  
  return 0;
}
```

By making these optimizations, we have improved the running time and reduced the memory usage of the program.
