Optimization Steps:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The program includes several unnecessary headers such as `<algorithm>`, `<climits>`, `<cmath>`, `<iomanip>`, `<iterator>`, `<list>`, `<map>`, `<numeric>`, `<queue>`, `<set>`, `<stack>`, `<tuple>`. These headers are not used in the program and can be removed.

2. Remove unused macros: The macro `LSOne(S)` is defined but not used in the program. It can be removed.

3. Remove unused constants: The constants `P` and `EPS` are defined but not used in the program. They can be removed.

4. Use `vector<int>` instead of `vector<long long>`: The vectors `v`, `cnt`, and `dp` are defined as `vector<long long>`, but they can be changed to `vector<int>` since the maximum value used is `2e5 + 1`, which can be represented by an `int`.

5. Use `reserve()` for vectors: The vector `v` is resized to size `n` using `vector<long long> v(n)`. Instead, we can use `v.reserve(n)` to pre-allocate memory without initializing the elements. This can improve performance by avoiding unnecessary memory reallocations.

6. Use `cin` and `cout` with synchronization: The program uses `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false)` to disable synchronization between `cin` and `cout`. However, this synchronization can be useful in some cases. It is recommended to remove this line unless a specific need for unsynchronized input/output is required.

Optimized Code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <cmath>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int t;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    int n;
    cin >> n;
    vector<int> v;
    v.reserve(n);
    vector<int> cnt(2e5 + 1, 0);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      int num;
      cin >> num;
      v.push_back(num);
      cnt[num]++;
    }
    sort(v.begin(), v.end());
    vector<int> dp(2e5 + 1, 0);
    int best = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i < dp.size(); i++) {
      if (cnt[i] == 0)
        continue;
      for (int j = 2; j <= sqrt(i); j++) {
        if (i % j == 0) {
          dp[i] = max(dp[i], max(dp[j], dp[i / j]));
        }
      }
      dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[1]);
      dp[i] += cnt[i];
      best = max(best, dp[i]);
    }
    cout << n - best << '\n';
  }
}
```

Explanation:

1. Unnecessary includes are removed.
2. The `LSOne(S)` macro is removed.
3. The `P` and `EPS` constants are removed.
4. The vectors `v`, `cnt`, and `dp` are changed to `vector<int>`.
5. The `v` vector is modified to use `reserve(n)` instead of resizing.
6. The synchronization line `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false)` is removed.
