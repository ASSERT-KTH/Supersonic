To optimize the given C/C++ program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary header files: The program includes several header files that are not used. We can remove them to improve compilation time and reduce memory usage.

2. Use more efficient data structures: The program uses vectors and maps to store counts and results. However, in this case, we don't need to store counts for all possible values. We can optimize the program by using an unordered_map instead of a vector to store counts, as it provides faster average access time for unordered data.

3. Avoid unnecessary calculations: The program calculates the square root of each number in the loop. Instead, we can calculate the square root once and store it in a variable, then compare the number with the square root. This will reduce the number of calculations and improve performance.

4. Optimize the loop conditions: The outer loop runs from 1 to the size of the dp vector. However, we can optimize it by only looping through the numbers that have non-zero counts. This will reduce unnecessary iterations and improve performance.

Based on these optimizations, the optimized C/C++ program is as follows:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <vector>
#include <cmath>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  cout.tie(NULL);

  int t;
  cin >> t;

  while (t--) {
    int n;
    cin >> n;

    vector<long long> v(n);
    unordered_map<long long, long long> cnt;

    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      cin >> v[i];
      cnt[v[i]]++;
    }

    sort(v.begin(), v.end());

    vector<long long> dp(2e5 + 1, 0);
    long long best = 0;
    long long maxSqrt = sqrt(2e5);

    for (auto& c : cnt) {
      long long i = c.first;

      if (c.second == 0)
        continue;

      for (long long j = 2; j <= maxSqrt; j++) {
        if (i % j == 0) {
          dp[i] = max({dp[i], dp[j], dp[i / j]});
        }
      }

      dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[1]);
      dp[i] += c.second;
      best = max(best, dp[i]);
    }

    cout << n - best << '\n';
  }
}
```

These optimizations should result in improved running time and reduced memory usage compared to the original program.
