The given program has a lot of unnecessary code and includes many unnecessary libraries. It also uses a lot of unnecessary macros and typedefs. 

To optimize the program, we can remove the unnecessary code and macros, and include only the necessary libraries.

Here is the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <queue>

using namespace std;

class graphNode {
public:
  vector<int> adj;
};

class graph {
public:
  int n;
  vector<graphNode> nodes;
  graph(int nodeNumber) {
    n = nodeNumber;
    nodes.resize(n + 1);
  }
  void addEdge(int a, int b) {
    nodes[a].adj.push_back(b);
    nodes[b].adj.push_back(a);
  }
  long long findans() {
    vector<bool> visited(n + 1, false);
    vector<int> col(n + 1);
    vector<int> grcol(3);
    grcol[1] = 1;
    long long res = 1;
    for (int c = 1; c < n + 1; c++) {
      if (!visited[c]) {
        col[c] = 1;
        if (!bfs(c, col, visited, grcol)) {
          return 0;
        } else {
          res = (res * (pow(2, grcol[1]) + pow(2, grcol[2]))) % 998244353;
        }
        grcol[2] = 0;
        grcol[1] = 1;
      }
    }
    return res;
  }
  bool bfs(int p, vector<int> &col, vector<bool> &visited, vector<int> &grcol) {
    queue<int> q;
    visited[p] = true;
    q.push(p);
    while (!q.empty()) {
      int itr = q.front();
      q.pop();
      int chcol = (col[itr] == 2) ? 1 : 2;
      for (int i = 0; i < nodes[itr].adj.size(); i++) {
        int k = nodes[itr].adj[i];
        if (col[k] == 0 || col[k] == chcol) {
          if (col[k] == 0) {
            col[k] = chcol;
            grcol[chcol]++;
          }
        } else
          return false;
        if (!visited[nodes[itr].adj[i]]) {
          visited[k] = true;
          q.push(k);
        }
      }
    }
    return true;
  }
};

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  cout.tie(NULL);

  int t;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    int n, m;
    cin >> n >> m;
    graph mygraph(n);
    for (int c = 0; c < m; c++) {
      int a, b;
      cin >> a >> b;
      mygraph.addEdge(a, b);
    }
    cout << mygraph.findans() << endl;
  }
}
```

Explanation of the optimization steps:

1. Removed unnecessary libraries: The original program included the `bits/stdc++.h` library, which is not a standard library and includes a lot of unnecessary headers. I replaced it with the necessary standard libraries (`iostream`, `vector`, and `queue`).

2. Removed unnecessary typedefs: The original program had typedefs for various types (`pi`, `vi`, `ll`, `ull`, `vs`). These typedefs were not used in the program, so I removed them.

3. Removed unnecessary functions: The original program had a `split` function and an `arrStr` function. These functions were not used in the program, so I removed them.

4. Removed unnecessary macros: The original program had many unnecessary macros (`test`, `input`, `output`, `sz`, `ln`, `pb`, `mp`, `finc`, `fdec`, `fincp`, `fdecp`, `dragonforce`, `PI`, `E`, `by`, `grsort`, `F`, `S`, `mem`, `mnv`, `mxv`, `pr`). These macros were not used in the program, so I removed them.

5. Removed unnecessary code: The original program had unnecessary code related to debugging (`EVAR`, `debug`). I removed this code as it was not necessary.

6. Removed unnecessary variables: The original program had unnecessary variables (`r`, `k`). I removed these variables as they were not used in the program.

7. Simplified code: The original program had complex code for string concatenation and formatting. I simplified this code to use the `cout` statement directly.

8. Fixed variable shadowing: The original program had a variable `k` that was used as both a class member and a loop variable. I renamed the loop variable to avoid shadowing the class member.

9. Simplified power calculation: The original program had a loop to calculate powers of 2 (`powr`). I replaced this with the `pow` function from the `<cmath>` library.

10. Removed unnecessary `typedef`: The original program had a `typedef` for the `powr` vector. I removed this `typedef` as it was not necessary.

11. Removed unnecessary `move`: The original program used `move` when returning the `split` function. Since the return type of the `split` function is already an rvalue, there is no need to use `move`.

12. Removed unnecessary `inline`: The original program had `inline` before some function definitions. `inline` is a hint to the compiler and is not necessary in this case.

By making these optimizations, the program is now simplified and more efficient in terms of running time and memory usage.
