The given program is a C++ program that finds the number of valid colorings of a graph. The program uses a graph class and a graph node class to represent the graph and perform the necessary operations.

To optimize the program, I would suggest the following steps:

1. Remove unnecessary header files: The program includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header file, which is not a standard C++ header file. It is recommended to include only the necessary standard header files that are actually used in the program.

2. Remove unnecessary typedefs: The program includes several typedefs that are not used in the program. These typedefs can be removed to simplify the code.

3. Remove unnecessary functions: The program includes several unnecessary functions like `split` and `arrStr`. These functions are not used in the program and can be removed.

4. Remove unnecessary macros: The program includes several unnecessary macros like `mod`, `MAX`, `sz`, `ln`, etc. These macros are not used in the program and can be removed.

5. Remove unnecessary template functions: The program includes a template function `get()` that is not used in the program. This function can be removed.

6. Remove unnecessary global variables: The program includes unnecessary global variables like `r`, `n`, `k`, etc. These variables are not used in the program and can be removed.

7. Remove unnecessary class constructors: The program includes a constructor for the `graphNode` class that is not used. This constructor can be removed.

8. Avoid unnecessary copying of vectors: The program uses `emplace_back` to add elements to vectors. However, in some cases, the use of `emplace_back` can result in unnecessary copying of elements. It is recommended to use `push_back` instead to avoid this unnecessary copying.

9. Avoid unnecessary variable assignments: The program includes some unnecessary variable assignments like `grcol[2] = 0;` and `grcol[1] = 1;`. These assignments can be removed as the variables are assigned new values in the next loop iteration.

10. Optimize the calculation of powr vector: The program initializes the powr vector with powers of 2. However, the powr vector is calculated in a loop, which can be optimized to use the `pow` function to calculate the powers of 2.

11. Optimize the findans function: The findans function calculates the result by multiplying powers of 2. This multiplication can be optimized by calculating the powers of 2 modulo 998244353 and using the property `(a * b) % m = ((a % m) * (b % m)) % m`.

12. Avoid unnecessary memory allocation: The program uses a vector of bools to keep track of visited nodes. However, a vector of bools can be memory inefficient. It is recommended to use a vector of chars or bits instead.

Based on these optimizations, here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
using namespace std;

class graphNode {
public:
  vector<int> adj;
};

class graph {
public:
  int n;
  vector<graphNode> nodes;

  graph(int nodeNumber) {
    n = nodeNumber;
    nodes.resize(n + 1);
  }

  void addEdge(int a, int b) {
    nodes[a].adj.push_back(b);
    nodes[b].adj.push_back(a);
  }

  long long findans() {
    vector<char> visited(n + 1, 0);
    vector<int> col(n + 1);
    vector<int> grcol(3);
    grcol[1] = 1;
    long long res = 1;

    for (int c = 1; c < n + 1; c++) {
      if (!visited[c]) {
        col[c] = 1;
        if (!bfs(c, col, visited, grcol)) {
          return 0;
        } else {
          res = (res * (powr[grcol[1]] + powr[grcol[2]])) % 998244353;
        }
        grcol[2] = 0;
        grcol[1] = 1;
      }
    }
    return res;
  }

  bool bfs(int p, vector<int> &col, vector<char> &visited, vector<int> &grcol) {
    queue<int> q;
    visited[p] = 1;
    q.push(p);

    while (!q.empty()) {
      int itr = q.front();
      q.pop();
      int chcol = (col[itr] == 2) ? 1 : 2;

      for (int i = 0; i < nodes[itr].adj.size(); i++) {
        int k = nodes[itr].adj[i];
        if (col[k] == 0 || col[k] == chcol) {
          if (col[k] == 0) {
            col[k] = chcol;
            grcol[chcol]++;
          }
        } else {
          return false;
        }
        if (!visited[nodes[itr].adj[i]]) {
          visited[k] = 1;
          q.push(k);
        }
      }
    }
    return true;
  }
};

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  cout.tie(NULL);

  vector<long long> powr(3 * 100000);
  long long k = 1;
  for (int c = 0; c < 3 * 100000; c++) {
    powr[c] = k;
    k = (k * 2) % 998244353;
  }

  int t;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    int n, m;
    cin >> n >> m;
    graph mygraph(n);
    for (int c = 0; c < m; c++) {
      int a, b;
      cin >> a >> b;
      mygraph.addEdge(a, b);
    }
    cout << mygraph.findans() << endl;
  }

  return 0;
}
```

This optimized code removes unnecessary code and improves the efficiency of the original program. It should provide better performance in terms of running time and memory usage.
