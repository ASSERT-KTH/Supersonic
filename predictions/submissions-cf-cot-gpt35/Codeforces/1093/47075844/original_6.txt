To optimize the given program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The program includes `<bits/stdc++.h>`, which includes a lot of unnecessary headers. We can remove this line and include only the necessary headers.

2. Remove unnecessary typedefs: The program includes several typedefs that are not used. We can remove these typedefs to simplify the code.

3. Remove unnecessary macros: The program includes several macros that are not used. We can remove these macros to simplify the code.

4. Remove unnecessary functions: The program includes several unnecessary functions that are not used. We can remove these functions to simplify the code.

5. Remove unnecessary variables: The program includes unnecessary variables that are not used. We can remove these variables to simplify the code.

6. Simplify the loop conditions: The program includes loop conditions that can be simplified. We can simplify these conditions to improve the readability of the code.

7. Simplify the graphNode class: The graphNode class has an unnecessary member variable "a" that is not used. We can remove this member variable to simplify the code.

8. Simplify the graph class: The graph class has an unnecessary member variable "n" that is not used. We can remove this member variable to simplify the code.

9. Simplify the bfs function: The bfs function has unnecessary variables and conditions that can be removed. We can simplify this function to improve the readability of the code.

10. Use reserve instead of resize: In the main function, the nodes vector is resized to n + 1. We can use reserve instead of resize to improve the performance of the code.

11. Use emplace_back instead of push_back: In the addEdge function, the adj and wt vectors are populated using push_back. We can use emplace_back instead of push_back to improve the performance of the code.

12. Use const reference in function parameters: In the bfs function, the col, visited, and grcol vectors are passed by value. We can pass them by const reference to avoid unnecessary copying.

13. Remove unnecessary return statements: In the bfs function, there are unnecessary return statements. We can remove these return statements to simplify the code.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <queue>

class graphNode {
public:
  std::vector<int> adj, wt;
};

class graph {
public:

    nodes[a].adj.emplace_back(b);
    nodes[b].adj.emplace_back(a);
    if (weighted) {
      nodes[a].wt.emplace_back(weight);
      nodes[b].wt.emplace_back(weight);
    }
  }

    long long res = 1;
    for (int c = 1; c < nodes.size(); c++) {
      if (!visited[c]) {
        col[c] = 1;
        if (!bfs(c, col, visited, grcol)) {
          return 0;
        } else {
          res = (res * (powr[grcol[1]] + powr[grcol[2]])) % 998244353;
        }
        grcol[2] = 0;
        grcol[1] = 1;
      }
    }
    return res;
  }
  bool bfs(int p, const std::vector<int>& col, std::vector<bool>& visited, std::vector<int>& grcol) {
    std::queue<int> q;
    visited[p] = true;
    q.push(p);
    while (!q.empty()) {
      int itr = q.front();
      q.pop();
      int chcol = (col[itr] == 2) ? 1 : 2;
      for (int i = 0; i < nodes[itr].adj.size(); i++) {
        int k = nodes[itr].adj[i];
        if (col[k] == 0 || col[k] == chcol) {
          if (col[k] == 0) {
            col[k] = chcol;
            grcol[chcol]++;
          }
        } else
          return false;
        if (!visited[k]) {
          visited[k] = true;
          q.push(k);
        }
      }
    }
    return true;
  }
};

int main() {
  std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  std::cin.tie(NULL);
  std::cout.tie(NULL);

  std::vector<int> powr(3 * 100000);
  long long k = 1;
  for (int c = 0; c < 3 * 100000; c++) {
    powr[c] = k;
    k = (k * 2) % 998244353;
  }

  int o;
  std::cin >> o;
  while (o--) {
    int n, m;
    std::cin >> n >> m;
    graph mygraph(n);
    for (int c = 0; c < m; c++) {
      int a, b;
      std::cin >> a >> b;
      mygraph.addEdge(a, b);
    }
    std::cout << mygraph.findans() << std::endl;
  }

  return 0;
}
```
