The given program is a C++ program that solves a graph coloring problem. The program uses a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to color the nodes of the graph using two colors. The program then calculates the result by multiplying the powers of 2 corresponding to the number of nodes of each color.

To optimize the program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary header files: The program includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header file, which includes a large number of standard library headers. We can remove this line and include only the necessary headers.

2. Remove unnecessary typedefs: The program defines several typedefs that are not used. We can remove these typedefs to simplify the code.

3. Remove unnecessary functions: The program defines several utility functions that are not used. We can remove these functions to reduce code complexity and improve readability.

4. Remove unnecessary macros: The program defines several macros that are not used. We can remove these macros to reduce code complexity and improve readability.

5. Remove unnecessary variables: The program declares several variables that are not used. We can remove these variables to reduce memory usage.

6. Optimize the BFS algorithm: The BFS algorithm in the program can be optimized by avoiding unnecessary checks and assignments. We can simplify the BFS algorithm to improve its performance.

7. Optimize the calculation of powers of 2: The program pre-calculates powers of 2 up to a certain limit and stores them in a vector. We can optimize this calculation by using bitwise shift operations instead of multiplication.

8. Use a more efficient data structure: The program uses a vector of pairs to represent the adjacency list of the graph. We can use a more efficient data structure, such as an array of vectors, to represent the adjacency list.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <queue>

using namespace std;

class graph {
public:
  int n;
  vector<vector<int>> adj;
  graph(int nodeNumber) {
    n = nodeNumber;
    adj.resize(n + 1);
  }
  void addEdge(int a, int b) {
    adj[a].push_back(b);
    adj[b].push_back(a);
  }
  unsigned long long findans() {
    vector<bool> visited(n + 1, false);
    vector<int> col(n + 1);
    vector<int> grcol(3);
    grcol[1] = 1;
    unsigned long long res = 1;
    for (int c = 1; c < n + 1; c++) {
      if (!visited[c]) {
        col[c] = 1;
        if (!bfs(c, col, visited, grcol)) {
          return 0;
        } else {
          res = (res * (1ULL << grcol[1]) + (1ULL << grcol[2])) % 998244353;
        }
        grcol[2] = 0;
        grcol[1] = 1;
      }
    }
    return res;
  }
  bool bfs(int p, vector<int>& col, vector<bool>& visited, vector<int>& grcol) {
    queue<int> q;
    visited[p] = true;
    q.push(p);
    while (!q.empty()) {
      int itr = q.front();
      q.pop();
      int chcol = (col[itr] == 2) ? 1 : 2;
      for (int i = 0; i < adj[itr].size(); i++) {
        int k = adj[itr][i];
        if (col[k] == 0 || col[k] == chcol) {
          if (col[k] == 0) {
            col[k] = chcol;
            grcol[chcol]++;
          }
        } else {
          return false;
        }
        if (!visited[k]) {
          visited[k] = true;
          q.push(k);
        }
      }
    }
    return true;
  }
};

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  cout.tie(NULL);

  int t;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    int n, m;
    cin >> n >> m;
    graph mygraph(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
      int a, b;
      cin >> a >> b;
      mygraph.addEdge(a, b);
    }
    cout << mygraph.findans() << endl;
  }

  return 0;
}
```

Explanation of the optimizations:

1. Removed unnecessary header files: The program only needs the `<iostream>`, `<vector>`, and `<queue>` header files. The `<bits/stdc++.h>` header file is not necessary and can be removed.

2. Removed unnecessary typedefs: The typedefs for `pi`, `vi`, `ll`, `ull`, and `vs` are not used and can be removed.

3. Removed unnecessary functions: The `split` and `arrStr` functions are not used and can be removed.

4. Removed unnecessary macros: The `debug`, `mod`, `MAX`, `test`, `input`, `output`, `sz`, `ln`, `pb`, `mp`, `all`, `finc`, `fdec`, `fincp`, `fdecp`, `dragonforce`, `PI`, `E`, `by`, `grsort`, `F`, `S`, `mem`, `mnv`, `mxv`, and `pr` macros are not used and can be removed.

5. Removed unnecessary variables: The variables `r`, `k`, `powr`, `a`, and `nodes` are not used and can be removed.

6. Optimized the BFS algorithm: The BFS algorithm has been simplified by removing unnecessary checks and assignments. The variables `c` and `k` have been declared within the loop to avoid unnecessary global variables.

7. Optimized the calculation of powers of 2: The calculation of powers of 2 has been optimized using bitwise shift operations (`1ULL << grcol[1]` and `1ULL << grcol[2]`) instead of multiplication.

8. Used a more efficient data structure: The adjacency list has been changed from a vector of pairs to an array of vectors (`vector<vector<int>> adj`). This allows for more efficient access to the adjacent nodes.

These optimizations should improve the running time and memory usage of the program.
