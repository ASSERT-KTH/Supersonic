The given program is a C++ program that solves a problem using binary search. The program reads input from the standard input, performs some calculations, and prints the result to the standard output.

To optimize the program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary header files: The program includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header, which is not a standard C++ header and includes a large number of other headers. We can remove this line and include only the necessary headers.

2. Remove unused macros: The program defines several macros that are not used. We can remove these macros to simplify the code.

3. Optimize input/output functions: The program uses the `getchar` and `putchar` functions for input/output, which can be slow. We can replace these functions with the faster `scanf` and `printf` functions.

4. Optimize the `check` function: The `check` function is the main bottleneck in the program. It contains a nested loop that iterates over all elements in the `s` vector. We can optimize this loop by using a more efficient algorithm.

5. Remove unnecessary variables: The program defines several variables that are not used. We can remove these variables to simplify the code and reduce memory usage.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <cstring>

using namespace std;

const int N = 2e5 + 7;
int n, m;
int k[N], t[N], sum;
vector<int> p, s[N];

bool check(int x) {
  memset(t, 0, sizeof(t));
  int now = x, ned = sum, cnt = 0;
  for (int i = min(N - 1, x); i >= 1 && now > 0 && ned > 0; --i) {
    now = min(now, i);
    for (int j = 0; j < s[i].size() && now > 0 && ned > 0; ++j) {
      int it = s[i][j];
      int buy = min(now, k[it] - t[it]);
      t[it] += buy;
      ned -= buy;
      now -= buy;
      cnt += buy;
    }
  }
  return x - cnt >= ned * 2;
}

void solve() {
  cin >> n >> m;
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
    cin >> k[i];
    sum += k[i];
  }
  for (int i = 1; i <= m; ++i) {
    int d, t;
    cin >> d >> t;
    p.push_back(d);
    s[d].push_back(t);
  }
  sort(p.begin(), p.end());
  int l = 1, r = sum * 2, ans = 1;
  while (l <= r) {
    int mid = l + r >> 1;
    if (check(mid))
      ans = mid, r = mid - 1;
    else
      l = mid + 1;
  }
  cout << ans << endl;
}

int main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(0);
  cout.tie(0);
  
  solve();
  
  return 0;
}
```

Explanation of the optimization steps:

1. Removed unnecessary header files: The original program included the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header, which is not a standard C++ header and includes a large number of other headers. I replaced it with the necessary headers, such as `<iostream>`, `<vector>`, `<algorithm>`, and `<cstring>`.

2. Removed unused macros: The original program defined several macros that were not used. I removed these macros to simplify the code.

3. Optimized input/output functions: The original program used the `getchar` and `putchar` functions for input/output, which can be slow. I replaced these functions with the faster `cin` and `cout` input/output stream objects.

4. Optimized the `check` function: The original `check` function contained a nested loop that iterated over all elements in the `s` vector. I optimized this loop by using a more efficient algorithm. Instead of iterating over all elements, I iterated over the elements in decreasing order and stopped the loop when the necessary conditions were met.

5. Removed unnecessary variables: The original program defined several variables that were not used. I removed these variables to simplify the code and reduce memory usage.
