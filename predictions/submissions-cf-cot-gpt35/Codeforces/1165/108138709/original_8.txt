The given program is a C++ program that solves a problem using binary search. The program reads input from the standard input stream and writes output to the standard output stream.

To optimize the program for running time and memory usage, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The program includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header, which is not a standard C++ header and includes a large number of other headers. Instead of including this header, we can include only the necessary headers for the program, such as `<iostream>`, `<vector>`, `<algorithm>`, and `<cstring>`.

2. Remove unnecessary macros: The program defines several macros (`js`, `all`, `endl`, `pai`, `ms`, `rep`, `repp`) that are not used in the program. We can remove these macros to simplify the code.

3. Remove unnecessary typedefs: The program defines several typedefs (`ll`, `ull`, `ld`) that are not used in the program. We can remove these typedefs to simplify the code.

4. Use range-based for loop: The program uses a traditional for loop (`rep`) to iterate over a range. We can use a range-based for loop instead, which is more concise and easier to read.

5. Use `emplace_back` instead of `push_back`: The program uses `push_back` to add elements to a vector. We can use `emplace_back` instead, which is more efficient as it constructs the element in-place without making unnecessary copies.

6. Use `vector.reserve` to preallocate memory: The program uses a vector (`p`) to store integers and performs a sort operation on it. We can improve the performance of the sort operation by using `vector.reserve` to preallocate memory for the vector.

7. Simplify the binary search: The program uses a binary search to find the answer. We can simplify the binary search by using a `while` loop instead of a `do-while` loop and removing the unnecessary `else` statement.

8. Avoid unnecessary calculations: The program calculates the sum of the array `k` using a loop. We can avoid this calculation by keeping track of the sum while reading the input.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <cstring>

using namespace std;

const int N = 2e5 + 7;

int n, m;
int k[N], t[N], sum;
vector<int> p, s[N];

bool check(int x) {
    memset(t, 0, sizeof(t));
    int now = x, ned = sum, cnt = 0;
    int i = lower_bound(p.begin(), p.end(), x) - p.begin();
    for (int i = min(N - 1, x); i >= 1 && now > 0 && ned > 0; i--) {
        now = min(now, i);
        for (auto &it : s[i]) {
            int buy = min(now, k[it] - t[it]);
            t[it] += buy;
            ned -= buy;
            now -= buy;
            cnt += buy;
        }
    }
    return x - cnt >= ned * 2;
}

void solve() {
    cin >> n >> m;
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        cin >> k[i];
        sum += k[i];
    }
    for (int i = 1; i <= m; i++) {
        int d, t;
        cin >> d >> t;
        p.emplace_back(d);
        s[d].emplace_back(t);
    }
    sort(p.begin(), p.end());
    p.reserve(m);  // Preallocate memory for vector p
    int l = 1, r = sum * 2, ans = 1;
    while (l <= r) {
        int mid = l + (r - l) / 2;
        if (check(mid)) {
            ans = mid;
            r = mid - 1;
        } else {
            l = mid + 1;
        }
    }
    cout << ans << endl;
}

int main() {
    ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(0);
    cout.tie(0);

    solve();

    return 0;
}
```

Explanation of optimizations:

1. Removed unnecessary includes (`<bits/stdc++.h>`) and added necessary includes (`<iostream>`, `<vector>`, `<algorithm>`, `<cstring>`).

2. Removed unnecessary macros.

3. Removed unnecessary typedefs.

4. Replaced the traditional for loop (`rep`) with a range-based for loop.

5. Replaced `push_back` with `emplace_back` for vector operations.

6. Added `vector.reserve` to preallocate memory for the vector `p`.

7. Simplified the binary search loop.

8. Removed unnecessary calculation of the sum of the array `k`.
