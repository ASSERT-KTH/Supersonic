Step 1: 
One possible optimization is to avoid unnecessary copying of elements in the `solve` function. Currently, the `solve` function takes a vector `a` by value and modifies it in place. However, since the `a` vector is not modified outside of the `solve` function, we can pass it by reference instead to avoid the unnecessary copy.

Step 2: 
Another optimization we can make is to avoid unnecessary computation in the `solve` function. Currently, the `minmax_element` function is called to find the minimum and maximum elements of `a`. However, we can optimize this by keeping track of the minimum and maximum elements in separate variables as we iterate through the vector. This will eliminate the need for an additional pass through the vector.

Step 3: 
We can further optimize the `solve` function by removing the second loop that subtracts `max - min` from each element when `k` is even. Instead, we can calculate the difference `max - min` outside of the loop and subtract it from each element directly. This will eliminate the need for an additional loop.

Here is the optimized program with the above optimizations:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

template <typename T>
std::istream &operator>>(std::istream &input, std::vector<T> &v) {
  for (T &a : v)
    input >> a;
  return input;
}

void answer(const std::vector<int> &v) {
  const char *separator = "";
  for (const int x : v) {
    std::cout << separator << x;
    separator = " ";
  }
  std::cout << '\n';
}

void solve(std::vector<int> &a, unsigned long long k) {
  int min = a[0];
  int max = a[0];
  for (int x : a) {
    if (x < min)
      min = x;
    if (x > max)
      max = x;
  }

  for (int &x : a)
    x = max - x;

  if (k % 2 == 0) {
    int diff = max - min;
    for (int &x : a)
      x -= diff;
  }

  answer(a);
}

void test_case() {
  size_t n;
  std::cin >> n;
  unsigned long long k;
  std::cin >> k;
  std::vector<int> a(n);
  std::cin >> a;
  solve(a, k);
}

int main() {
  size_t t;
  std::cin >> t;
  while (t-- > 0)
    test_case();
  return 0;
}
```
