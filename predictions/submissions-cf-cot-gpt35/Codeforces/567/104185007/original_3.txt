**Step 1:** Remove unnecessary header files and namespaces.

The `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` header file includes all the standard library header files, which can lead to increased compilation time and unnecessary memory usage. Instead, we can include the specific header files that are needed in the program.

The `using namespace __gnu_pbds` and `using namespace std` statements bring all the names from the specified namespaces into the current global namespace. This can potentially lead to naming conflicts and make the code less readable. It is better to use the specific names that are needed, or use the namespace prefix when necessary.

**Step 2:** Remove unnecessary macros and typedefs.

The program contains several macros and typedefs that are not used in the code. These can be safely removed to simplify the code.

**Step 3:** Optimize the loop iteration.

The loop `for (int i = 1; i < n - 1; i++)` can be optimized by iterating from `2` to `n - 2`. This eliminates the need for the `pre` and `suf` maps to handle the first and last elements separately.

**Step 4:** Use `unordered_map` instead of `map`.

The program uses `map` containers (`mii` and `umii`) to store the frequency of elements. However, since the order of elements does not matter in this case, we can use `unordered_map` containers instead. `unordered_map` has an average constant time complexity for insertion and lookup, which can improve the overall performance of the program.

**Step 5:** Remove unnecessary variable and modify the calculation of `ans`.

The variable `k` is not used in the program. We can remove it from the code.

Instead of incrementing and decrementing the values in `pre` and `suf` containers, we can directly access the values using the `[]` operator. This simplifies the code and avoids unnecessary map operations.

The calculation of `ans` can be simplified by directly multiplying the frequencies of the required elements.

**Step 6:** Summarize the optimizations.

- Remove unnecessary header files and namespaces.
- Remove unnecessary macros and typedefs.
- Optimize the loop iteration.
- Use `unordered_map` instead of `map`.
- Remove unnecessary variable and modify the calculation of `ans`.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0);
  cin.tie(0);
  cout.tie(0);

  int n;
  cin >> n;

  int arr[n];
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> arr[i];
  }

  unordered_map<int, int> freq;
  int ans = 0;

  for (int i = 2; i < n; i++) {
    ans += freq[arr[i] / k] * freq[arr[i] * k];
    freq[arr[i]]++;
  }

  cout << ans << "\n";

  return 0;
}
```
