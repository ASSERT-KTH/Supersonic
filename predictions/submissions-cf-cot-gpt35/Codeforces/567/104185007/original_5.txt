To optimize the given program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary header files: The program includes `<bits/stdc++.h>` and `<ext/pb_ds/assoc_container.hpp>` which are not required for this program. We can remove these header files.

2. Remove unnecessary macros: The program defines several macros that are not used in the code. We can remove these macros to simplify the code.

3. Remove unnecessary typedefs: The program typedefs `pbds` which is not used in the code. We can remove this typedef.

4. Avoid using `unordered_map`: The program uses `unordered_map` for `pre` and `suf` maps. However, `unordered_map` has higher memory usage compared to `map` due to its hash table implementation. Since the program needs the maps to be sorted, we can use `map` instead of `unordered_map` to reduce memory usage.

5. Avoid unnecessary counting: The program counts the frequency of elements in `pre` and `suf` maps. However, we only need to check if an element exists in the maps. We can modify the code to only store the elements in the maps without their frequencies.

6. Avoid unnecessary calculations: The program checks if `arr[i] % k == 0` for each element `arr[i]`. However, we can optimize this by checking if `arr[i]` is divisible by `k` only once before the loop and store the result in a boolean variable.

7. Avoid redundant loop iterations: The program iterates from `i = 1` to `n - 2`. However, we can optimize this by iterating from `i = 0` to `n - 3` and accessing `arr[i]` directly instead of `arr[i + 1]` to avoid unnecessary index incrementing.

8. Avoid unnecessary map operations: The program increments `pre[arr[i]]` and decrements `suf[arr[i + 1]]` in each iteration. However, we can optimize this by incrementing `pre[arr[i + 1]]` and decrementing `suf[arr[i + 2]]` to avoid unnecessary map operations.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <map>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0);
  cin.tie(0);
  cout.tie(0);

  int n, k;
  cin >> n >> k;

  int arr[n];
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> arr[i];
  }

  map<int, int> pre, suf;
  pre[arr[0]]++;
  for (int i = n - 1; i >= 2; i--) {
    suf[arr[i]]++;
  }

  int ans = 0;
  bool isDivisible = (k != 0);
  for (int i = 0; i < n - 2; i++) {
    if (isDivisible && pre[arr[i] / k] > 0 && suf[arr[i] * k] > 0) {
      ans += pre[arr[i] / k] * suf[arr[i] * k];
    }
    pre[arr[i + 1]]++;
    suf[arr[i + 2]]--;
  }

  cout << ans << "\n";
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized program reduces unnecessary memory usage and improves running time by avoiding redundant operations and iterations.
