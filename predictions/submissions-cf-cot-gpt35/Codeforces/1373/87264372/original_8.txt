This program calculates the maximum sum that can be obtained from a given array by choosing a subset of elements with some specific conditions.

To optimize the program, we can make the following changes:

1. Remove unnecessary headers: The program includes `<bits/stdc++.h>`, which includes a large number of standard library headers. We can remove this line and only include the necessary headers.

2. Remove unnecessary preprocessor directives: The program has preprocessor directives such as `#pragma GCC optimize` and `#define` for constants. Since we are optimizing for running time and memory usage, these directives can be removed.

3. Remove unnecessary typedefs: The program has typedefs for `ll`, `vi`, `vll`, `vii`, `vlll`, `vb`, `pi`, and `pll`. These typedefs are not used in the program and can be removed.

4. Remove unnecessary constants: The program defines constants for `PI`, `MOD`, `EPS`, and `INF`. These constants are not used in the program and can be removed.

5. Use `reserve()` for vectors: The program creates vectors `ar` and `dp` without specifying their size. We can use the `reserve()` function to allocate memory for these vectors before using them.

6. Optimize the loop: The program uses a loop to read elements into the vector `ar`. We can optimize this loop by using `reserve()` to allocate memory for the vector `ar` before reading the elements.

7. Optimize the calculation: The program calculates the maximum sum using a nested loop. We can optimize this calculation by removing the nested loop and using a single loop to update the values in the `dp` vector.

8. Use a single `max` call: The program uses three separate `max` calls to calculate the maximum sum. We can optimize this by using a single `max` call to calculate the maximum sum directly.

Here is the optimized C++ program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int t;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    int n;
    cin >> n;
    vector<int> ar;
    ar.reserve(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
      int num;
      cin >> num;
      ar.push_back(num);
    }
    vector<long long> dp(n + 1, 0ll);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
      dp[i + 1] = dp[i] + (i & 1 ? 0 : ar[i]);
      if (i + 2 <= n)
        dp[i + 2] = max(dp[i], dp[i + 1]) + ar[(i % 2 == 0 ? i + 1 : i)];
      dp[i + 1] = max({dp[i], dp[i + 1], dp[i + 2], dp[i + 1]}) +
                  (i & 1 ? 0 : ar[i]);
    }
    cout << max({dp[n], dp[n - 1], dp[n - 2]}) << endl;
  }
}
```
