The given program is a solution to a dynamic programming problem. It computes the maximum sum of elements from an array with some restrictions.

To optimize the program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary header files: The program includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header file, which is not necessary and includes a large number of unnecessary header files. We can remove this line and only include the necessary header files: `<iostream>`, `<vector>`, and `<algorithm>`.

2. Avoid using namespace std: Instead of using `using namespace std;`, we can use the `std::` prefix for the standard library functions and types. This will avoid polluting the global namespace.

3. Avoid unnecessary preprocessor directives: The program has several unnecessary preprocessor directives like `#define`, `#pragma`, and `#ifndef`. We can remove them as they are not used in the program.

4. Avoid unnecessary typedefs: The program has several unnecessary typedefs like `typedef long long ll`, `typedef vector<int> vi`, etc. We can remove them and directly use the standard library types.

5. Avoid unnecessary constants: The program defines several unnecessary constants like `PI`, `MOD`, `EPS`, `INF`, etc. We can remove them as they are not used in the program.

6. Avoid unnecessary macros: The program defines several unnecessary macros like `db`, `DI`, `DLL`, etc. We can remove them as they are not used in the program.

7. Avoid unnecessary vectors and pairs: The program uses vectors and pairs unnecessarily to represent simple types like `int` and `ll`. We can directly use these types instead of vectors and pairs.

8. Avoid excessive function calls: The program makes multiple function calls to `max()` and `cin/cout`, which can be expensive. We can reduce the number of function calls by storing the results in variables.

9. Optimize loop conditions: The program uses `REP` macro to iterate over a range of values. We can replace it with a simple for loop to improve readability and performance.

10. Optimize memory usage: The program uses a 2D vector `dp` to store the dynamic programming table. We can optimize memory usage by using a 1D vector instead, as only the last row of the table is used in the computation.

11. Optimize variable initialization: The program initializes the vector `ar` with the size `n` and then reads the input values into it. We can optimize this by reading the values directly into the vector without initializing it first.

With these optimizations, the optimized program looks like this:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

int main() {
  int t;
  std::cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    int n;
    std::cin >> n;
    std::vector<int> ar(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
      std::cin >> ar[i];
    }
    std::vector<long long> dp(n + 1, 0);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
      dp[i + 1] = dp[i] + (i & 1 ? 0 : ar[i]);
      if (i + 2 <= n)
        dp[i + 2] = std::max(dp[i], dp[i + 1]) + ar[(i % 2 == 0 ? i + 1 : i)];
      dp[i + 1] = std::max({dp[i], dp[i + 1], dp[i + 2], dp[i + 1]}) +
                  (i & 1 ? 0 : ar[i]);
    }
    std::cout << std::max({dp[n], dp[n - 1], dp[n - 2]}) << std::endl;
  }
}
```

This optimized program removes unnecessary code and simplifies the data structures and loop conditions, resulting in improved running time and reduced memory usage.
