The given program reads an integer `n` and then reads `n` pairs of values `a` and `p`. It calculates the minimum value of `p` and multiplies it with `a`, and adds it to the sum. Finally, it prints the sum.

To optimize this program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary header file inclusion: The program includes `<bits/stdc++.h>` which is a non-standard header file and includes a lot of unnecessary headers. We can remove this line and only include the necessary headers.

2. Use `int` instead of `short` for `a` and `p`: The variables `a` and `p` are currently declared as `short`, but there is no apparent reason for this. We can change their type to `int` to avoid any potential overflow issues.

3. Use `int` instead of `long int` for `sum`: The variable `sum` is currently declared as `long int`, which may not be necessary. Since `a` and `p` are both of type `int`, the product `a * m` will also be of type `int`. Therefore, we can change the type of `sum` to `int` to save memory.

4. Use a more appropriate initial value for `m`: The variable `m` is initialized to `101`, which is the maximum possible value for `p` according to the problem statement. However, in the loop, `m` is updated as the minimum value of `p`, so we can initialize `m` to `INT_MAX` instead.

5. Use prefix decrement operator `--n` instead of post-decrement operator `n--`: The loop currently uses the post-decrement operator `n--`, which creates a temporary copy of `n` and then decrements `n`. Using the prefix decrement operator `--n` can avoid the creation of the temporary copy and potentially improve performance.

With these optimizations in mind, here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <climits>

int main() {
  int n;
  std::cin >> n;
  int a, p, m = INT_MAX;
  int sum = 0;
  while (--n >= 0) {
    std::cin >> a >> p;
    m = std::min(m, p);
    sum += a * m;
  }
  std::cout << sum;
  return 0;
}
```
