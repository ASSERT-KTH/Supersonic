Step 1: Remove unnecessary includes
The program includes the entire "bits/stdc++.h" library, which includes a lot of unnecessary headers. We can replace it with the specific headers needed for the program.

Step 2: Optimize variable initialization
The variable `m` is initialized to 101, which is the maximum possible value for `p`. Instead, we can initialize it to INT_MAX, which is more appropriate.

Step 3: Optimize loop condition
The original program uses a while loop with a decrementing variable `n`. Instead, we can use a for loop with an incrementing variable `i` to improve readability and maintainability.

Step 4: Optimize variable scoping
The variables `a`, `p`, and `m` are only used inside the loop, so we can move their declaration inside the loop to limit their scope.

Step 5: Optimize variable types
The variable `sum` is declared as a `long int`, which is unnecessarily large for the task. We can change its type to `int` to save memory.

Step 6: Optimize comparison operation
The comparison `m > p` is performed repeatedly inside the loop, which can be costly. Instead, we can use a ternary operator to update the value of `m` more efficiently.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <climits>

int main() {
  int n;
  std::cin >> n;
  int sum = 0;

  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    short a, p;
    std::cin >> a >> p;
    int m = INT_MAX;
    m = (m > p) ? p : m;
    sum += a * m;
  }

  std::cout << sum;
  return 0;
}
```
