Explanation of the optimization steps:

1. Remove unnecessary header inclusion: The original program includes the `bits/stdc++.h` header, which is not necessary for this program. We can remove it to improve compile time and reduce unnecessary overhead.

2. Use `int` instead of `short` for variables `a` and `p`: The original program uses `short` data type for variables `a` and `p`, which may result in unnecessary type conversions. We can change these variables to `int` to improve performance.

3. Remove unnecessary variable initialization: The variable `m` is initialized to 101, which is not necessary. We can remove this initialization since the program correctly updates the value of `m` based on the input.

4. Use prefix decrement operator in the while loop: The original program uses the postfix decrement operator (`n--`) in the while loop condition. However, the prefix decrement operator (`--n`) can be used to achieve the same result. This can improve performance by avoiding unnecessary copying of the value of `n`.

5. Optimize the calculation of `sum` using multiplication and addition: The original program calculates `sum += a * m` for each iteration of the loop. Instead of performing multiplication and addition separately, we can optimize this calculation by performing the multiplication first and then adding the result to `sum`.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  int n;
  std::cin >> n;
  int a, p, m;
  long long sum = 0;
  std::cin >> a >> p;
  m = p;
  sum += static_cast<long long>(a) * m;
  while (--n) {
    std::cin >> a >> p;
    m = std::min(m, p);
    sum += static_cast<long long>(a) * m;
  }
  std::cout << sum;
  return 0;
}
```
