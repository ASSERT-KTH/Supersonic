Explanation of optimization steps:

1. Remove unnecessary header inclusion: The program includes the `bits/stdc++.h` header, which is not necessary and can slow down compilation. We can remove it since we only need the `iostream` header for input/output operations.

2. Replace `short` with `int`: The variables `a` and `p` are declared as `short` integers. However, there is no need for them to be `short` as it does not provide any advantage in terms of memory usage or performance. We can replace them with regular `int` variables.

3. Remove unnecessary variable initialization: The variable `m` is initialized with a value of `101`, but it is immediately updated in the while loop. We can remove the initialization and update it inside the loop.

4. Use prefix increment operator: The loop condition `n--` uses the postfix decrement operator. However, the prefix increment operator `--n` is more efficient as it does not involve creating a temporary copy of the variable.

5. Use compound assignment operators: The statements `m = m > p ? p : m` and `sum += a * m` can be simplified using compound assignment operators. Instead of assigning and comparing separately, we can use the compound assignment operators `m = min(m, p)` and `sum += a * m` respectively.

6. Optimize input/output operations: The program uses `cin` for input and `cout` for output, which can be slow for large inputs. We can improve performance by using `scanf` for input and `printf` for output.

Optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int n;
  scanf("%d", &n);
  int a, p, m;
  long long int sum = 0;
  while (--n >= 0) {
    scanf("%d %d", &a, &p);
    m = (m > p) ? p : m;
    sum += a * m;
  }
  printf("%lld", sum);
  return 0;
}
```
