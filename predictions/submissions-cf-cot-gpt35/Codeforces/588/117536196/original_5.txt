Step 1: Remove unnecessary header file
The program includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header file, which is not necessary and can be removed.

Step 2: Optimize variable types
The variables `a`, `p`, and `m` are declared as `short` and `long int` respectively. Since the problem statement does not specify any constraints on the size of these variables, we can safely change their types to `int` to optimize memory usage.

Step 3: Optimize loop condition
The loop condition `while (n--)` can be optimized by changing it to `for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)`. This eliminates the need to decrement `n` in each iteration.

Step 4: Use a more efficient comparison operator
The line `m = m > p ? p : m;` can be optimized by using the `min` function instead of the conditional operator. This simplifies the code and improves readability.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  int a, p, m = 101;
  long long sum = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> a >> p;
    m = min(m, p);
    sum += a * m;
  }
  cout << sum;
  return 0;
}
```
