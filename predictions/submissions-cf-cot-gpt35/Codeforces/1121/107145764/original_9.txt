This program aims to find the sum of two elements in an array that occurs most frequently. The current implementation uses a nested loop to calculate the sum of all possible pairs and stores the frequencies of each sum in a map. Then, it iterates over the map to find the sum with the highest frequency.

To optimize this program, we can eliminate the need for the map and the nested loop. Instead, we can use an unordered map to store the frequencies of each element in the array. Then, we iterate over the array and for each element, we calculate the sum with all previous elements and update the frequency of the corresponding sum in the unordered map. Finally, we find the sum with the highest frequency in the unordered map.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(0);
  cout.tie(0);
  
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  
  vector<int> v(n);
  unordered_map<int, int> mp;
  
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> v[i];
    for (int j = 0; j < i; j++) {
      int sum = v[i] + v[j];
      mp[sum]++;
    }
  }
  
  int maxFreq = 0;
  for (auto it = mp.begin(); it != mp.end(); ++it) {
    maxFreq = max(maxFreq, it->second);
  }
  
  cout << maxFreq << endl;
}
```
This optimized program eliminates the need for the nested loop and uses an unordered map instead of a map. It calculates the sum of each pair of elements only once and updates the frequency in the unordered map. Finally, it finds the sum with the highest frequency by iterating over the unordered map and keeping track of the maximum frequency encountered.
