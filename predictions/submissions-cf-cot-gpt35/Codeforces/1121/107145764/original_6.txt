To optimize the given program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary library inclusion: The `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` includes a large number of standard library headers, which can impact compilation time and memory usage. Since we only need a few specific headers (`<iostream>`, `<vector>`, and `<map>`), we can include them individually instead.

2. Remove unnecessary synchronization: The lines `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);`, `cin.tie(0);`, and `cout.tie(0);` are used to synchronize the input and output streams with the standard C I/O streams. However, this synchronization is not necessary in this program as we are only using `cin` and `cout` for input and output. We can remove these lines to improve program performance.

3. Use reserve() function for vector: The vector `v` is used to store the input values. By using the `reserve()` function before the loop, we can allocate the required memory in advance. This can prevent unnecessary reallocations and improve the program's memory usage and execution time.

4. Use unordered_map instead of map: The map `mp` is used to store the sum of all pairs of elements from the input vector `v`. Since the order of the sums does not matter, we can use an unordered_map instead of a map to improve the program's performance. The unordered_map provides constant-time average complexity for insertion and retrieval operations.

5. Use auto for iterator: Instead of explicitly specifying the iterator type as `map<int, int>::iterator` in the loop, we can use the `auto` keyword to automatically infer the iterator type. This can simplify the code and make it more readable.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>

int main() {
  int n, z = 0, c = 0;
  std::cin >> n;
  std::vector<int> v;
  v.reserve(n);
  std::unordered_map<int, int> mp;

  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    int x;
    std::cin >> x;
    v.push_back(x);
  }

  for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
    for (int j = i + 1; j < n; j++) {
      long long x = v[i] + v[j];
      mp[x]++;
    }
  }

  for (auto it = mp.cbegin(); it != mp.cend(); ++it) {
    if (it->second > c) {
      z = it->first;
      c = it->second;
    }
  }

  std::cout << c << std::endl;
}
```
