Step 1: Remove unnecessary headers
- The `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` header includes a lot of unnecessary headers and can slow down compilation. We can replace it with the specific headers we need.

Step 2: Remove unnecessary using statements
- The `using namespace std;` statement imports the entire `std` namespace, which may cause naming conflicts and increase compilation time. We can remove this statement and use the `std::` prefix for specific standard library functions and classes.

Step 3: Remove unnecessary synchronization
- The `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);`, `cin.tie(0);`, and `cout.tie(0);` statements are used for synchronization with C I/O functions, but they are not necessary for this program. We can remove them.

Step 4: Use `reserve` for vector capacity
- The vector `v` is resized inside the loop, which can cause frequent reallocations and decrease performance. We can use the `reserve` function to allocate memory for the vector before the loop, based on the value of `n`.

Step 5: Use `unordered_map` instead of `map`
- The `map` data structure has a higher time complexity for insertion and retrieval compared to the `unordered_map`. Since the order of elements is not important in this program, we can use `unordered_map` instead.

Step 6: Simplify the loop condition
- The second loop can be simplified by changing the condition from `i < n - 1` to `i < n`.

Step 7: Use range-based for loop
- Instead of using iterators to iterate over the `mp` map, we can use a range-based for loop for simplicity and readability.

Step 8: Remove unnecessary output
- The program only needs to print the value of `c`, so we can remove the line `cout << c << endl;`.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>

int main() {
  int n;
  std::cin >> n;
  
  std::vector<int> v;
  v.reserve(n);
  
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    int x;
    std::cin >> x;
    v.push_back(x);
  }
  
  std::unordered_map<int, int> mp;
  
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    for (int j = i + 1; j < n; j++) {
      long long x = v[i] + v[j];
      mp[x]++;
    }
  }
  
  int z = 0, c = 0;
  
  for (const auto& p: mp) {
    if (p.second > c) {
      z = p.first;
      c = p.second;
    }
  }
  
  std::cout << c << std::endl;
}
```

By making these optimizations, we have improved the program's runtime and reduced its memory usage.
