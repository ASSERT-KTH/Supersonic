1. Remove unnecessary headers: The `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` header includes a large number of standard library headers, which can lead to slower compilation times. We can replace it with the specific headers we need, which in this case are `<iostream>`, `<vector>`, and `<map>`.

2. Avoid using `using namespace std;`: While it may seem convenient, it is generally considered bad practice to use the `using namespace std;` directive as it can lead to naming conflicts. Instead, we can prefix the standard library classes and functions with `std::` to specify the namespace.

3. Optimize input/output: The lines `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);`, `cin.tie(0);`, and `cout.tie(0);` are used to improve the input/output performance when synchronizing with C I/O. However, in this program, they are not necessary and can be removed.

4. Use reserve() for vector: The `vector` `v` is dynamically resized using `push_back()` inside the for loop. This can lead to multiple reallocations and cause unnecessary memory overhead. We can improve this by using `v.reserve(n)` before the loop to preallocate memory for `n` elements.

5. Use auto& in range-based loop: Instead of using `auto it = mp.cbegin(); it != mp.cend(); ++it`, we can use `auto& [key, value]` in the range-based loop to directly access the key-value pairs of the map.

6. Use unordered_map instead of map: Since we only need to count the frequency of sums, we can use an `unordered_map` instead of a `map`. The `unordered_map` provides faster average lookup and insertion times compared to the `map`.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>

int main() {
  int n, z = 0, c = 0;
  std::cin >> n;
  std::vector<int> v;
  v.reserve(n);
  std::unordered_map<int, int> mp;
  
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    int x;
    std::cin >> x;
    v.push_back(x);
  }
  
  for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
    for (int j = i + 1; j < n; j++) {
      long long x = v[i] + v[j];
      mp[x]++;
    }
  }
  
  for (auto& [key, value] : mp) {
    if (value > c) {
      z = key;
      c = value;
    }
  }
  
  std::cout << c << std::endl;
}
```
