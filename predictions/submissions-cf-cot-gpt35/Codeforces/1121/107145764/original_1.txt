Step 1: Remove unnecessary imports
The `bits/stdc++.h` library includes a large number of standard C++ libraries, which can negatively impact both the compilation time and the memory usage. Instead, we should only include the necessary libraries for the program.

Step 2: Optimize input/output operations
The `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false)` line is used to disable the synchronization between C and C++ standard streams, which can improve the execution time. However, it is not necessary in this program since we are not mixing C and C++ input/output operations.

Step 3: Optimize loop conditions
The second loop `for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++)` can be modified to `for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)` because the second loop only depends on `i` and not `n`. This change will not affect the output of the program but will make it slightly more efficient.

Step 4: Optimize variable initialization
The variable `z` is initialized to 0 and is only used to store the key with the maximum value in the map. We can remove the initialization statement and only initialize it when a new maximum value is found.

Step 5: Optimize map iteration
The map iteration can be optimized by using the range-based for loop instead of the iterator. This change simplifies the code and makes it more readable.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <map>

int main() {
  int n;
  std::cin >> n;

  std::vector<int> v(n);
  std::map<int, int> mp;

  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    std::cin >> v[i];
  }

  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    for (int j = i + 1; j < n; j++) {
      long long x = v[i] + v[j];
      mp[x]++;
    }
  }

  int z, c = 0;
  for (auto& p : mp) {
    if (p.second > c) {
      z = p.first;
      c = p.second;
    }
  }

  std::cout << c << std::endl;

  return 0;
}
```
