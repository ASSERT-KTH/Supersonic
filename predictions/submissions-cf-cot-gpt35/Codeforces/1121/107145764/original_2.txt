Optimization steps:

1. Remove unnecessary headers: The program includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header, which is not necessary and can be replaced with the specific headers needed.

2. Remove unnecessary I/O optimizations: The lines `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);`, `cin.tie(0);`, and `cout.tie(0);` can be removed as they are not needed for this program.

3. Avoid using `vector` for input storage: Instead of using a `vector<int> v` to store the input values, we can directly process them as they are read, which eliminates the need for an additional vector and reduces memory usage.

4. Use `unordered_map` instead of `map`: Since the order of elements doesn't matter in the final result, we can use an `unordered_map` instead of a `map`. This will provide faster insertion and lookup times, improving the overall runtime of the program.

5. Avoid using iterators for iteration: Instead of using iterators to iterate over the elements of the `unordered_map`, we can use a range-based for loop to simplify the code.

Optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>

int main() {
  int n, z = 0, c = 0;
  std::cin >> n;
  std::unordered_map<int, int> mp;

  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    int x;
    std::cin >> x;
    for (const auto& pair : mp) {
      int sum = pair.first + x;
      mp[sum]++;
      if (mp[sum] > c) {
        z = sum;
        c = mp[sum];
      }
    }
    mp[x]++;
    if (mp[x] > c) {
      z = x;
      c = mp[x];
    }
  }

  std::cout << c << std::endl;
  return 0;
}
```

Explanation:

1. The unnecessary headers `<bits/stdc++.h>` are removed. We only include the necessary headers `<iostream>` and `<unordered_map>`.

2. The I/O optimization lines are removed as they are not necessary for this program.

3. Instead of storing the input values in a `vector<int> v`, we directly process them as they are read. This eliminates the need for an additional vector and reduces memory usage.

4. The `map<int, int>` is replaced with `unordered_map<int, int>` for faster insertion and lookup times. The order of elements doesn't matter in the final result, so using an unordered map is more efficient.

5. The use of iterators is replaced with a range-based for loop to simplify the code and improve readability. We iterate over the elements of the `unordered_map` directly.

6. The program now calculates the sum of each pair of elements and updates the `unordered_map` accordingly. It also keeps track of the maximum count (`c`) and corresponding sum (`z`) as it iterates through the input values.

7. Finally, the maximum count (`c`) is printed as the output.
