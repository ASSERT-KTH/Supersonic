The given C/C++ program performs polynomial multiplication using the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm. The program first generates a list of prime numbers using the Sieve of Eratosthenes. It then reads input values for `n`, `x`, and `y`. It uses these input values to construct two polynomials `l` and `r` by counting the occurrences of each input value. It then multiplies the polynomials `l` and `r` using the `multiply` function. Finally, it reads input values for `q` and performs some calculations to determine the maximum value for each input value.

To optimize the program for running time and memory usage, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The program includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header, which is not standard and includes a large number of headers. We can remove this line and include only the necessary headers, such as `<iostream>`, `<vector>`, and `<cmath>`.

2. Remove unnecessary type definitions: The program defines `typedef long long ll` and `#define int ll`. These are not used in the program and can be removed.

3. Remove unnecessary macros: The program defines several macros, such as `db`, `fore`, `FIN`, `SZ`, `ALL`, `mset`, `pb`, `fst`, and `snd`. These macros are not used in the program and can be removed.

4. Replace `vector<int>` with `array<int, MAXN>`: The program uses a vector `pr` to store prime numbers. Since the maximum number of prime numbers is known (`MAXN`), we can replace `vector<int>` with `array<int, MAXN>` for better memory usage.

5. Replace `vector<ll>` with `array<ll, MAXN>`: The program uses a vector `r` to store divisors. Since the maximum number of divisors is known (`MAXN`), we can replace `vector<ll>` with `array<ll, MAXN>` for better memory usage.

6. Replace `vector<pair<ll, int>>` with `array<pair<ll, int>, MAXN>`: The program uses a vector `f` to store factorizations. Since the maximum number of factorizations is known (`MAXN`), we can replace `vector<pair<ll, int>>` with `array<pair<ll, int>, MAXN>` for better memory usage.

7. Replace `vector<tf>` with `array<tf, MAXN>`: The program uses a vector `poly` to store polynomials. Since the maximum size of polynomials is known (`2 * OFFSET + 1`), we can replace `vector<tf>` with `array<tf, 2 * OFFSET + 1>` for better memory usage.

8. Replace `poly res` with `array<int, q>`: The program uses a vector `res` to store results. Since the size of `res` is known (`q`), we can replace `poly res` with `array<int, q>` for better memory usage.

9. Remove unused variables: The program defines variables `n`, `x`, `y`, `lp`, `can`, and `pr`, but they are not used in the program. We can remove these variables to improve memory usage.

10. Replace `mt19937` with `default_random_engine`: The program uses `mt19937` random number generator, but it is not necessary for the given code. We can replace it with `default_random_engine` for simplicity.

11. Replace `chrono::steady_clock` with `system_clock`: The program uses `chrono::steady_clock` to get the current time for seeding the random number generator. We can replace it with `system_clock` for simplicity.

12. Remove unnecessary `memset`: The program uses `memset` to initialize the `res` array to -1. Since we are replacing `poly res` with `array<int, q>`, which automatically initializes elements to 0, we can remove the `memset` call.
