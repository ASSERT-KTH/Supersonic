Optimization Step 1: Remove unnecessary headers

The program includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header, which includes all the standard headers in C++. However, this header is not recommended for use in production code as it increases compilation time. Since the program does not use all the standard headers, we can remove this line and include only the necessary headers.

Optimization Step 2: Remove unnecessary typedefs

The program uses `typedef` to define `ll` as `long long` and `int` as `ll`. However, these typedefs are not necessary and can be removed.

Optimization Step 3: Remove unnecessary macros

The program defines several macros that are not used. We can remove these macros to simplify the code.

Optimization Step 4: Replace `vector` with `array` for fixed-size vectors

The program uses `vector` to store the prime numbers and the result. However, the size of these vectors is fixed and known at compile-time. We can replace these vectors with `array` to reduce memory usage and improve performance.

Optimization Step 5: Replace `vector` with `bitset` for boolean array

The program uses a `vector` called `can` to store boolean values. Since the size of this array is fixed, we can replace it with a `bitset` to reduce memory usage and improve performance.

Optimization Step 6: Use a constant variable instead of a macro for `MAXN`

The program defines a macro `MAXN` to represent the maximum value of `N`. We can replace this macro with a constant variable to improve readability and maintainability.

Optimization Step 7: Combine multiple variable declarations into a single line

The program declares multiple variables on separate lines. We can combine these variable declarations into a single line to improve code readability.

Optimization Step 8: Remove unnecessary function parameters

The program defines a function `div_rec` that takes two parameters `vector<ll> &r` and `vector<pair<ll, int>> &f`. However, these parameters are not used within the function. We can remove these parameters to simplify the code.

Optimization Step 9: Use `constexpr` instead of `const` for constant variables

The program defines a constant variable `pi` using the `const` keyword. We can use the `constexpr` keyword instead to indicate that the value of `pi` is a compile-time constant.

Optimization Step 10: Use `array` instead of `poly` for fixed-size arrays

The program uses a `vector` called `poly` to store polynomial coefficients. However, the size of this vector is fixed and known at compile-time. We can replace this `vector` with `array` to reduce memory usage and improve performance.

Optimization Step 11: Remove unused function `multiply`

The program defines a function called `multiply` that multiplies two polynomials. However, this function is not used in the program. We can remove this function to simplify the code.

Optimization Step 12: Use `unordered_map` instead of `vector` for `g`

The program uses a `vector` called `g` to store divisors of X. However, the program only checks if `g[X]` is empty or not. We can replace this `vector` with an `unordered_map` to reduce memory usage and improve performance.

Optimization Step 13: Use `unordered_set` instead of `vector` for `pr`

The program uses a `vector` called `pr` to store prime numbers. However, the program only checks if a number is in `pr` or not. We can replace this `vector` with an `unordered_set` to reduce memory usage and improve performance.

Optimization Step 14: Use range-based `for` loop instead of index-based `for` loop

The program uses index-based `for` loops to iterate over vectors. We can use range-based `for` loops to simplify the code and improve readability.

Optimization Step 15: Use `auto` keyword for type deduction

The program explicitly specifies the types of variables in some cases. We can use the `auto` keyword for type deduction to simplify the code and improve readability.

Optimization Step 16: Use `endl` instead of `"\n"` for newline

The program uses `"\n"` to represent a newline character. We can use `endl` instead to ensure that the output is flushed after each line.

Optimization Step 17: Remove unnecessary code

The program contains some unnecessary code that can be removed to simplify the code and improve performance.

Here is the optimized C++ program:

```cpp

            lp[i * p] = p;

        return;
