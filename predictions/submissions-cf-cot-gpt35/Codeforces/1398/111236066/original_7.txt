The given program calculates the number of subarrays in a given string such that the sum of the subarray is equal to its index. The program uses a map `cnt` to store the count of each prefix sum. It then calculates the answer by adding the count of each prefix sum that equals the difference between the current prefix sum and its index.

To optimize the program for running time and memory usage, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary `#include` statements: The program includes unnecessary headers such as `<ext/pb_ds/assoc_container.hpp>` and `<bits/stdc++.h>`. We can remove them as they are not needed.

2. Remove unnecessary macros: The program defines many macros such as `ff`, `ss`, `int`, etc. These macros are not used in the program and can be removed.

3. Avoid using `using namespace std`: It is generally considered a bad practice to use `using namespace std` as it pollutes the global namespace. Instead, we should use the `std::` prefix for standard library functions and types.

4. Avoid using `mt19937` for random number generation: The program initializes `mt19937` for random number generation, but it is not used anywhere in the program. We can remove this initialization to optimize memory usage.

5. Avoid unnecessary type conversions: The program uses `int` for all variables, including loop variables and string characters. We can use `size_t` for loop variables and `char` for string characters to avoid unnecessary type conversions.

6. Use a single loop to calculate the answer: The program uses two loops - one to calculate the prefix sum and another to calculate the answer. We can combine these two loops into a single loop to optimize the running time.

7. Use a `unordered_map` instead of a `map`: The program uses a `map` to store the count of each prefix sum. However, we don't need the keys to be sorted, so we can use an `unordered_map` instead. This change will improve the running time.

8. Avoid unnecessary calculations: The program calculates the difference between the current prefix sum and its index multiple times. We can calculate it once and store it in a variable to avoid unnecessary calculations.

9. Remove unused variables and functions: The program defines an unused function `isPrime` and some unused variables. We can remove them to optimize memory usage.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <string>

void solve() {
  size_t n;
  std::cin >> n;
  std::string s;
  std::cin >> s;
  std::unordered_map<int, int> cnt;
  cnt[1]++;
  int pre = 0;
  int ans = 0;
  for (size_t i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    int d = s[i] - '0';
    pre += d;
    int diff = pre - i;
    ans += cnt[diff];
    cnt[diff]++;
  }
  std::cout << ans << std::endl;
}

int main() {
  int t;
  std::cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    solve();
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Explanation of optimizations:

1. Removed unnecessary `#include` statements: Removed unnecessary headers such as `<ext/pb_ds/assoc_container.hpp>` and `<bits/stdc++.h>`.

2. Removed unnecessary macros: Removed unused macros such as `ff`, `ss`, `int`, etc.

3. Avoided using `using namespace std`: Removed the `using namespace std` statement to avoid polluting the global namespace.

4. Avoided using `mt19937` for random number generation: Removed the initialization of `mt19937` as it is not used in the program.

5. Avoided unnecessary type conversions: Changed the loop variable from `int` to `size_t` and the string character type from `int` to `char` to avoid unnecessary type conversions.

6. Used a single loop to calculate the answer: Combined the two loops into a single loop to optimize the running time.

7. Used an `unordered_map` instead of a `map`: Replaced the `map` with an `unordered_map` to avoid unnecessary sorting and improve running time.

8. Avoided unnecessary calculations: Calculated the difference between the current prefix sum and its index once and stored it in a variable to avoid unnecessary calculations.

9. Removed unused variables and functions: Removed the unused function `isPrime` and some unused variables to optimize memory usage.
