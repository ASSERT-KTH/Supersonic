The given program calculates the number of subarrays in a given string such that the sum of the elements in the subarray is equal to the difference in their indices.

Here are the optimization steps:

1. Remove unnecessary header files: The program includes `<bits/stdc++.h>` and `<ext/pb_ds/assoc_container.hpp>` which are not required for this specific program. We can remove these include statements.

2. Remove unused macros: The program defines several macros that are not used in the code. We can remove these macro definitions to simplify the code.

3. Replace `int long long` with `int`: The program uses `int long long` as the data type for integers. However, for this specific program, using `int` is sufficient and will save memory.

4. Remove unused typedef: The program typedefs `tree<int, null_type, less<int>, rb_tree_tag, tree_order_statistics_node_update>` as `pbds`, but it is not used anywhere in the code. We can remove this typedef.

5. Remove unused functions: The program defines a `isPrime` function, but it is not used in the code. We can remove this function to simplify the code.

6. Optimize the loop condition: The loop condition in the `solve` function is `i < n`, where `n` is the length of the string. However, we can optimize it to `i < n-1` since we are accessing `s[i+1]` inside the loop. This will reduce unnecessary iterations.

7. Optimize the map access: Inside the loop, the program accesses the `cnt` map multiple times. We can optimize this by storing the result of `cnt[pre - i]` in a variable before using it in the calculation. This will avoid multiple map lookups.

8. Remove unnecessary increment: The program increments `cnt[1]` before the loop, but it is not used in the calculation. We can remove this increment statement.

9. Avoid using `endl`: The program uses `endl` to print a newline character, but it also flushes the output buffer. We can use `"\n"` instead of `endl` to avoid the unnecessary buffer flush.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <map>
using namespace std;

void solve() {
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  string s;
  cin >> s;
  map<int, int> cnt;
  int pre = 0;
  int ans = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < n-1; i++) {
    int d = s[i] - '0';
    pre += d;
    int diff = pre - i;
    ans += cnt[diff];
    cnt[diff]++;
  }
  cout << ans << "\n";
}

int main() {
  int t;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    solve();
  }
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized program removes unnecessary code and makes small modifications to improve the running time and memory usage.
