The given program can be optimized by removing unnecessary code and data structures.

1. Remove unnecessary headers: The program includes `<bits/stdc++.h>` and `<ext/pb_ds/assoc_container.hpp>` headers, which are not needed for this program.

2. Remove unnecessary macros: The program defines several macros that are not used. We can remove these macros to simplify the code.

3. Remove unnecessary typedefs: The program defines `typedef tree<int, null_type, less<int>, rb_tree_tag, tree_order_statistics_node_update> pbds`, but it is not used. We can remove this typedef.

4. Optimize the `isPrime` function: The `isPrime` function is not used in the given program. We can remove this function.

5. Optimize the `solve` function: The `solve` function can be optimized by removing the `mii cnt` map and using a single integer variable to keep track of the count. We can initialize this variable to 1 and update it inside the loop. This eliminates the need for the map and reduces memory usage.

Based on the above optimizations, the optimized C++ program is as follows:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

void solve() {
    int n;
    cin >> n;
    string s;
    cin >> s;
    int cnt = 1;
    int pre = 0;
    int ans = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        int d = s[i] - '0';
        pre += d;
        ans += cnt - i;
        cnt++;
    }
    cout << ans << endl;
}

int main() {
    int t;
    cin >> t;
    while (t--) {
        solve();
    }
    return 0;
}
```

This optimized program reduces memory usage by removing unnecessary data structures and simplifies the code by removing unused macros and typedefs.
