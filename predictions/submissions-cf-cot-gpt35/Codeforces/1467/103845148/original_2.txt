The given code is a program that calculates the number of "mountain points" in an array. A mountain point is defined as an element in the array that is either greater than its neighboring elements or smaller than its neighboring elements.

Below are the optimization steps for the given code:

1. Remove unnecessary header files: The `<bits\stdc++.h>` header file includes a large number of other header files, which can slow down the compilation process. We can remove this line and include only the necessary header files.

2. Remove unnecessary macros: The `#define` macros for `ll`, `vi`, `vb`, `ff`, `ss`, and `pb` are not used in the code. We can remove these macros.

3. Change `vector<int>` to `vector<ll>`: The vector `a` is used to store the array elements. Since the array elements are of type `ll` (long long), we can change the vector type to `vector<ll>` to avoid implicit type conversion.

4. Change `kitne()` function to use `int` instead of `ll`: The `kitne()` function takes an `ll` parameter `ind` and returns an `int` value. Since the `ind` parameter is not used outside the function, we can change its type to `int` to avoid unnecessary type conversion.

5. Avoid unnecessary calculations in `kitne()` function: The `kitne()` function checks three elements in the array for each index `ind`. Instead, we can check only two elements, i.e., `a[ind]` and `a[ind+1]`, by changing the loop condition to `for (ll i = ind; i <= ind + 1; i++)`. This will reduce the number of iterations and improve the running time.

6. Change `hn_bhai()` function to use `int` instead of `ll`: The `hn_bhai()` function takes input and performs calculations using `ll` variables `n`, `i`, and `tot`. Since these variables are used only within the function and their values are within the range of `int`, we can change their types to `int` to save memory.

7. Avoid unnecessary calculations in `hn_bhai()` function: The `hn_bhai()` function calculates the initial value of `tot` by iterating over the array. Instead, we can calculate it by calling `kitne()` function for index `0` and index `n-1` and adding the results. This will eliminate the need for the first loop and improve the running time.

8. Avoid unnecessary assignments in the second loop of `hn_bhai()` function: Inside the second loop, the variable `temp` is assigned the result of `kitne(i)`, and then `a[i]` is modified twice. However, these modifications are unnecessary since the values are restored back to their original values before the loop ends. We can remove these assignments to improve the running time and reduce memory usage.

9. Use `reserve()` instead of `resize()` for `vector a`: Instead of resizing the vector `a` to size `n`, we can use `reserve()` to allocate memory for `n` elements without initializing them. This will improve the memory usage by avoiding unnecessary initialization.

10. Use `cout` with `'\n'` instead of `endl`: The `endl` manipulator flushes the output stream, which can be slower compared to using `'\n'` to insert a newline character. We can replace `endl` with `'\n'` to improve the running time.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

typedef long long ll;

vector<ll> a;

int kitne(int ind) {
  int cnt = 0;
  ll n = a.size();
  for (int i = ind; i <= ind + 1; i++) {
    if (i - 1 >= 0 && i + 1 < n) {
      if ((a[i] > a[i + 1] && a[i] > a[i - 1]) ||
          (a[i] < a[i - 1] && a[i] < a[i + 1]))
        cnt++;
    }
  }
  return cnt;
}

void hn_bhai() {
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  a.reserve(n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    cin >> a[i];
  int tot = kitne(0) + kitne(n - 1);
  int p = 0;
  for (int i = 1; i < n - 1; i++) {
    p = max(p, kitne(i) - kitne(i - 1));
    p = max(p, kitne(i) - kitne(i + 1));
  }
  cout << tot - p << '\n';
}

int main() {
  int t;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--)
    hn_bhai();
  return 0;
}
```

By following these optimization steps, we have improved both the running time and memory usage of the given code.
