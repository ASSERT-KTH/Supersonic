Step 1: Removing unnecessary header file inclusion:
The `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` header file includes a lot of other header files, which may not be necessary for this program. We can remove this line and manually include the necessary header files.

Step 2: Removing unnecessary macros:
The `fast` macro is not necessary for this program. It disables synchronization between C and C++ standard streams, which may not be required. We can remove this macro.

Step 3: Optimizing vector initialization:
The vector `a` is initialized with size `n + 1` but all elements are set to 0 by default. We can optimize this by initializing the vector with size `n + 1` and setting all elements to 0 explicitly.

Step 4: Removing unnecessary vector sorting:
The vector `a` is sorted using the `sort` function. However, the program only uses the cumulative sum of the elements in `a`. Sorting the vector is not necessary for this calculation. We can remove the sorting step.

Step 5: Optimizing cumulative sum calculation:
The cumulative sum calculation can be optimized by using a single loop instead of two separate loops. Instead of calculating the cumulative sum in two steps, we can calculate it in a single step while reading the input elements.

Step 6: Removing unnecessary variables:
The variable `x` is not necessary for the program. We can remove this variable.

Step 7: Improving output formatting:
The program prints the result of each query on a new line using `cout << endl;`. We can improve the output formatting by removing the extra `;` and using `"\n"` instead of `endl`.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

#define ll long long int

int main() {
  ll n;
  cin >> n;

  vector<ll> a(n + 1, 0);
  for (ll i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    cin >> a[i];
    a[i] += a[i - 1];
  }

  ll m;
  cin >> m;
  for (ll i = 0; i < m; i++) {
    ll x;
    cin >> x;
    cout << a[n] - a[n - x] << "\n";
  }

  return 0;
}
```
