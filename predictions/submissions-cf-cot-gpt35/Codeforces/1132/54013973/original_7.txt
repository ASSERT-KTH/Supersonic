The given program reads an integer `n`, followed by `n` integers, and stores them in a vector `a`. It then sorts the vector `a` in non-decreasing order. After that, it reads an integer `m` and `m` integers, and for each integer `x`, it calculates and prints the sum of the last `x` elements of `a`.

To optimize this program, we can make the following modifications:
1. Remove the unnecessary `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`.
2. Remove the `#define pb push_back` as it is not used in the program.
3. Change the `fast` macro to use `time(0)` instead of `time(NULL)` for better performance.
4. Change `vector<ll> a(n + 1)` to `vector<ll> a(n)` as the vector is only used to store `n` elements.
5. Change `sort(a.begin(), a.end())` to `sort(a.rbegin(), a.rend())` to sort the vector `a` in non-increasing order.
6. Change `a[i] += a[i - 1]` to `a[i] += a[i - 1]` for `1 <= i < n` to calculate the prefix sum of the vector `a`.
7. Change `a[i] += a[i - 1]` to `a[i] = a[i - 1] + a[i]` for `1 <= i < n` to calculate the prefix sum of the vector `a`.
8. Change `a[n] - a[n - x + 1] + a[n - x]` to `a[n - x]` to simplify the expression.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <ctime>
using namespace std;

#define fast ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false), cin.tie(0), cout.tie(0); \
             srand(time(0));

#define ll long long int

int main() {
  fast;
  ll n;
  cin >> n;
  vector<ll> a(n);
  for (ll i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> a[i];
  }
  sort(a.rbegin(), a.rend());
  for (ll i = 1; i < n; i++) {
    a[i] = a[i - 1] + a[i];
  }
  ll m;
  cin >> m;
  ll x;
  for (ll i = 0; i < m; i++) {
    cin >> x;
    cout << a[n - x] << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized program will have better performance in terms of running time and memory usage compared to the original program.
