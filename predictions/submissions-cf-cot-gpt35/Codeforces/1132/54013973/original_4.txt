Step 1: Remove unnecessary includes and using statements.
- The program includes `<bits/stdc++.h>` which is not necessary. This header includes a lot of other headers, which can slow down the compilation process. We can remove it and include only the necessary headers.
- The program is using `std` namespace which can lead to naming conflicts. It's better to remove the `using namespace std` statement and prefix the standard library types and functions with `std::`.

Step 2: Remove unnecessary macros.
- The program defines macros for `fast`, `ll`, and `pb` which are not necessary. We can remove them and use the actual code instead.

Step 3: Optimize the sorting algorithm.
- The program uses `std::sort` to sort the vector `a`. The default sorting algorithm used by `std::sort` is `introsort`, which has a worst-case time complexity of O(n log n). However, since the input size is not large, we can use a simpler sorting algorithm with a better average-case time complexity. We can replace `std::sort` with `std::stable_sort` which has a worst-case time complexity of O(n log n) but with better average-case performance. This change will improve the sorting time for most inputs.

Step 4: Optimize the cumulative sum calculation.
- The program calculates the cumulative sum of the vector `a` using a loop. We can optimize this calculation by using `std::partial_sum` which calculates the partial sums in a more efficient way.

Step 5: Optimize the query calculation.
- The program calculates `a[n] - a[n - x + 1] + a[n - x]` for each query. This can be simplified to `2 * a[n] - a[n - x + 1]` since `a[n - x]` is already included in `a[n]`. This change will reduce the number of additions in each query.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

int main() {
  std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  std::cin.tie(0);
  std::cout.tie(0);
  
  int n;
  std::cin >> n;
  std::vector<int> a(n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    std::cin >> a[i];
  }
  
  std::stable_sort(a.begin(), a.end());
  
  std::vector<int> prefixSum(n);
  std::partial_sum(a.begin(), a.end(), prefixSum.begin());
  
  int m;
  std::cin >> m;
  for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
    int x;
    std::cin >> x;
    std::cout << 2 * prefixSum[n - 1] - prefixSum[n - x] << std::endl;
  }
  
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized program makes small modifications to the original program to improve its running time and memory usage. The sorting algorithm is changed to `std::stable_sort` for better average-case performance. The cumulative sum calculation is optimized using `std::partial_sum`. The query calculation is simplified to reduce the number of additions.
