Step 1: Remove unnecessary includes and macros.

The program includes the entire "bits/stdc++.h" header, which is not recommended as it includes a large number of unnecessary headers. We can remove it and include only the necessary headers.

The macros "#define fast" and "#define ll" are also not necessary for optimization and can be removed.

Step 2: Use a more efficient algorithm for sorting.

The program uses the std::sort() function to sort the vector "a". We can replace it with a more efficient sorting algorithm, such as std::sort() or std::partial_sort().

Step 3: Optimize the loop for calculating prefix sums.

The loop for calculating the prefix sums can be optimized by removing the if condition inside the loop. Instead of adding a[i - 1] only if i is greater than 0, we can add it unconditionally. This will simplify the loop and improve performance.

Step 4: Optimize the loop for querying prefix sums.

The loop for querying the prefix sums can be optimized by calculating the result in a single expression. Instead of accessing a[n] and a[n - x + 1] separately, we can calculate the difference in a single expression.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

int main() {
    std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    std::cin.tie(0);
    std::cout.tie(0);
    
    int n;
    std::cin >> n;
    std::vector<long long> a(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        std::cin >> a[i];
    }
    std::sort(a.begin(), a.end());
    for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
        a[i] += a[i - 1];
    }
    
    int m;
    std::cin >> m;
    for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
        int x;
        std::cin >> x;
        std::cout << a[n - 1] - a[n - x - 1] << std::endl;
    }
    
    return 0;
}
```

Explanation:

1. Removed unnecessary includes and macros.
2. Used std::sort() to sort the vector "a".
3. Optimized the loop for calculating prefix sums by removing the unnecessary if condition.
4. Optimized the loop for querying prefix sums by calculating the result in a single expression.
