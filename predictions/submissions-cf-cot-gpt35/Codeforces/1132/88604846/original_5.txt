The given program calculates the minimum amount of time needed to perform a series of tasks. The tasks are represented by two arrays `a` and `b`. Array `a` represents the initial amount of work remaining for each task, and array `b` represents the amount of work that can be done in one unit of time for each task.

The program uses a binary search algorithm to find the minimum time. It starts with a lower bound `l` of 0 and an upper bound `r` of INF64 (a very large value). In each iteration of the binary search, it calculates the middle value `m` and uses the `check` function to determine if it is possible to complete all tasks within `m` units of time. If it is possible, it updates the upper bound `r` to `m`, otherwise it updates the lower bound `l` to `m`. The binary search continues until `l` and `r` are adjacent.

To optimize the program, I would make the following modifications:
1. Remove unnecessary includes: The program includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header, which is not necessary. We can remove it.
2. Remove unnecessary macros: The program uses the `forn` macro, which is a shortcut for a for loop. We can replace it with a regular for loop for better readability.
3. Replace `scanf` and `printf` with `cin` and `cout`: The program uses the `scanf` and `printf` functions for input and output. We can replace them with `cin` and `cout` for better performance and easier syntax.
4. Replace `vector` with a fixed-size array: The program uses a vector `qr` to store indices of tasks. Since the maximum size is known in advance, we can replace the vector with a fixed-size array for better memory usage.
5. Use `int` instead of `long long` for array `a`: The program uses a `long long` array `a` to store the initial amount of work remaining for each task. Since the values are within the range of an `int`, we can use an `int` array for better memory usage.
6. Replace `cur` array with a single variable `cur`: The program uses an array `cur` to store the remaining work for each task. We can replace it with a single variable `cur` since we only need to keep track of the current remaining work.
7. Optimize the `check` function: The `check` function can be optimized by removing unnecessary calculations and using a more efficient approach.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
const int N = 200 * 1000 + 13;
const int INF = 1e9;
int n, k;
int a[N];
int b[N];
int qr[N][N];
bool check(int x) {
  int cur = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    int t = (a[i] + b[i] - 1) / b[i];
    cur += t;
    if (cur > k) return false;
    if (cur == k) return true;
    qr[t][cur] = i;
  }
  int lst = 0;
  for (int t = 0; t < k; t++) {
    while (lst < k && qr[t][lst] == 0) {
      lst++;
    }
    if (lst <= t) return false;
    if (lst == k) return true;
    int i = qr[t][lst];
    a[i] -= b[i] * (k - t);
    qr[t + 1][lst] = i;
  }
  return true;
}
int main() {
  std::cin >> n >> k;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    std::cin >> a[i];
  }
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    std::cin >> b[i];
  }
  int l = 0, r = INF;
  while (l < r - 1) {
    int m = (l + r) / 2;
    if (check(m)) {
      r = m;
    } else {
      l = m;
    }
  }
  if (!check(r)) {
    std::cout << -1 << std::endl;
  } else {
    std::cout << (check(l) ? l : r) << std::endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```
