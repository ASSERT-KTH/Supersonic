To optimize the given program, we can use memoization to avoid redundant calculations. Currently, the program uses a 3D array `dp` to store the results of subproblems. However, this approach is not efficient because it requires a lot of memory.

Instead, we can use a `map` or `unordered_map` to store the results of subproblems dynamically. This will allow us to only calculate and store the results that are actually needed.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
#define int long long
#define endl '\n';
const int nmmx = 31, kmx = 51;
unordered_map<int, int> dp[nmmx][nmmx];
int solve(int n, int m, int k) {
  if (dp[n][m].count(k))
    return dp[n][m][k];
  if (n * m == k || !k)
    return dp[n][m][k] = 0;
  int ans = 1e18;
  for (int i = 1; i <= n - 1; ++i) {
    for (int j = 0; j <= k; ++j) {
      ans = min(ans, m * m + solve(i, m, j) + solve(n - i, m, k - j));
    }
  }
  for (int i = 1; i <= m - 1; ++i) {
    for (int j = 0; j <= k; ++j) {
      ans = min(ans, n * n + solve(n, i, j) + solve(n, m - i, k - j));
    }
  }
  return dp[n][m][k] = ans;
}
signed main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  cout.tie(NULL);
  int t;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    int n, m, k;
    cin >> n >> m >> k;
    cout << solve(n, m, k) << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```

In the optimized program, we have replaced the 3D array `dp` with an `unordered_map` `dp[n][m]` to store the results of subproblems dynamically. Each entry in the map `dp[n][m]` represents the result of `solve(n, m, k)` for a specific value of `k`.

Now, when calculating `solve(n, m, k)`, we can first check if the result is already present in `dp[n][m]` using the `count` function. If it is present, we can directly return the result. Otherwise, we calculate the result as before and store it in `dp[n][m]` for future use.

This optimization reduces the memory usage by only storing the results that are actually needed, instead of pre-allocating a large 3D array.
