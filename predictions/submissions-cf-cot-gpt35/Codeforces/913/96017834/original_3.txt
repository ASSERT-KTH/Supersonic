The given program is checking whether a given tree satisfies a specific condition or not. The tree is represented as an adjacency list, where each node is represented by its index and the list contains the indices of its children.

To optimize the program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Instead of using a `std::vector<std::vector<size_t>>` for the adjacency list, we can use a `std::vector<std::vector<unsigned>>`. This will reduce the memory usage because the indices can be represented by unsigned integers instead of size_t.

2. We can change the condition `k < 3` to `k <= 2` because if the count `k` is less than or equal to 2, the condition is not satisfied. This will not affect the correctness of the program.

3. We can remove the unnecessary check for `g[i].empty()` inside the loop because the adjacency list is guaranteed to be non-empty for each node.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

void answer(bool v) {
  constexpr const char *s[2] = {"No", "Yes"};
  std::cout << s[v] << '\n';
}

void solve(const std::vector<std::vector<unsigned>> &g) {
  const unsigned n = g.size();
  for (unsigned i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    unsigned k = 0;
    for (const unsigned x : g[i])
      k += g[x].empty();
    if (k <= 2)
      return answer(false);
  }
  answer(true);
}

int main() {
  unsigned n;
  std::cin >> n;
  std::vector<std::vector<unsigned>> g(n);
  for (unsigned i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
    unsigned p;
    std::cin >> p;
    g[p - 1].push_back(i);
  }
  solve(g);
  return 0;
}
```

With these modifications, the program should have improved running time and reduced memory usage.
