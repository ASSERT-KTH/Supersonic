The given program calculates whether a given tree is a valid binary tree or not. The tree is represented as an adjacency list where each node is connected to its parent.

To optimize the program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove the unnecessary check for `g[i].empty()` inside the inner loop. Since `g[i]` is a vector of size_t, it will never be empty.

2. Instead of calculating the sum of empty children nodes in each iteration of the inner loop, we can calculate it once before the loop and update it incrementally inside the loop.

3. Instead of using an unsigned integer `k` to count the number of empty children nodes, we can use a boolean variable `hasEmptyChild` which will be set to true if any child of `x` is empty.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

void answer(bool v) {
  constexpr const char *s[2] = {"No", "Yes"};
  std::cout << s[v] << '\n';
}

void solve(const std::vector<std::vector<size_t>> &g) {
  const size_t n = g.size();
  for (size_t i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    if (g[i].empty())
      continue;
    bool hasEmptyChild = false;
    for (const size_t x : g[i]) {
      hasEmptyChild |= g[x].empty();
    }
    if (!hasEmptyChild)
      return answer(false);
  }
  answer(true);
}

int main() {
  size_t n;
  std::cin >> n;
  std::vector<std::vector<size_t>> g(n);
  for (size_t i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
    unsigned p;
    std::cin >> p;
    g[p - 1].push_back(i);
  }
  solve(g);
  return 0;
}
```

By making these optimizations, we have reduced the number of unnecessary operations and improved the efficiency of the program.
