The given program is a C++ program that takes an input and checks whether a given graph satisfies a certain condition. The program reads an integer `n` from the input, which represents the number of nodes in the graph. Then, it reads `n-1` integers from the input and constructs the graph accordingly. Finally, it calls the `solve` function to check if the graph satisfies the condition.

To optimize this program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove the unnecessary `answer` function: The `answer` function is used to print the result, but it can be replaced with a simple `std::cout` statement. This will eliminate the need for the `answer` function and reduce the function call overhead.

2. Use `reserve` to allocate memory for the vector: The `g` vector is dynamically resized when inserting elements. By using the `reserve` function before inserting elements, we can allocate the memory beforehand and avoid reallocations during the insertion.

3. Replace the inner loop with a count algorithm: The inner loop in the `solve` function is used to count the number of empty vectors in `g`. Instead of iterating over the elements and checking if they are empty, we can use the `std::count_if` algorithm to count the number of empty vectors directly.

4. Break early if the condition is not satisfied: In the `solve` function, if the condition `k < 3` is not satisfied for any node, we can immediately return `false` and exit the function. This will avoid unnecessary iterations and improve the overall running time.

Here is the optimized C++ program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

int main() {
  size_t n;
  std::cin >> n;
  
  std::vector<std::vector<size_t>> g;
  g.reserve(n);
  
  for (size_t i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
    unsigned p;
    std::cin >> p;
    g[p - 1].push_back(i);
  }
  
  for (size_t i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    if (g[i].empty())
      continue;
      
    unsigned k = std::count_if(g[i].begin(), g[i].end(), [&](size_t x) {
      return g[x].empty();
    });
    
    if (k < 3) {
      std::cout << "No" << '\n';
      return 0;
    }
  }
  
  std::cout << "Yes" << '\n';
  return 0;
}
```

By making these optimizations, we have reduced the function call overhead, avoided unnecessary reallocations, and improved the overall running time of the program.
