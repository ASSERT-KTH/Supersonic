Step 1: Reduce unnecessary memory usage
- The program uses a 2D vector `g` to represent a graph. However, we can optimize the memory usage by using a 1D vector and storing the parent index instead of child indices. This way, we can save memory by avoiding the creation of multiple vector objects for each child.
- We can also remove the `n` variable as it is redundant. The size of the vector `g` will represent the value of `n`.

Step 2: Optimize the nested loop
- The nested loop in the `solve` function iterates over each element in `g[i]` and checks if `g[x]` is empty for each `x` in `g[i]`. This results in a time complexity of O(n^2), which can be improved.
- We can optimize this by creating a separate loop to count the number of empty children for each node. This way, we only need to iterate over `g` once and update the count for each node.

Step 3: Remove unnecessary early termination
- Currently, the `solve` function terminates early as soon as it finds a node with less than 3 empty children. However, we can optimize this by counting the number of nodes with less than 3 empty children and only returning the answer at the end. This way, we can avoid unnecessary early terminations.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

void answer(bool v) {
  constexpr const char *s[2] = {"No", "Yes"};
  std::cout << s[v] << '\n';
}

void solve(const std::vector<size_t> &parent) {
  size_t n = parent.size();
  std::vector<unsigned> empty_child_count(n, 0);

  for (size_t i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
    size_t p = parent[i];
    empty_child_count[p]++;
  }

  for (size_t i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    if (empty_child_count[i] < 3) {
      answer(false);
      return;
    }
  }

  answer(true);
}

int main() {
  size_t n;
  std::cin >> n;
  
  std::vector<size_t> parent(n);
  for (size_t i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
    unsigned p;
    std::cin >> p;
    parent[i] = p - 1;
  }

  solve(parent);
  
  return 0;
}
```
