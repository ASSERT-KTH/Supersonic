Step 1: Remove unnecessary includes and namespaces

The `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` includes a large number of header files, which can increase the compilation time and memory usage. We can replace it with the specific headers that are actually used in the program.

The `using namespace std;` statement imports all names from the `std` namespace into the global namespace. This can lead to naming conflicts and make the code harder to read and maintain. We can remove this statement and use the `std::` prefix where needed.

Step 2: Optimize vector initialization

The line `vector<vector<long long>> tr(mxn, vector<long long>(2));` initializes a 2D vector with `mxn` rows and 2 columns. However, the elements of the vector are not used immediately, so we can delay the initialization until it is actually needed.

Step 3: Optimize input and output operations

The `ios::sync_with_stdio(false)` statement disables the synchronization between C and C++ standard streams, which can improve the performance of input and output operations. However, it is not needed in this program because there is no mixing of C and C++ input/output.

The `cin.tie(0)` statement unties the input stream from the output stream, which can improve the efficiency of input operations. However, it is not necessary in this program because there are no interleaved input and output operations.

Step 4: Optimize the main logic

The main logic of the program is implemented using two lambda functions: `ins` and `qry`. These functions are used to insert and query elements in a trie data structure.

To optimize the program, we can make the following modifications to the `ins` and `qry` functions:

- Instead of using a 2D vector to represent the trie, we can use a flat vector to store the nodes of the trie. This can reduce the memory usage and improve cache locality.

- Instead of using a separate vector `cnt` to keep track of the count of each node in the trie, we can store the count directly in the trie nodes. This can reduce the memory usage and eliminate the need for separate increment and decrement operations.

- Instead of using a for loop to iterate over the bits of a number, we can use a while loop and bitwise operations to iterate over the bits. This can improve the performance of the `ins` and `qry` functions.

- Instead of returning the result of a query, we can pass a reference variable to the `qry` function and update it directly. This can eliminate the need for returning a value and improve the performance of the `qry` function.
