The given program reads an input string `s` and finds the maximum number of consecutive '*' characters between each pair of non-'*' characters. It then calculates the number of seats that can be occupied by two persons, `a` and `b`, such that the number of seats occupied by `a` and `b` is as close as possible.

To optimize the program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary headers: The program includes `<bits/stdc++.h>` header, which is not necessary. We only need to include `<iostream>` and `<vector>` for the program to work correctly.

2. Remove unused variable `t`: The program initializes `t` to 1 but never changes its value or uses it in the loop condition. We can remove this variable since it serves no purpose.

3. Avoid unnecessary sorting: The program sorts the `seat` vector after populating it. However, we don't actually need to sort the vector since the order of the elements doesn't affect the final result. We can remove the sorting step to improve the running time.

4. Improve the loop iteration: The loop that calculates the number of seats occupied by `a` and `b` can be improved. Instead of iterating from 0 to `seat.size() - 1` and accessing `seat[seat.size() - 1 - i]`, we can iterate from `seat.size() - 1` to 0 and access `seat[i]` directly. This avoids the need for subtraction in each iteration.

Based on these optimizations, here is the optimized C++ program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int n, a, b;
  cin >> n >> a >> b;
  string s;
  cin >> s;
  
  vector<int> seat;
  int z = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    if (s[i] == '*') {
      if (z != 0) {
        seat.push_back(z);
      }
      z = 0;
    } else {
      z += 1;
    }
  }
  if (z != 0)
    seat.push_back(z);

  int ans = 0;
  for (int i = seat.size() - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
    if (a == 0 && b == 0)
      break;
    int q = seat[i];
    int x, y;
    if (q & 1) {
      x = q / 2;
      y = x + 1;
    } else {
      x = y = q / 2;
    }
    if (a > b) {
      if (a < y) {
        ans += a;
        a = 0;
      } else {
        ans += y;
        a -= y;
      }
      if (b < x) {
        ans += b;
        b = 0;
      } else {
        ans += x;
        b -= x;
      }
    } else {
      if (a < x) {
        ans += a;
        a = 0;
      } else {
        ans += x;
        a -= x;
      }
      if (b < y) {
        ans += b;
        b = 0;
      } else {
        ans += y;
        b -= y;
      }
    }
  }
  
  cout << ans << "\n";
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized program eliminates unnecessary steps and improves the loop iteration to optimize the running time.
