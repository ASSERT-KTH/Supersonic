Optimization Steps:
1. Remove unnecessary includes: The `<bits/stdc++.h>` header includes a large number of standard library headers, which may not be necessary for this program. We can remove it and include only the necessary headers.
2. Remove unnecessary variable initialization: The variable `t` is initialized to 1 and then decremented immediately before the while loop. We can remove this unnecessary initialization and decrement.
3. Use a more efficient data structure: The program uses a `vector<int>` to store the lengths of consecutive empty seats. However, we only need to keep track of the maximum length. We can replace the vector with a single integer variable to store the maximum length.
4. Use a more efficient loop termination condition: The while loop is currently using `t--` as the termination condition. Since `t` is always 1, the loop will always execute exactly once. We can replace the while loop with a for loop to avoid the unnecessary decrement and comparison.
5. Avoid unnecessary sorting: The program sorts the seat lengths in ascending order using `sort()`. However, this sorting is not necessary for the given problem. We can remove the sorting step to improve the running time.
6. Simplify the seat assignment logic: The program uses multiple if-else conditions to calculate the number of seats to assign to `a` and `b`. We can simplify this logic to reduce the number of comparisons and assignments.

Optimized Program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int n, a, b;
  cin >> n >> a >> b;
  string s;
  cin >> s;
  
  int maxSeatLength = 0;
  int currentSeatLength = 0;
  
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    if (s[i] == '*') {
      if (currentSeatLength > maxSeatLength) {
        maxSeatLength = currentSeatLength;
      }
      currentSeatLength = 0;
    } else {
      currentSeatLength += 1;
    }
  }
  
  if (currentSeatLength > maxSeatLength) {
    maxSeatLength = currentSeatLength;
  }
  
  int ans = 0;
  while (a > 0 || b > 0) {
    int q = maxSeatLength;
    int x = q / 2;
    int y = q - x;
    
    if (a > b) {
      if (a < y) {
        ans += a;
        a = 0;
      } else {
        ans += y;
        a -= y;
      }
      
      if (b < x) {
        ans += b;
        b = 0;
      } else {
        ans += x;
        b -= x;
      }
    } else {
      if (a < x) {
        ans += a;
        a = 0;
      } else {
        ans += x;
        a -= x;
      }
      
      if (b < y) {
        ans += b;
        b = 0;
      } else {
        ans += y;
        b -= y;
      }
    }
  }
  
  cout << ans << "\n";
  
  return 0;
}
