The given program can be optimized in the following steps:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The program includes the header file `bits/stdc++.h`, which includes a large number of standard library headers. This can increase the compilation time and memory usage. Since the program only requires the `iostream` and `vector` headers, we can remove the unnecessary includes.

2. Remove unused variable: The variable `t` is initialized to 1 and then decremented in the `while` loop condition. However, the loop will only run once since `t` is initially 1. Therefore, we can remove the `while` loop and directly read the input.

3. Optimize the loop: The loop that processes the input string `s` can be optimized. Instead of pushing the lengths of consecutive 'empty' seats into the `seat` vector and then sorting it, we can calculate the sum of 'empty' seats and directly use it in the calculation of the answer. This eliminates the need for the `seat` vector and the sorting operation.

4. Simplify the calculation: The calculation of `x` and `y` can be simplified. If `q` is odd, both `x` and `y` will be `(q-1)/2`. If `q` is even, both `x` and `y` will be `q/2`. We can simplify this logic.

5. Optimize the if-else conditions: The if-else conditions can be optimized to reduce the number of comparisons. Instead of checking `a` and `b` against `x` and `y` separately, we can combine the conditions and reduce the number of if-else blocks.

Here is the optimized C++ program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int n, a, b;
  cin >> n >> a >> b;
  string s;
  cin >> s;
  
  int z = 0;
  int ans = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    if (s[i] == '*') {
      ans += (z + 1) / 2;
      z = 0;
    } else {
      z++;
    }
  }
  ans += (z + 1) / 2;

  int x, y;
  if (a > b) {
    x = (a + b) / 2;
    y = (a - b + 1) / 2;
  } else {
    x = (a + b + 1) / 2;
    y = (b - a) / 2;
  }

  ans = min(ans, x) + min(ans, y);
  
  cout << ans << "\n";
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized program eliminates the unnecessary includes, removes the unused variable and simplifies the logic to improve the running time and reduce memory usage.
