Step 1: Remove unnecessary includes
The program includes the headers `<cstring>` and `<vector>`, but it does not use any functions or objects from these headers. Therefore, we can remove these includes to improve compile time and reduce memory usage.

Step 2: Optimize the `dfs` function
In the `dfs` function, the program checks if `v` is not visited before calling the `dfs` function recursively. However, we can avoid this check by using a different approach.

Instead of using the `vis` array to mark visited nodes, we can modify the `a` array itself to mark visited nodes. We can set `a[i]` to 0 after visiting node `a[i]`. This way, we can check if `a[i]` is visited by checking if it is equal to 0. This eliminates the need for the `vis` array and improves performance.

Step 3: Optimize the `qmi` function
The `qmi` function calculates the power of 2 raised to `cnt` modulo `N`. Currently, it uses an iterative approach that calculates the power using repeated squaring. However, we can optimize this function further by using the binary exponentiation algorithm.

The binary exponentiation algorithm calculates the power in logarithmic time complexity. We can modify the `qmi` function to use this algorithm instead of the iterative approach, which will improve the performance.

Step 4: Remove unnecessary `memset`
The program uses `memset` to set the `vis` array to 0 before each test case. However, it is not necessary to set the entire array to 0 because the `dfs` function modifies the array during its execution. We can remove the `memset` call to optimize the program.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#define int long long
const int N = 1e9 + 7;
int t, n, cnt;
int a[400005];
std::vector<int> e[400005];

void dfs(int u) {
  a[u] = 0;
  for (int v : e[u]) {
    if (a[v] != 0) {
      dfs(v);
    }
  }
}

int qmi(int cnt) {
  int x = 2, s = 1;
  while (cnt) {
    if (cnt & 1) {
      s = s * x % N;
    }
    x = x * x % N;
    cnt >>= 1;
  }
  return s % N;
}

signed main() {
  std::cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    std::cin >> n;
    cnt = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
      std::cin >> a[i];
      e[i].clear();
    }
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
      int v;
      std::cin >> v;
      e[a[i]].push_back(v);
    }
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
      if (a[i] != 0) {
        cnt++;
        dfs(a[i]);
      }
    }
    std::cout << qmi(cnt) << std::endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Explanation:
- Removed unnecessary includes `<cstring>` and `<vector>`.
- Modified the `dfs` function to mark visited nodes by setting `a[i]` to 0.
- Optimized the `qmi` function using the binary exponentiation algorithm.
- Removed the unnecessary `memset` call to optimize the program.
