One possible optimization for this program is to use a more efficient way to calculate the power of 2 modulo N. 

In the original program, the function `qmi` is used to calculate `s = s * x % N`, where `s` is initially set to 1 and `x` is initially set to 2. This operation is performed `cnt` times.

To optimize this, we can use the binary exponentiation algorithm to calculate `s = (s * x) % N` in a more efficient way. The binary exponentiation algorithm reduces the number of multiplications required to calculate the power of `x` by using the binary representation of `cnt`.

Here are the steps to optimize the program:

1. Remove the `#define int long long` line, as it is not used in the program.

2. Replace the `qmi` function with an optimized version using the binary exponentiation algorithm.

3. Remove the `memset(vis, 0, sizeof vis);` line, as it is not necessary.

4. Update the `dfs` function to use a reference to the vector `e` instead of passing it as a parameter.

5. Remove the `e[i].clear();` line, as it is not necessary.

6. Update the `main` function to use a reference to the vector `e` instead of passing it as a parameter.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

const int N = 1e9 + 7;

int t, n, cnt;
int a[400005], vis[400005];
vector<int> e[400005];

void dfs(int u, vector<int>& e) {
  vis[u] = 1;
  for (int v, i = 0; i < e[u].size(); ++i) {
    v = e[u][i];
    if (!vis[v])
      dfs(v, e);
  }
}

int qmi(int cnt) {
  int x = 2, s = 1;
  while (cnt) {
    if (cnt & 1)
      s = (s * x) % N;
    x = (x * x) % N;
    cnt >>= 1;
  }
  return s;
}

int main() {
  cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    cin >> n;
    cnt = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
      cin >> a[i];
      e[i].clear();
    }
    for (int v, i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
      cin >> v;
      e[a[i]].push_back(v);
    }
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++)
      if (!vis[a[i]])
        cnt++, dfs(a[i], e);
    cout << qmi(cnt) << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```
