The given program solves a problem where we need to assign unique numbers to an array of size `n` such that the given numbers appear in the same order as they appear in the input array, and the remaining numbers are assigned in ascending order starting from 1.

To optimize the program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Instead of using `map<int, int> m` to store the index of each number, we can use an array `m` of size `2e5 + 12` to store the index. By using an array instead of a map, we can reduce the memory usage and improve the performance of accessing the index.

2. We can avoid using the `check` vector by utilizing the `m` array. Instead of checking `check[a[i]]`, we can check `m[a[i]]`. If `m[a[i]]` is 0, it means the number `a[i]` has not been assigned yet.

3. We can remove the `k` vector and the loop to fill it. Instead, we can use a variable `h` to keep track of the next available number to assign. We initialize `h` to `n + 1`, and decrement it when assigning a number to `ans[i]`.

4. We can simplify the assignment of `ans[i]` when it is 0. Instead of using `ans[i] = k[h - 1]`, we can directly assign `ans[i] = h - 1` and decrement `h`.

5. We can remove the `print` function and print the output directly in the `main` function to avoid unnecessary function calls.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int solve(int n, vector<int> &ans, vector<int> a, int *m) {
  int c = 0;
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    if (m[a[i]] == 0) {
      ans[i] = a[i];
      m[a[i]] = i;
      c++;
    }
  }
  int h = n + 1;
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    if (ans[i] == 0) {
      ans[i] = h - 1;
      h--;
    }
  }
  return c;
}

int main() {
  int t;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    int n;
    cin >> n;
    vector<int> a(n + 1);
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++)
      cin >> a[i];
    vector<int> ans(n + 1);
    int m[200012] = {0};
    int number = solve(n, ans, a, m);
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
      if (ans[i] == i) {
        ans[i] = a[i];
        ans[m[a[i]]] = i;
      }
    }
    cout << number << "\n";
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++)
      cout << ans[i] << " ";
    cout << "\n";
  }
  return 0;
}
```

By making these optimizations, we have reduced the memory usage and improved the performance of the program.
