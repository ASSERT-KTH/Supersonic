Step 1: Remove unnecessary header files

The program includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header file, which is not a standard C/C++ header file and includes a large number of other header files. This can increase the compilation time and memory usage. Since the program does not use any specific headers from this file, we can remove it.

Step 2: Optimize the `mark` array initialization

The program initializes the `mark` array with zeros using a loop. This can be replaced with a single line of code using the `memset` function, which can be more efficient.

Step 3: Optimize the calculation of the `ans` vector

The program calculates the elements of the `ans` vector using a loop and conditional statements. Instead, we can calculate them directly using a formula and push them into the vector. This can simplify the code and potentially improve performance.

Step 4: Avoid unnecessary calculations in the while loop

The program unnecessarily calculates the sum of the elements in the `ans` vector in each iteration of the while loop. We can avoid this calculation by keeping track of the current sum using a variable.

Step 5: Remove unnecessary variable declarations

The program declares several variables that are not used. We can remove these declarations to improve code readability and potentially save memory.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

typedef long long ll;

void solve() {
  ll n;
  cin >> n;
  vector<ll> ans;
  int mark[5001];
  memset(mark, 0, sizeof(mark));
  ans.push_back(1);
  n--;
  mark[1] = 1;
  int lastPush = 1;
  ll currentSum = 1;
  while (n > 0) {
    ll nextNum = min(n, lastPush + 2);
    ans.push_back(nextNum);
    lastPush = nextNum;
    n -= nextNum;
    currentSum += nextNum;
  }
  cout << ans.size() << "\n";
}

int main() {
  int t;
  cin >> t;
  while (t-- > 0) {
    solve();
  }
  return 0;
}
```
