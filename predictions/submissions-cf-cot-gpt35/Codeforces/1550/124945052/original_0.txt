The given program calculates and prints the size of a vector `ans` which contains a sequence of numbers. The sequence starts with 1 and each subsequent number is either the previous number plus 2 or the remaining value of `n`, whichever is smaller.

To optimize the program for running time and memory usage, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary include statements: The program includes the entire `<bits/stdc++.h>` library, which is not recommended. We can remove this line and include only the necessary headers.

2. Remove unused macros: The macros `sz`, `all`, `fi`, `se`, `vi`, `vl`, `pii`, `loop`, `mod`, and `MAX_VALUE` are not used in the program. We can remove these macros to simplify the code.

3. Use `vector<bool>` instead of `int` array: The program uses an `int` array `mark` to mark visited numbers. Since we only need to store binary information (visited or not), we can use a `vector<bool>` instead of an `int` array. This will reduce memory usage.

4. Optimize the sequence calculation: The current logic for calculating the sequence is not efficient. It uses a loop to check if the next number should be the previous number plus 2 or the remaining value of `n`. Instead, we can calculate the number of iterations required to reach the remaining value of `n` and add the numbers directly to the vector `ans`. This will reduce the number of iterations and improve running time.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

typedef long long ll;

void solve() {
  ll n;
  cin >> n;
  vector<ll> ans;
  vector<bool> mark(5001, false);
  ans.push_back(1);
  n--;
  mark[1] = true;
  ll lastPush = 1;
  
  // Calculate the number of iterations required
  ll iterations = min(n / 2, lastPush + 1);
  for (int i = 0; i < iterations; i++) {
    lastPush += 2;
    ans.push_back(lastPush);
    mark[lastPush] = true;
    n -= lastPush;
  }
  
  // Check if there is a remaining value of n
  if (n > 0 && !mark[n]) {
    ans.push_back(n);
  }
  
  cout << ans.size() << "\n";
}

int main() {
  int t;
  cin >> t;
  while (t-- > 0) {
    solve();
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Explanation of optimizations:

1. Removed unnecessary include statements:
   - `<bits/stdc++.h>` was removed and replaced with the necessary headers `<iostream>` and `<vector>`.

2. Removed unused macros:
   - Removed the unused macros for simplicity.

3. Used `vector<bool>` instead of `int` array:
   - Replaced the `int` array `mark` with a `vector<bool>` to reduce memory usage.

4. Optimized the sequence calculation:
   - Calculated the number of iterations required to reach the remaining value of `n`.
   - Added the numbers directly to the vector `ans` within the loop, reducing the number of iterations.
   - Checked if there is a remaining value of `n` and added it to the vector if it's not already marked as visited.
