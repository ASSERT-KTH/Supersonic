To optimize the given program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary header files: The program includes the `bits/stdc++.h` header file which includes a lot of other header files. Instead of including this file, we can include only the necessary header files like `<iostream>` and `<vector>`.

2. Remove unnecessary macros: The program defines some macros like `ll`, `sz`, `all`, `fi`, `se`, `vi`, `vl`, `pii`, `loop`, `mod`, and `MAX_VALUE`. These macros are not used in the program and can be removed.

3. Remove unnecessary functions: The program defines two unnecessary functions `gcd` and `sortace`. Since these functions are not used, we can remove them.

4. Simplify the loop: The program uses a loop to initialize the `mark` array with zeros. Instead of using a loop, we can use the `memset` function to set all elements of the array to zero.

5. Use `vector` instead of array: The program uses a fixed-size array `mark` to mark the visited elements. Instead of using an array, we can use a `vector` to dynamically manage the size of the visited elements.

6. Simplify the logic: The logic for generating the `ans` vector can be simplified. Instead of checking if `lastPush + 2` is greater than or equal to `n`, we can directly push `n` to the `ans` vector and subtract `n` from `lastPush`. This will reduce the number of iterations in the loop.

7. Remove unnecessary variables: The program defines two unnecessary variables `mark` and `lastPush`. Since these variables are not used, we can remove them.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

void solve() {
    int n;
    cin >> n;
    vector<int> ans;
    ans.push_back(1);
    n--;
    int lastPush = 1;
    while (n > 0) {
        ans.push_back(lastPush + 2);
        lastPush += 2;
        n -= lastPush;
    }
    cout << ans.size() << "\n";
}

int main() {
    int t;
    cin >> t;
    while (t-- > 0) {
        solve();
    }
    return 0;
}
```
