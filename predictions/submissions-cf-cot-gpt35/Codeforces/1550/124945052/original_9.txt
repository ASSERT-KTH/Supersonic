Optimization steps:

1. Remove unnecessary header files: The `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` header file includes a large number of standard library headers, which can slow down the compilation process. We can remove this line and include only the necessary standard library headers.

2. Remove unnecessary preprocessor definitions: The preprocessor definitions `ll`, `sz(x)`, `all(x)`, `fi`, `se`, `vi`, `vl`, `pii`, `loop`, `mod`, and `MAX_VALUE` are not used in the program. We can remove these definitions.

3. Remove unnecessary functions: The functions `gcd`, `sortdec`, and `sortace` are not used in the program. We can remove these functions.

4. Optimize the loop: The loop `loop(i, 0, 5001) mark[i] = 0;` initializes the `mark` array with zeros. However, the array is not used in the program. We can remove this loop to improve runtime performance.

5. Simplify the logic for calculating the `ans` vector: The current logic for calculating the `ans` vector is not optimal. We can simplify the logic to reduce the number of operations and improve runtime performance.

Optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

void solve() {
    int n;
    cin >> n;
    vector<int> ans;
    ans.push_back(1);
    n--;
    int lastPush = 1;
    while (n > 0) {
        if (lastPush + 2 >= n) {
            ans.push_back(n);
            lastPush += 2;
            n -= n;
        } else {
            ans.push_back(lastPush + 2);
            lastPush += 2;
            n -= lastPush;
        }
    }
    cout << ans.size() << "\n";
}

int main() {
    int t;
    cin >> t;
    while (t-- > 0) {
        solve();
    }
    return 0;
}
```

Explanation:

1. Removed unnecessary header files: The unnecessary `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` header file is removed. Only the necessary standard library headers `iostream` and `vector` are included.

2. Removed unnecessary preprocessor definitions: The unnecessary preprocessor definitions `ll`, `sz(x)`, `all(x)`, `fi`, `se`, `vi`, `vl`, `pii`, `loop`, `mod`, and `MAX_VALUE` are removed.

3. Removed unnecessary functions: The unnecessary functions `gcd`, `sortdec`, and `sortace` are removed.

4. Optimized the loop: The loop `loop(i, 0, 5001) mark[i] = 0;` is removed as it is not used in the program.

5. Simplified the logic for calculating the `ans` vector: The logic for calculating the `ans` vector is simplified to reduce the number of operations and improve runtime performance. The unnecessary `mark` array is removed and the logic for pushing elements to the `ans` vector is modified accordingly.
