To optimize the given program, we can make the following changes:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The program includes `<bits/stdc++.h>` which includes a lot of unnecessary headers. We can remove this line and include only the required headers.

2. Remove unnecessary macros: The program defines macros such as `ll`, `sz`, `all`, `fi`, `se`, `vi`, `vl`, `pii`, `loop`, `mod`, and `MAX_VALUE` which are not used. We can remove these macros to simplify the code.

3. Remove unnecessary functions: The program defines unnecessary functions such as `gcd`, `sortdec`, and `sortace` which are not used. We can remove these functions to reduce the code complexity.

4. Optimize the loop: The loop in the `solve` function can be optimized. Instead of using a loop and calculating the next value to push into the `ans` vector, we can directly calculate the values based on the current `lastPush` value and `n`. This will eliminate the need for the `mark` array and unnecessary calculations.

5. Modify the loop condition: The loop in the `main` function can be modified to directly iterate `t` times using a decrementing `for` loop instead of using a `while` loop.

After applying these optimizations, the optimized program is as follows:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

void solve() {
  long long n;
  cin >> n;
  vector<long long> ans;
  ans.push_back(1);
  n--;
  long long lastPush = 1;
  while (n > 0) {
    if (lastPush + 2 >= n) {
      ans.push_back(n);
      lastPush += 2;
      n -= n;
    } else {
      ans.push_back(lastPush + 2);
      lastPush += 2;
      n -= lastPush;
    }
  }
  cout << ans.size() << "\n";
}

int main() {
  int t;
  cin >> t;
  for (int i = 0; i < t; i++) {
    solve();
  }
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized program eliminates unnecessary code and simplifies the loop logic to improve runtime and memory usage.
