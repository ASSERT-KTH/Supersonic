The given program is using the Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) algorithm to find the longest prefix of a string that is also a suffix. The program then performs some calculations based on this information and prints the result.

To optimize this program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary variables: The variables `x` and `j` are not required and can be removed.

2. Optimize the loop condition: Instead of `i <= n`, we can use `i < n` as the loop condition since we don't need to access the `n`th element of the array `s`.

3. Optimize the comparison in the inner loop: Instead of `s[j + 1] ^ s[i]`, we can use `s[j] != s[i]` for better performance.

4. Optimize the calculation in the second loop: Instead of performing the division `(x / (x - f[x]) / k) > ((x - 1) / (x - f[x]) / (k + 1))`, we can simplify it to `(x * (k + 1)) > ((x - 1) * k)`. This avoids the division operation and reduces the number of computations.

5. Change the return type of `main()`: The return type of `main()` should be `int` instead of `void`.

With these optimizations in mind, the optimized program is as follows:

```c
#include <cstdio>

char s[1000005];
int f[1000005], n, k, i = 2;

int main() {
  scanf("%d%d%s", &n, &k, s + 1);

  for (; i < n; ++i) {
    int j = f[i - 1];
    while (j && s[j] != s[i])
      j = f[j - 1];
    f[i] = (s[j] == s[i]) ? j + 1 : 0;
  }

  for (int x = 1; x <= n; ++x)
    putchar((((x * (k + 1)) > ((x - 1) * k))) + '0');

  return 0;
}
```

This optimized program reduces the number of unnecessary variables and operations, resulting in improved running time and memory usage.
