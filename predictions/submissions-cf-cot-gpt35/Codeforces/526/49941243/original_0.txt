The given program is a C++ program that implements a string matching algorithm called KMP (Knuth-Morris-Pratt) algorithm. The algorithm finds the number of occurrences of a specific pattern in a given string.

To optimize the program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unused variables: The variable `x` is not used after the loop ends, so we can remove it.

2. Use `std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false)` to improve input/output performance.

3. Use `std::vector` instead of a fixed-size array for `s` and `f`. This will allow dynamic memory allocation and reduce memory usage.

4. Change the loop condition in the second loop to `x < n` instead of `x <= n`. This will avoid accessing out-of-bounds memory.

5. Use a temporary variable to store the result of `x - f[x]` calculation, instead of calculating it twice.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

int main() {
  std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);

  int n, k;
  std::cin >> n >> k;

  std::vector<char> s(n + 1);
  std::vector<int> f(n + 1);
  
  for (int i = 2, j = 0; i <= n; ++i) {
    while (j && s[j + 1] != s[i]) {
      j = f[j];
    }
    if (s[j + 1] == s[i]) {
      ++j;
    }
    f[i] = j;
  }

  for (int x = 1; x < n; ++x) {
    int temp = x - f[x];
    putchar((((x / temp / k) > ((x - 1) / temp / (k + 1)))) + '0');
  }

  return 0;
}
```

This optimized program will have improved running time and reduced memory usage compared to the original program.
