The given program is a C++ program that takes input values for `n` and `k`, and a string `s`. It then calculates an array `f` using the KMP algorithm and prints the result based on certain conditions.

To optimize the program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Since we are using C++, we can replace the `#import <cstdio>` with `#include <iostream>`. This will allow us to use `cout` instead of `putchar` for printing the result.
2. We can change the type of the `f` array from `int` to `char` since its values are only used for comparison with `s[j + 1] ^ s[i]`.
3. We can remove the unnecessary variable `x` and use `i` directly in the second loop.
4. We can optimize the conditions inside the `putchar` statement for better readability.

Here is the optimized C++ program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

char s[1000005];
char f[1000005];
int n, k, i = 2, j;

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  
  cin >> n >> k >> (s + 1);
  
  for (; i <= n; i++) {
    while (j && s[j + 1] != s[i])
      j = f[j];
    if (s[j + 1] == s[i])
      j++;
    f[i] = j;
  }
  
  for (i = 1; i <= n; i++)
    cout << (((i / (i - f[i]) / k) > ((i - 1) / (i - f[i]) / (k + 1))) ? '1' : '0');
  
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized program should have improved running time and memory usage compared to the original program.
