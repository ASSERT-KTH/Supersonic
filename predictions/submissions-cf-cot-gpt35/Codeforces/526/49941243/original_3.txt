The given program is an implementation of the KMP algorithm for string matching. The optimization can be done in the following steps:

Step 1: Remove unnecessary variables and optimize variable declarations.
- Remove the variable `x` as it is not being used for any purpose.
- Move the variable `i` declaration inside the for loop since it is only used within the loop.
- Combine the variable declarations of `i` and `j` into a single declaration.

Step 2: Optimize the conditions in the while and for loops.
- Simplify the condition in the while loop to use the bitwise XOR operator (`^`) instead of the logical XOR operator (`||`).
- Simplify the condition in the for loop to use the bitwise AND operator (`&`) instead of the logical AND operator (`>`).

Step 3: Optimize the putchar statement.
- Remove the addition of 48 from the putchar statement and directly print the result as the ASCII value.

Here is the optimized program:

```c++
#include <cstdio>

char s[1000005];
int f[1000005], n, k, j;

int main() {
  scanf("%d%d%s", &n, &k, s + 1);
  
  for (int i = 2; i <= n; ++i) {
    while (j && (s[j + 1] ^ s[i])) {
      j = f[j];
    }
    (s[j + 1] ^ s[i]) ? ++j : 0;
    f[i] = j;
  }

  for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
    putchar((((i / (i - f[i]) / k) & ((i - 1) / (i - f[i]) / (k + 1)))));
  }
}
```
