Step 1: Remove unnecessary variable declarations and initializations.
- Remove the declaration and initialization of variable `x` as it is not used in the program.

Step 2: Optimize the loop conditions.
- In the first loop, change the condition from `i <= n` to `i < n` since the loop is already incrementing `i` inside it.
- In the second loop, change the condition from `x <= n` to `x < n` for the same reason.

Step 3: Simplify the expression in the second loop.
- Instead of the complex expression `(((x / (x - f[x]) / k) > ((x - 1) / (x - f[x]) / (k + 1))))`, we can simplify it to `(x / (x - f[x]) / k > (x - 1) / (x - f[x]) / (k + 1))` since the division operator `/` has higher precedence than the comparison operator `>`.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#import <cstdio>
char s[1000005];
int f[1000005], n, k, i = 2, j;
main() {
  for (scanf("%d%d%s", &n, &k, s + 1); i < n;) {
    while (j && s[j + 1] ^ s[i])
      j = f[j];
    (s[j + 1] ^ s[i]) || ++j;
    f[i++] = j;
  }
  for (; x < n; ++x)
    putchar((x / (x - f[x]) / k > (x - 1) / (x - f[x]) / (k + 1)) + 48);
}
```
