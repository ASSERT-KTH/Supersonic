Explanation of the optimization steps:

1. Eliminate unnecessary variables and declarations: The variable `x` is not needed in the program. The `#import <cstdio>` line can be replaced with `#include <cstdio>`.

2. Improve memory usage: The arrays `s` and `f` have a fixed size of 1000005. However, the input size `n` can be smaller than that. Instead of using fixed-size arrays, we can use dynamic memory allocation to reduce memory usage. We can allocate memory dynamically for arrays `s` and `f` based on the input size `n`.

3. Optimize the loop conditions: The second loop can be optimized by changing the loop condition from `x <= n` to `x < n`. This is because `n` is the length of the string `s`, and the array index is zero-based.

4. Simplify the output calculation: The expression `((x / (x - f[x]) / k) > ((x - 1) / (x - f[x]) / (k + 1)))` can be simplified by removing unnecessary divisions and using a single variable `curr` to store the value of `(x / (x - f[x]))`. This will reduce the number of divisions and make the code more readable.

5. Use `puts` instead of `putchar` for output: Instead of using `putchar` to output a single character at a time, we can use the `puts` function to output a string at once. This will reduce the number of function calls and improve performance.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <cstdio>
#include <cstring>

int main() {
  int n, k;
  scanf("%d%d", &n, &k);

  char* s = new char[n + 1];
  scanf("%s", s);

  int* f = new int[n + 1];
  memset(f, 0, sizeof(int) * (n + 1));

  int j = 0;
  for (int i = 2; i <= n; ++i) {
    while (j && s[j] != s[i - 1])
      j = f[j];
    if (s[j] == s[i - 1])
      ++j;
    f[i] = j;
  }

  char* result = new char[n + 1];

  for (int x = 0; x < n; ++x) {
    int curr = x / (x - f[x]);
    result[x] = ((curr / k) > ((x - 1) / (x - f[x]) / (k + 1))) ? '1' : '0';
  }

  result[n] = '\0';
  puts(result);

  delete[] s;
  delete[] f;
  delete[] result;

  return 0;
}
```
