Step 1: Remove unnecessary includes and macros.

The `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` includes a large number of standard library headers, which may not be necessary for this program. We can replace it with specific headers that are actually used in the program.

The `#ifdef PERVEEVM_LOCAL` and `#define debug(x)` macros are not used in the program. We can remove them.

Step 2: Optimize the `gcd` function.

The `gcd` function uses a recursive algorithm to calculate the greatest common divisor. We can replace it with the `__gcd` function provided by the C++ standard library, which is faster and more efficient.

Step 3: Optimize the `lcm` function.

The `lcm` function calculates the least common multiple using the `gcd` function. However, it also checks for potential overflow by comparing `a` with `LINF / b`. This check is unnecessary because the program already checks if `l > n` and exits if true. We can remove the check to improve performance.

Step 4: Optimize the `solve` function.

The `solve` function calculates the solution for a pair of congruences using the Chinese Remainder Theorem. However, it uses the `gcdEx` function to calculate the modular inverse, which is not necessary. We can replace it with the `%` operator to calculate the modular inverse directly.

Step 5: Optimize the `run` function.

The `run` function reads input using `scanf`. We can replace it with `cin` for faster input processing.

Step 6: Optimize the `main` function.

The `main` function measures the execution time using `std::chrono::high_resolution_clock`. This is not necessary for the optimization task. We can remove the timing code.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

typedef long long ll;

ll gcd(ll a, ll b) {
  return __gcd(a, b);
}

ll lcm(ll a, ll b) {
  return a / gcd(a, b) * b;
}

ll solve(ll r1, ll mod1, ll r2, ll mod2) {
  ll g = gcd(mod1, mod2);
  if (r1 % g != r2 % g) {
    printf("NO\n");
    exit(0);
  }
  ll a = mod1 / g;
  ll b = (r2 - r1) / g;
  ll c = mod2 / g;
  ll x = ((b % c) + c) % c;
  ll k = (b * x) % c;
  ll ans = (r1 + k * mod1) % lcm(mod1, mod2);
  return ans;
}

void run() {
  ll n, m;
  int k;
  cin >> n >> m >> k;
  vector<ll> a(k);
  for (int i = 0; i < k; ++i) {
    cin >> a[i];
  }
  ll l = a[0];
  for (int i = 1; i < k; ++i) {
    l = lcm(l, a[i]);
  }
  if (l > n) {
    printf("NO\n");
    return;
  }
  vector<pair<ll, ll>> eq(k);
  for (int i = 0; i < k; ++i) {
    eq[i].second = a[i];
    eq[i].first = ((-i) % a[i] + a[i]) % a[i];
  }
  ll r1 = eq[0].first;
  ll mod1 = eq[0].second;
  for (int i = 1; i < k; ++i) {
    ll curMod = lcm(mod1, eq[i].second);
    ll curR = solve(r1, mod1, eq[i].first, eq[i].second);
    r1 = (curR % curMod + curMod) % curMod;
    mod1 = curMod;
  }
  if (r1 == 0) {
    r1 += mod1;
  }
  if (r1 + k - 1 > m) {
    printf("NO\n");
    return;
  }
  for (int i = 0; i < k; ++i) {
    if (gcd(l, r1 + i) != a[i]) {
      printf("NO\n");
      return;
    }
  }
  printf("YES\n");
}

int main(void) {
  run();
  return 0;
}
```

Explanation:

1. Removed unnecessary includes and macros.
2. Replaced the `gcd` function with the `__gcd` function provided by the C++ standard library.
3. Removed unnecessary check for potential overflow in the `lcm` function.
4. Replaced the `gcdEx` function in the `solve` function with the `%` operator to calculate the modular inverse directly.
5. Replaced `scanf` with `cin` in the `run` function for faster input processing.
6. Removed the timing code from the `main` function.
