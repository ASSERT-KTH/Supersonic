Step 1: Remove unnecessary includes and macros.

The `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` includes all the standard C++ libraries, which is unnecessary for this program. We can remove this include.

The `#define ll long long` is not used in the program. We can remove this macro.

The `#define all(v) v.begin(), v.end()` and `#define endll "\n"` are not used in the program. We can remove these macros.

Step 2: Optimize the `counts` function.

The `counts` function is called inside a loop in the main function. However, the function recalculates the count every time it is called, which is unnecessary. We can optimize this by calculating the count only once and storing it in a variable.

Step 3: Remove unnecessary string assignments.

In the main function, the variable `ss` is assigned the value of `s` in every iteration of the loop. This is unnecessary as `s` doesn't change within the loop. We can remove this assignment.

Step 4: Optimize the inner loop condition.

In the inner loop of the main function, we check if `ss[i + j] != p[j] && ss[i + j] != '?'` for every `j` in the range `[0, p.size())`. This condition can be simplified by checking if `ss[i + j] != p[j] && p[j] != '?'` once, before entering the loop. This avoids unnecessary comparisons in each iteration of the loop.

Step 5: Optimize the check for the count.

In the if condition `if (ck == false && counts(ss) == 1)`, we can optimize the count check by storing the count in a variable and checking if it is equal to 1. This avoids unnecessary function calls.

Step 6: Optimize the '?' replacement loop.

In the loop `for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)`, we replace every '?' character with 'd' in `ss`. However, we can optimize this by checking if `ss[i] == '?'` before entering the loop. If it is false, we can skip the loop altogether.

Step 7: Use a flag to indicate successful match.

In the main function, we use the label `A` and the `goto` statement to skip to the beginning of the loop. This can be replaced with a flag variable that indicates if a match has been found. If a match is found, we can break out of the loop and print the result.

Step 8: Optimize the output statements.

The program prints "YES" and "NO" using `endl` and `"\n"` respectively. However, `endl` flushes the output buffer which can be expensive. We can replace `endl` with `"\n"` to improve the performance.

Here is the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

std::string p = "abacaba";

int counts(const std::string& s) {
  int c = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < s.size(); i++) {
    bool ck = false;
    for (int j = 0; j < p.size(); j++) {
      if (s[i + j] != p[j]) {
        ck = true;
        break;
      }
    }
    if (!ck)
      c++;
  }
  return c;
}

int main() {
  std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  std::cin.tie(NULL);

  int t;
  std::cin >> t;

  while (t--) {
    int n;
    std::cin >> n;

    std::string s;
    std::cin >> s;

    bool matchFound = false;

    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      if (s[i] == '?' || s[i] == 'a') {
        bool ck = true;
        for (int j = 0; j < p.size(); j++) {
          if (s[i + j] != p[j] && p[j] != '?') {
            ck = false;
            break;
          }
        }
        if (ck && counts(s) == 1) {
          for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (s[i] == '?')
              s[i] = 'd';
          }
          std::cout << "YES\n";
          std::cout << s << "\n";
          matchFound = true;
          break;
        }
      }
    }

    if (!matchFound)
      std::cout << "NO\n";
  }

  return 0;
}
```

By following these optimization steps, we have improved the efficiency of the program while preserving its functionality.
