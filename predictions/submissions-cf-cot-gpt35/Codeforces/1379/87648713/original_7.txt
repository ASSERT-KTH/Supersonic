The given program is checking whether a given string can be modified to contain exactly one occurrence of the pattern "abacaba". If it is possible, the modified string is printed.

To optimize the program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Instead of checking for the pattern "abacaba" by comparing characters one by one, we can use the `string::find` function to search for the pattern in the given string. This will reduce the time complexity of the inner loop from O(m) to O(1), where m is the size of the pattern.

2. We can avoid creating a copy of the string `s` for each iteration of the outer loop. Instead, we can use an index variable to keep track of the current position in the string.

3. We can also avoid calling the `counts` function, which calculates the number of occurrences of the pattern in the modified string. Since we are only interested in checking whether there is exactly one occurrence of the pattern, we can maintain a counter variable and increment it whenever we find a valid modification.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
#define ll long long
#define all(v) v.begin(), v.end()
#define endll "\n"
string p = "abacaba";
int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  int t;
  cin >> t;
A:
  while (t--) {
    int n;
    cin >> n;
    string s;
    cin >> s;
    int occurrences = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i <= n - p.size(); i++) {
      bool ck = false;
      if (s[i] == '?' || s[i] == 'a') {
        if (s.substr(i, p.size()) == p) {
          ck = true;
          for (int j = i; j < i + p.size(); j++) {
            if (s[j] == '?')
              s[j] = p[j - i];
          }
        }
      }
      if (ck && occurrences == 0)
        occurrences++;
    }
    if (occurrences == 1) {
      for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (s[i] == '?')
          s[i] = 'd';
      }
      cout << "YES" << endl;
      cout << s << endl;
      goto A;
    }
    cout << "NO" << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Explanation of optimizations:

1. We replaced the inner loop that compares characters with a single call to `string::substr` to extract a substring of the same size as the pattern. We then compare this substring with the pattern using the equality operator.

2. We removed the unnecessary copying of the string `s` by using an index variable `i` instead. This index variable keeps track of the current position in the string `s`.

3. We replaced the `counts` function with a counter variable `occurrences`. This variable is incremented whenever a valid modification is found. We only check if `occurrences` is equal to 1 at the end, instead of calling the `counts` function.
