Step 1: Remove unnecessary include statements

The `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` includes a lot of unnecessary standard library headers. We can replace it with only the necessary headers, which are `<iostream>` and `<string>`.

Step 2: Remove unnecessary macros

The `#define ll long long`, `#define all(v) v.begin(), v.end()`, and `#define endll "\n"` macros are not used in the program. We can remove them.

Step 3: Optimize the `counts` function

The `counts` function is currently implemented in an inefficient way. It iterates over each character of the string `s` and for each character, it iterates over the characters of the pattern `p`. This results in a time complexity of O(n * m), where n is the length of `s` and m is the length of `p`.

To optimize this function, we can use the Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) algorithm to find all occurrences of `p` in `s`. The KMP algorithm has a time complexity of O(n + m), where n is the length of `s` and m is the length of `p`.

Step 4: Optimize the main loop

The main loop in the `main` function iterates over each character of the input string `s` and checks if a substring of `s` starting from the current character matches the pattern `p`. If it does, it replaces any question marks in the substring with the corresponding characters from `p` and checks if the modified string `ss` has exactly one occurrence of `p` using the `counts` function.

This approach has a time complexity of O(n * m^2), where n is the length of `s` and m is the length of `p`. This is because for each character in `s`, we iterate over a substring of `s` of length m, and for each character in the substring, we iterate over the characters of `p`.

To optimize this loop, we can use the KMP algorithm to find all occurrences of `p` in `s`. Instead of iterating over each character in `s`, we can iterate over the occurrences of `p` and check if the corresponding substring of `s` has exactly one occurrence of `p`. This reduces the time complexity to O(n + m), where n is the length of `s` and m is the length of `p`.

Step 5: Replace the '?' characters with 'd' in the final string

The final string `ss` is checked for question marks and replaced with 'd' characters if necessary. This can be done in the same loop where we check if `ss` has exactly one occurrence of `p`. This avoids the need for an extra loop.
