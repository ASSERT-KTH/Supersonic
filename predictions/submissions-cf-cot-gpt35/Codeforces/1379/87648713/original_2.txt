The given program searches for a substring "abacaba" in a given string and replaces any occurrences of '?' with appropriate characters to form the substring. If there is exactly one occurrence of the substring, it prints "YES" followed by the modified string. Otherwise, it prints "NO".

To optimize this program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The program includes the entire "bits/stdc++.h" header, which is not recommended. We can remove this line and include only the necessary headers.

2. Remove unnecessary function calls: The function "counts" is called multiple times unnecessarily. We can optimize this by keeping track of the count while checking for occurrences of "abacaba" in the string.

3. Use a more efficient string comparison: Instead of comparing characters one by one, we can use the "substr" function to extract a substring of the same length as "abacaba" from the given string and compare it directly with "abacaba".

4. Avoid unnecessary string assignments: The string "ss" is assigned the value of "s" in each iteration of the outer loop. We can avoid this assignment by using "s" directly.

5. Use a flag variable to track occurrences: We can use a flag variable to keep track of the number of occurrences of "abacaba" in the string. If the flag variable exceeds 1, we can skip further processing for that iteration.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

using namespace std;

#define ll long long

string p = "abacaba";

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);

  int t;
  cin >> t;

  while (t--) {
    int n;
    cin >> n;

    string s;
    cin >> s;

    int count = 0;
    int index = -1;

    for (int i = 0; i <= n - p.size(); i++) {
      string sub = s.substr(i, p.size());

      if (sub == p) {
        if (count > 1) {
          break;
        }

        index = i;
        count++;
      }
    }

    if (count == 1) {
      for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (s[i] == '?') {
          s[i] = 'd';
        }
      }

      cout << "YES" << endl;
      for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (i == index) {
          cout << s.substr(i, p.size());
          i += p.size() - 1;
        } else {
          cout << s[i];
        }
      }
      cout << endl;
    } else {
      cout << "NO" << endl;
    }
  }

  return 0;
}
```

Explanation:

1. We removed the unnecessary includes and kept only the necessary ones: `iostream` and `string`.

2. We removed the `counts` function and replaced it with a variable `count` to keep track of the number of occurrences of "abacaba" in the string.

3. We replaced the nested loop with a single loop that extracts substrings of the same length as "abacaba" from the given string and compares them directly.

4. We avoided unnecessary string assignments by using `s` directly instead of assigning it to `ss`.

5. We used a flag variable `count` to track the number of occurrences of "abacaba" in the string. If the count exceeds 1, we break out of the loop.

6. We modified the printing logic to handle the case where "abacaba" is found. We print the modified string by substituting "abacaba" with the appropriate characters.
