Step 1: Remove unnecessary includes

The program includes several unnecessary header files such as `cmath`, `cstdio`, `cstring`, `iostream`, `map`, `queue`, `set`, `stack`, and `string`. Since these header files are not used in the program, they can be removed to improve compilation time and reduce memory usage.

Step 2: Remove unused macros

The program defines two macros `mul_mod` and `add_mod`, but they are not used anywhere in the code. Therefore, these macros can be removed to simplify the code.

Step 3: Optimize the sorting

The program sorts the array `A` using `std::sort` function. However, since we only need to find the maximum `n` elements of the array, we can use a partial sorting algorithm instead of sorting the entire array. This can be done using `std::nth_element` function. This optimization reduces the time complexity of the sorting operation from O(m log m) to O(m).

Step 4: Optimize the loop

The loop that calculates `temp` can be optimized by eliminating unnecessary calculations. The `temp` variable is calculated in two parts: the sum of `suf` and the additional terms. However, we can avoid calculating `suf` for each iteration of the loop by pre-calculating it once outside the loop. This optimization reduces the time complexity of the loop from O(m) to O(1).

Step 5: Optimize the search

The program uses `std::lower_bound` function to perform a binary search on the sorted array `A`. However, since `A` is already sorted, we can use a simple linear search instead of a binary search to find the position of `f[i].b` in `A`. This optimization reduces the time complexity of the search operation from O(log m) to O(1).

Here is the optimized C++ program:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

typedef long long ll;

const int maxn = 2e5 + 10;

int main() {
  int q;
  cin >> q;

  while (q--) {
    int n, m;
    cin >> n >> m;

    vector<pair<ll, ll>> f(m);
    vector<ll> A(m);

    for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
      cin >> f[i].first >> f[i].second;
      A[i] = f[i].first;
    }

    nth_element(A.begin(), A.begin() + n, A.end(), greater<ll>());

    ll suf = 0;
    for (int i = n; i < m; i++) {
      suf += A[i];
    }

    ll ans = suf;

    for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
      ll temp = 0;
      int pos = 0;
      for (int j = 0; j < m; j++) {
        if (A[j] == f[i].second) {
          pos = j;
          break;
        }
      }

      if (pos <= m - n) {
        continue;
      }

      temp += suf;

      int num = n - (m - pos);
      if (f[i].first < f[i].second) {
        temp += f[i].first;
        num--;
      }

      temp += num * f[i].second;
      ans = max(ans, temp);
    }

    cout << ans << endl;
  }

  return 0;
}
```

The optimized program removes unnecessary includes, macros, and uses partial sorting and linear search to optimize the time complexity of the program.
