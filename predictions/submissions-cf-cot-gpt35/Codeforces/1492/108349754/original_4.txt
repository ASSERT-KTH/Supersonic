The given program finds the maximum length of a substring in string `s` that is also a substring in string `t`. The program uses two arrays, `pos` and `pos2`, to store the positions of the matching substrings.

To optimize the program, we can eliminate the need for the `pos2` array by calculating the maximum length directly within the first loop. Instead of storing the positions of the matching substrings, we can keep track of the length of the current matching substring.

Here's the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int n, m;
  string s, t;
  cin >> n >> m >> s >> t;
  
  int ans = 0;
  int current_length = 0;
  for (int p1 = 0, p2 = 0; p1 < m; ++p1) {
    while (p2 < n && s[p2] != t[p1])
      p2++;
    
    if (p2 < n && s[p2] == t[p1]) {
      current_length++;
      ans = max(ans, current_length);
      p2++;
    }
  }
  
  cout << ans;
  return 0;
}
```

In the optimized program, we remove the `pos` and `pos2` arrays and introduce a new variable `current_length` to keep track of the length of the current matching substring. Instead of storing the positions, we update the `ans` variable whenever a longer matching substring is found. By doing this, we eliminate the need for the second loop and reduce the memory usage.
