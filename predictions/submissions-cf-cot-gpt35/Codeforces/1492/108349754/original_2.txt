Step 1: Remove unnecessary includes
- The line `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` includes a lot of unnecessary headers. We can remove it and include only the necessary headers, such as `iostream` and `string`.

Step 2: Optimize the loop
- In the first loop, we can optimize it by using the `find` function of the `string` class instead of manually iterating through characters.
- Instead of using `p2` to keep track of the current position in `s`, we can use the return value of `find` to directly get the position of the character in `s`.

Step 3: Optimize the second loop
- Similar to the first loop, we can optimize the second loop by using the `rfind` function of the `string` class instead of manually iterating through characters.
- Instead of using `p2` to keep track of the current position in `s`, we can use the return value of `rfind` to directly get the position of the character in `s`.

Step 4: Optimize the calculation of `ans`
- Instead of iterating from `0` to `m - 1` and calculating the difference between `pos2[i + 1]` and `pos[i]`, we can iterate from `m - 2` to `0` and calculate the difference between `pos[i]` and `pos2[i + 1]`.
- This way, we can avoid the subtraction operation and directly calculate the difference.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

const int maxn = 200000 + 5;
int pos[maxn];
int pos2[maxn];

int main() {
  int n, m;
  string s, t;
  cin >> n >> m >> s >> t;

  int p2 = -1;
  for (int p1 = 0; p1 < m; ++p1) {
    p2 = s.find(t[p1], p2 + 1);
    pos[p1] = p2;
  }

  p2 = n;
  for (int p1 = m - 1; p1 >= 0; --p1) {
    p2 = s.rfind(t[p1], p2 - 1);
    pos2[p1] = p2;
  }

  int ans = 0;
  for (int i = m - 2; i >= 0; --i) {
    ans = max(ans, pos[i] - pos2[i + 1]);
  }

  cout << ans;

  return 0;
}
```
