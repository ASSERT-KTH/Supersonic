The given program finds the longest substring in s that is a subsequence of t. It does this by iterating over t and finding the corresponding positions in s where each character of t occurs.

Here are the optimizations that can be made to improve the running time and memory usage:

1. Eliminate unnecessary includes: The program includes the entire `<bits/stdc++.h>` library, which is not recommended. We can remove this include statement and include only the necessary headers (`<iostream>` and `<string>`).

2. Avoid using namespace std: Instead of using `using namespace std;`, it is better to prefix the standard library classes and functions with `std::`.

3. Optimize the initializations of p1 and p2: Instead of initializing p1 and p2 to 0, we can directly initialize them to m-1 and n-1 respectively, as they are later used in a decrementing loop.

4. Improve the while loops: The inner while loops in both sections of the program can be replaced with if statements. Since we are only interested in finding the next occurrence of t[p1] in s, we don't need to continue searching if we find a match. We can break out of the loop as soon as we find a match.

5. Optimize the memory usage of pos2: The original program uses an array pos2 of size maxn to store the positions of the last occurrence of each character in t in s. However, we only need to store the positions for the characters in t that occur in s. We can use a map or unordered_map to store the positions dynamically and reduce the memory usage.

6. Optimize the final loop: The loop that calculates the maximum length of the substring can start from index 0 instead of 1 to avoid out of bounds access in pos and pos2 arrays.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <unordered_map>

int main() {
  int n, m;
  std::string s, t;
  std::cin >> n >> m >> s >> t;

  int p1 = m - 1, p2 = n - 1;
  std::unordered_map<char, int> pos2;
  
  while (p1 >= 0) {
    if (s[p2] == t[p1]) {
      pos2[t[p1]] = p2;
      p1--;
    }
    p2--;
  }

  int ans = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
    if (pos2.find(t[i]) != pos2.end()) {
      ans = std::max(ans, pos2[t[i]] - i + 1);
    }
  }

  std::cout << ans;

  return 0;
}
```

Explanation of optimizations:

1. Removed unnecessary includes to reduce compile time and avoid including unnecessary libraries.

2. Avoided using namespace std to prevent potential naming conflicts and improve code readability.

3. Initialized p1 and p2 directly to m-1 and n-1 respectively as they are used in decrementing loops.

4. Replaced the inner while loops with if statements to break out of the loop as soon as a match is found.

5. Used an unordered_map to dynamically store the positions of the last occurrence of each character in t in s. This reduces the memory usage compared to using an array of size maxn.

6. Modified the final loop to start from index 0 instead of 1 to avoid out of bounds access in pos and pos2 arrays.
