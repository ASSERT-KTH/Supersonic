This program is implementing a disjoint-set data structure to answer queries about the connected components of a graph. The optimization steps I would suggest are as follows:

1. Remove unnecessary headers: The program includes several unnecessary headers that are not used in the code. Removing these headers can improve compile time and reduce memory usage.

2. Remove unnecessary macros: The program defines several unnecessary macros that are not used in the code. Removing these macros can improve code readability and reduce memory usage.

3. Replace unordered_map with vector: The program uses unordered_map to store the parent and rank information for each element. However, since the elements are integers in the range [1, N], we can use a vector instead, which can be more efficient in terms of memory usage and lookup time.

4. Optimize the get function: The get function uses recursion to find the root of the set. This can lead to stack overflow for large input sizes. We can optimize this function by using path compression, which flattens the tree structure by making each node point directly to the root.

5. Optimize the unite function: The unite function can be optimized by using union by rank. By always attaching the smaller tree to the root of the larger tree, we can ensure that the depth of the tree remains small, which improves the performance of the get function.

6. Use a custom struct instead of unordered_map for mp: The mp map is used to store the results of previous queries. Instead of using an unordered_map, we can define a custom struct that stores the results for each pair of elements. This can reduce memory usage and improve lookup time.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

struct DSU {
    vector<int> parent;
    vector<int> rank;
    
    DSU(int n) {
        parent.resize(n + 1);
        rank.resize(n + 1);
        
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            parent[i] = i;
            rank[i] = 0;
        }
    }
    
    int find(int x) {
        if (parent[x] != x) {
            parent[x] = find(parent[x]);
        }
        return parent[x];
    }
    
    void unite(int x, int y) {
        x = find(x);
        y = find(y);
        
        if (x == y) {
            return;
        }
        
        if (rank[x] < rank[y]) {
            parent[x] = y;
        } else {
            parent[y] = x;
            if (rank[x] == rank[y]) {
                rank[x]++;
            }
        }
    }
};

struct Query {
    int a;
    int b;
    int result;
    
    Query(int a, int b) : a(a), b(b), result(0) {}
};

int main() {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0);
    cin.tie(0);
    cout.tie(0);
    
    int n, m;
    cin >> n >> m;
    
    DSU dsu(n);
    
    for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
        int a, b, c;
        cin >> a >> b >> c;
        dsu.unite(a, b);
    }
    
    int q;
    cin >> q;
    
    vector<Query> queries;
    
    while (q--) {
        int a, b;
        cin >> a >> b;
        
        if (a > b) {
            swap(a, b);
        }
        
        queries.push_back(Query(a, b));
    }
    
    for (Query& query : queries) {
        if (query.result != 0) {
            cout << query.result << '\n';
            continue;
        }
        
        int res = 0;
        
        if (dsu.find(query.a) == dsu.find(query.b)) {
            res++;
        }
        
        query.result = res;
        cout << res << '\n';
    }
    
    return 0;
}
```

Explanation of the optimization steps:

1. I removed the unnecessary headers to reduce memory usage and improve compile time.

2. I removed the unnecessary macros to improve code readability.

3. I replaced the unordered_map with a vector for the parent and rank arrays. This reduces memory usage and improves lookup time.

4. I optimized the get function by implementing path compression. This flattens the tree structure and reduces the depth of the tree, improving runtime.

5. I optimized the unite function by implementing union by rank. This ensures that the smaller tree is always attached to the root of the larger tree, which keeps the depth of the tree small and improves runtime.

6. I replaced the unordered_map used for mp with a custom struct. This reduces memory usage and improves lookup time.
