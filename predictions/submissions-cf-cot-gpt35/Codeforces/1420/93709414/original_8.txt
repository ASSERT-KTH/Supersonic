Step 1: Remove unnecessary includes
- The program includes `<bits/stdc++.h>`, which is a non-standard library and includes all the standard C++ libraries. This can have a negative impact on compilation time and memory usage.
- We can remove this line and include only the necessary standard libraries.

Step 2: Remove unnecessary macros
- The program defines a lot of macros which are not used in the code.
- We can remove these macros to simplify the code and improve readability.

Step 3: Optimize the power functions
- The program includes three power functions: `powerm`, `power`, and `powerNeg`.
- These functions use recursion, which can be inefficient for large exponents.
- We can optimize these functions to use iterative approach instead of recursion.

Step 4: Optimize the loop to calculate the answer
- The program uses two nested loops to calculate the answer: one loop to iterate over the array and another loop to calculate the sum.
- We can optimize this by calculating the answer in a single loop without using an additional vector.

Here's the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int powerm(int base, int exp, int mod) {
    int res = 1;
    base %= mod;
    while (exp > 0) {
        if (exp & 1)
            res = (res * base) % mod;
        base = (base * base) % mod;
        exp = exp >> 1;
    }
    return res;
}

int main() {
    ios::sync_with_stdio(0);
    cin.tie(0);
    cout.tie(0);
    
    int T;
    cin >> T;
    
    while (T--) {
        int n, q;
        cin >> n >> q;
        
        vector<int> a(n);
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            cin >> a[i];
        }
        
        int ans = 0;
        int i = 0;
        while (i < n) {
            while (i + 1 < n && a[i] < a[i + 1])
                i++;
            ans += a[i];
            while (i + 1 < n && a[i] > a[i + 1])
                i++;
            ans -= a[i];
            i++;
        }
        
        cout << ans << endl;
    }
    
    return 0;
}
```

Explanation of optimizations:
- We removed the unnecessary includes to reduce the compilation time and memory usage.
- We removed the unnecessary macros to simplify the code and improve readability.
- We optimized the power functions to use an iterative approach instead of recursion.
- We optimized the loop to calculate the answer in a single loop without using an additional vector.
