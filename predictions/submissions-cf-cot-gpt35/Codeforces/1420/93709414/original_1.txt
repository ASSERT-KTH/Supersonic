The given program is a C++ program that reads an integer `n` and an integer `q` from the input. Then it reads `n` integers into an array `a`. It then performs some operations on the array `a` and computes the value of `ans`. Finally, it prints the value of `ans`.

To optimize the program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove the unnecessary includes: The program includes `<bits/stdc++.h>` which includes a lot of unnecessary headers. We can remove this include statement and only include the necessary headers like `<iostream>` and `<vector>`.
2. Remove the unnecessary macros: The program defines a lot of unnecessary macros like `int long long`, `ld long double`, etc. We can remove these macros as they are not used in the program.
3. Remove the unnecessary typedefs: The program uses `typedef` to define some data types like `pii`, `vi`, etc. We can remove these typedefs and use the actual types directly.
4. Remove the unnecessary functions: The program defines some unnecessary functions like `power`, `powerNeg`, etc. We can remove these functions as they are not used in the program.
5. Remove the unnecessary code: The program contains some unnecessary code like the debugging functions `__print`, `_print`, and `dbg`. We can remove these functions as they are not used in the program.
6. Optimize the loop: The program uses a `while` loop to process the elements of the array `a`. We can optimize this loop by using a `for` loop instead.

Here is the optimized C++ program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

void solve() {
  int n, q;
  cin >> n >> q;
  vector<int> a(n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> a[i];
  }
  int ans = 0;
  vector<int> x;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    while (i + 1 < n && a[i] < a[i + 1]) {
      i++;
    }
    x.push_back(a[i]);
    while (i + 1 < n && a[i] > a[i + 1]) {
      i++;
    }
    x.push_back(a[i]);
  }
  for (int i = 0; i < x.size() - 1; i++) {
    if (i & 1) {
      ans -= x[i];
    } else {
      ans += x[i];
    }
  }
  cout << ans << endl;
}

int main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(0);
  cin.tie(0);
  cout.tie(0);
  int T;
  cin >> T;
  for (int t = 1; t <= T; t++) {
    solve();
  }
  return 0;
}
```
