Step 1: Remove unnecessary header files and macros.

The program includes the header file `<bits/stdc++.h>`, which is not a standard C/C++ header file. It is not recommended to use this header file as it includes all the standard library headers, which can increase the compile time and memory usage. Instead, we can include the specific header files that are required.

The program also defines several macros that are not used in the code. These macros can be removed to simplify the code.

Step 2: Remove unused functions.

The program defines several functions (`powerm`, `power`, `powerNeg`, `modinv`) that are not used in the `solve` function. These functions can be removed to reduce the memory usage.

Step 3: Optimize the loop for calculating the answer.

The current implementation uses two loops to iterate over the elements of the array `x` and calculate the answer. We can optimize this by using a single loop and a variable to keep track of the sign of the current element.

Step 4: Remove unnecessary variable declarations.

The program declares the variables `i` and `j` at the beginning of the `solve` function, but they are not used in the function. These variable declarations can be removed to reduce the memory usage.

Step 5: Remove unnecessary vector resizing.

The program uses the `PB` macro to push elements into the vector `x`. This macro calls the `push_back` function, which may resize the vector if necessary. We can optimize this by reserving the required size for the vector `x` before the loop.

Step 6: Remove unnecessary comments.

The program contains several commented lines that are not necessary for understanding the code. These comments can be removed to improve readability.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

void solve() {
  int n, q;
  cin >> n >> q;
  vector<int> a(n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> a[i];
  }
  
  int ans = 0;
  vector<int> x;
  x.reserve(n);
  
  int sign = 1;
  for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
    if (a[i] < a[i + 1]) {
      x.push_back(a[i]);
    } else {
      x.push_back(a[i]);
      ans += sign * a[i];
      sign = -sign;
    }
  }
  
  x.push_back(a[n - 1]);
  ans += sign * a[n - 1];
  
  cout << ans << endl;
}

int main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(0);
  cin.tie(0);
  cout.tie(0);
  
  int T;
  cin >> T;
  
  for (int t = 0; t < T; t++) {
    solve();
  }
  
  return 0;
}
```

Explanation:

1. Removed the unnecessary header files and macros.
2. Removed the unused functions.
3. Optimized the loop for calculating the answer.
4. Removed the unnecessary variable declarations.
5. Reserved the required size for the vector `x` before the loop.
6. Removed the unnecessary comments.
