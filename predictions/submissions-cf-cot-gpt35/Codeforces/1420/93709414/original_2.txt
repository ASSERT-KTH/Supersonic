Step 1: Remove unnecessary includes and preprocessor directives.

The original program includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header, which is not a standard C++ header and is considered bad practice. It is recommended to include only the necessary headers. In this case, we can remove the `<bits/stdc++.h>` include.

The preprocessor directives `#define int long long` and `#define ld long double` are unnecessary because they are not used in the program. We can remove them as well.

Step 2: Remove unnecessary macros.

The program defines a lot of macros that are not used. We can remove them to simplify the code.

Step 3: Remove unnecessary print functions.

The program defines a set of print functions that are not used. We can remove them to reduce unnecessary code.

Step 4: Use `const` instead of `#define` for constants.

The program uses `#define` to define constants like `mod` and `inf`. It is better to use `const` instead of `#define` for defining constants in C++. We can replace `#define mod 1000000007` with `const int mod = 1000000007` and `#define inf 1000000000000000000` with `const int64_t inf = 1000000000000000000`.

Step 5: Remove unused functions.

The program defines several functions that are not used, such as `power`, `powerNeg`, and `modinv`. We can remove these unused functions to simplify the code.

Step 6: Simplify the code.

The program uses multiple loops to iterate over the input array `a`. We can simplify the code by merging these loops into a single loop. Instead of using `while` loops, we can use a `for` loop with a step size of 2. This will eliminate the need for the `i` variable and the `x` vector.

Step 7: Optimize the calculation of the answer.

The program uses a loop to calculate the answer by iterating over the `x` vector. We can optimize the calculation by using a single loop and calculating the answer on the fly. Instead of using an `if` statement inside the loop, we can use the ternary operator to simplify the code.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    ios::sync_with_stdio(0);
    cin.tie(0);
    cout.tie(0);

    int T;
    cin >> T;

    for (int t = 0; t < T; t++) {
        int n, q;
        cin >> n >> q;

        vector<int> a(n);
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            cin >> a[i];
        }

        int ans = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i += 2) {
            if (a[i] < a[i + 1]) {
                ans += a[i + 1] - a[i];
            } else {
                ans -= a[i] - a[i + 1];
            }
        }

        cout << ans << endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```
