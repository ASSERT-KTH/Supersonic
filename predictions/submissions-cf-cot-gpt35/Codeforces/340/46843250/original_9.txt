The given program seems to be finding the number of unique elements in an array `a` using a multiset. Here are the steps to optimize the program:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The program includes the entire `<bits/stdc++.h>` library, which includes a lot of unnecessary headers. We can remove this line and include only the necessary headers.

2. Remove unnecessary macros: The program defines several macros that are not used. We can remove these macros.

3. Remove unnecessary typedefs: The program defines typedefs for `ll`, `ld`, `pii`, `vi`, `pll`, and `vll` which are not used. We can remove these typedefs.

4. Remove unnecessary functions: The program defines two unnecessary functions `gcd` and `pow`. We can remove these functions.

5. Avoid using `endl` for performance: The program uses `endl` to end the line, but this flushes the output stream which can be slow. We can replace `endl` with `'\n'` to only insert a newline character.

6. Remove unused variables: The program declares a few unused variables `MOD`, `MAXN`, `MINN`, `MOD2`, `INF`, and `EPS`. We can remove these variables.

7. Simplify the loop: The loop in the `Main` function can be simplified by using a range-based for loop instead of a traditional for loop.

8. Optimize insertion and deletion in the multiset: The program uses `s.lower_bound(a[i])` to check if an element already exists in the multiset and then erase and insert accordingly. This can be optimized by using `s.insert()` directly as it will automatically handle duplicates.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <set>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

int main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(0);
  cin.tie(0);

  int n;
  cin >> n;

  vector<int> a(n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    cin >> a[i];

  set<int> s;
  for (int num : a)
    s.insert(num);

  cout << s.size() << '\n';

  return 0;
}
```
