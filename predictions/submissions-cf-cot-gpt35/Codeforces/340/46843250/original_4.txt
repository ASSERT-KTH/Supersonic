The given program is a C++ program that takes an input `n`, followed by `n` integers, and then prints the number of unique integers among the input numbers.

To optimize the program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary header files: The program includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header file, which includes a lot of unnecessary header files. We can remove this line and include only the necessary header files.

2. Remove unnecessary macros: The program defines several macros that are not used. We can remove these macros to simplify the code.

3. Use `unordered_set` instead of `multiset`: The program uses a `multiset` to store the unique integers. However, we only need to count the number of unique integers, so we can use an `unordered_set` instead, which has a constant time complexity for insertion and lookup.

4. Remove unused variables and functions: The program defines several variables and functions that are not used. We can remove these unused variables and functions to simplify the code.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_set>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(nullptr);

  int n;
  cin >> n;

  unordered_set<int> s;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    int x;
    cin >> x;
    s.insert(x);
  }

  cout << s.size() << endl;

  return 0;
}
```
