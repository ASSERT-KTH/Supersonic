Step 1: Remove unnecessary headers
- The program includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header, which is not necessary and can be replaced with specific headers that are actually needed.

Step 2: Remove unnecessary macros
- The program defines macros like `pb`, `Mp`, `F`, `S`, `all`, `Sort`, `sz`, `debug`, `endl`. These macros are not used in the program and can be removed.

Step 3: Remove unnecessary typedefs
- The program defines typedefs for `ll`, `ld`, `pii`, `vi`, `pll`, `vll`, `str`. These typedefs are not used in the program and can be removed.

Step 4: Remove unnecessary functions
- The program defines functions like `gcd`, `mod`, `pow`. These functions are not used in the program and can be removed.

Step 5: Remove unnecessary constants
- The program defines constants like `MOD`, `MAXN`, `MINN`, `MOD2`, `INF`, `EPS`. These constants are not used in the program and can be removed.

Step 6: Simplify variable names
- The program uses variable names like `a`, `s`, `n`, `it`. These names can be simplified to make the code more readable.

Step 7: Optimize the algorithm
- The program uses a multiset to store the elements and then inserts and erases elements as needed. This can be improved by using a vector and performing binary search to find the insertion point and then updating the element at that position.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(0);
  cin.tie(0);

  int n;
  cin >> n;
  vector<int> arr(n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    cin >> arr[i];
  
  vector<int> s;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    auto it = lower_bound(s.begin(), s.end(), arr[i]);
    if (it != s.end())
      *it = arr[i];
    else
      s.push_back(arr[i]);
  }

  cout << s.size();

  return 0;
}
```
