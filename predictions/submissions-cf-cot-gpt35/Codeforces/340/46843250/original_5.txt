To optimize the given C++ program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The program includes `<bits/stdc++.h>` which is a non-standard header and includes a large number of headers. We can remove this line and include only the necessary headers.

2. Remove unnecessary macros: The program defines several macros that are not used. We can remove these macros to improve the readability of the code.

3. Replace `endl` with `"\n"`: The `endl` manipulator flushes the output stream, which can be an expensive operation. We can replace it with `"\n"` to improve the performance.

4. Remove unused variables and functions: The program defines several variables and functions that are not used. We can remove them to improve the efficiency of the program.

5. Use a vector instead of a multiset: The program uses a multiset to store and process the input elements. However, we can achieve the same functionality using a vector, which has a lower memory usage and faster access time.

Here is the optimized C++ program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(nullptr);
  
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  
  vector<int> a(n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    cin >> a[i];
  
  vector<int> s;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    auto it = lower_bound(s.begin(), s.end(), a[i]);
    if (it != s.end())
      s.erase(it);
    s.insert(it, a[i]);
  }
  
  cout << s.size() << "\n";
  
  return 0;
}
```

Explanation of the optimizations:

1. We removed the unnecessary includes and included only the necessary headers (`iostream` and `vector`).

2. We removed the unused macros to improve the readability of the code.

3. We replaced `endl` with `"\n"` to avoid the expensive operation of flushing the output stream.

4. We removed the unused variables (`q`) and functions (`gcd`, `mod`, `pow`).

5. We replaced the `multiset` with a `vector` to reduce memory usage and improve access time. Instead of using the `lower_bound` and `insert` functions of the `multiset`, we use the `lower_bound` function of the `vector` to find the position where the element should be inserted. We then use the `insert` function of the `vector` to insert the element at the correct position.
