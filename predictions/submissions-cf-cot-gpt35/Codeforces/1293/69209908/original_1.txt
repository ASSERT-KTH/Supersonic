Optimization Steps:

1. Remove unnecessary header file inclusion: The program includes `<bits/stdc++.h>` which is a non-standard header file and includes multiple other header files. This can lead to longer compilation times and unnecessary code bloat. We can remove this and include only the necessary header files.

2. Remove unused macros: The program defines macros that are not used. We can remove these macros to reduce unnecessary code.

3. Avoid unnecessary variable redefinition: The program redefines the variable `tx` inside the loop, which is unnecessary and can lead to confusion. We can rename the loop variable to avoid this redefinition.

4. Optimize the loop conditions: The loop conditions can be optimized to reduce unnecessary checks. Currently, the loop condition checks for `vs == 1` or `(vs == 2 && dist(tx, temp) <= t)`. We can simplify this by using a single condition `vs <= 2 && dist(tx, temp) <= t`.

5. Optimize the loop iteration: The loop iterates over the entire `arr` vector using indices. This can be optimized by using an iterator-based loop instead.

6. Optimize the loop body: The loop body calculates the distance `dus` multiple times unnecessarily. We can calculate the distance once and reuse it in the loop body.

7. Optimize the loop termination condition: The loop termination condition can be optimized to reduce unnecessary checks. Currently, the loop checks for `j < arr.size() - 1`, we can simplify this to `j < arr.size()` and adjust the loop body accordingly.

8. Use a more efficient data structure: The program uses a vector `arr` to store the intermediate points. However, a vector requires dynamic memory allocation and resizing, which can be inefficient. We can use a deque instead, which provides efficient insertion and deletion at both ends.

Optimized Program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <deque>
#include <utility>
#include <cmath>

#define ll long long

using namespace std;

ll xx, yy, ax, bx, ay, by, xs, ys, t;

ll dist(pair<ll, ll> a, pair<ll, ll> b) {
  return abs(a.first - b.first) + abs(a.second - b.second);
}

pair<ll, ll> next(pair<ll, ll> temp) {
  return make_pair(ax * temp.first + bx, ay * temp.second + by);
}

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(0);
  cout.tie(0);
  cin >> xx >> yy >> ax >> ay >> bx >> by >> xs >> ys >> t;
  
  pair<ll, ll> temp, tx;
  deque<pair<ll, ll>> arr;
  
  ll vs = 0;
  temp = make_pair(xx, yy);
  tx = make_pair(xs, ys);
  ll dea = dist(temp, tx);
  
  if (dea <= t)
    arr.push_back(temp);
  
  temp = next(temp);
  
  if (dist(tx, temp) > dea)
    vs = 2;
  else
    vs = 1;
  
  while (vs <= 2 && dist(tx, temp) <= t) {
    dea = dist(tx, temp);
    arr.push_back(temp);
    temp = next(temp);
    if (vs == 1 && dea < dist(tx, temp))
      vs = 2;
  }
  
  ll ans = 0;
  
  for (auto it = arr.begin(); it != arr.end(); it++) {
    auto jt = it;
    ll dus = dist(tx, *it);
    ll tx_dus = dus;
    
    if (dus <= t) {
      while (jt != arr.end() && dus <= t) {
        jt++;
        dus += dist(*jt, *(jt - 1));
      }
      
      if (dus <= t)
        ans = max(ans, (ll)distance(it, jt) + 1);
      else
        ans = max(ans, (ll)distance(it, jt));
        
      dus = tx_dus;
      jt = it;
      
      while (jt != arr.begin() && dus <= t) {
        jt--;
        dus += dist(*jt, *(jt + 1));
      }
      
      if (dus <= t)
        ans = max(ans, (ll)distance(jt, it) + 1);
      else
        ans = max(ans, (ll)distance(jt, it));
    }
  }
  
  cout << ans;
}
```

Explanation:

1. Removed the unnecessary header files and unused macros.
2. Renamed the loop variable `tx` to `tx_dus` to avoid redefinition.
3. Optimized the loop condition to `vs <= 2 && dist(tx, temp) <= t`.
4. Optimized the loop iteration using iterator-based loop.
5. Calculated the distance `dus` once and reused it in the loop body.
6. Optimized the loop termination condition to `jt != arr.end()` and adjusted the loop body accordingly.
7. Replaced the vector `arr` with a deque for efficient insertion and deletion at both ends.
