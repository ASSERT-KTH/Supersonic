Step 1: Remove unnecessary headers
- The program includes several unnecessary headers, such as `<bits/stdc++.h>` and `<ext/pb_ds/assoc_container.hpp>`.
- These headers are not needed for the program and can be removed.

Step 2: Optimize the #include directive
- Instead of including the entire `std` namespace, we can include only the necessary headers from the `std` namespace.
- This helps reduce the compilation time and avoids potential naming conflicts.

Step 3: Remove unnecessary macros
- The program defines several unnecessary macros, such as `_CRT_SECURE_NO_WARNINGS`, `_USE_MATH_DEFINES`, and `INT_MAX`.
- These macros are not used in the program and can be removed.

Step 4: Remove unnecessary using directives
- The program includes the `__gnu_pbds` namespace, which is not used in the code.
- This using directive can be removed.

Step 5: Remove unnecessary typedefs and aliases
- The program defines unnecessary typedefs and aliases, such as `int long long`, `ll long long`, and `ld long double`.
- These typedefs and aliases are not used in the program and can be removed.

Step 6: Remove unnecessary functions and macros
- The program defines several unnecessary functions and macros, such as `pb`, `pp`, `mi`, `mii`, `rall`, `tolower`, `toupper`, `rep`, and `repj`.
- These functions and macros are not used in the program and can be removed.

Step 7: Optimize the loop condition
- The program uses a loop from `s - 1010` to `s + 1010` to check for the minimum distance.
- However, this loop can be optimized by only iterating from `max(1, s - 1010)` to `min(n, s + 1010)`.
- This reduces the number of iterations and improves the running time.

Step 8: Remove unnecessary constant variables
- The program defines two unnecessary constant variables, `hell` and `mod`.
- These variables are not used in the program and can be removed.

Step 9: Remove unnecessary input/output redirection
- The program includes unnecessary input/output redirection code, which is not needed for the optimization.
- This code can be removed.

Here's the optimized C++ program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

typedef vector<long long> vi;

long long solve() {
  long long n, s, k;
  cin >> n >> s >> k;
  vi a(k);
  for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) cin >> a[i];
  long long cnt = INT_MAX;
  sort(a.begin(), a.end());
  for (int i = max(1LL, s - 1010); i <= min(n, s + 1010); i++) {
    if (!binary_search(a.begin(), a.end(), i))
      cnt = min(cnt, abs(s - i));
  }
  cout << cnt;
  return 0;
}

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(0);
  cout.tie(0);
  int t = 1;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    solve();
    cout << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```
