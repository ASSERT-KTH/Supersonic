Step 1: Remove unnecessary headers

The program includes several unnecessary headers that are not used in the code. We can remove these headers to improve the compile time and reduce memory usage.

Step 2: Remove unnecessary macros

The program defines several macros that are not used in the code. We can remove these macros to improve readability and reduce memory usage.

Step 3: Use standard data types

The program uses "ll" as the data type for variables, but it can be replaced with the standard data types such as "int" and "long long" to improve readability and reduce memory usage.

Step 4: Simplify loop conditions

The loop condition in the "solve" function can be simplified to only iterate from s - 1010 to s + 1010, instead of checking if i is within the range of 1 to n. This will reduce the number of iterations and improve runtime performance.

Step 5: Remove unnecessary output statements

The "solve" function prints the result of cnt, but according to the given code, the program should only print the result once in the "main" function. We can remove the cout statement inside the "solve" function.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <cmath>

using namespace std;

int solve() {
  int n, s, k;
  cin >> n >> s >> k;
  vector<int> a(k);
  for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
    cin >> a[i];
  }
  int cnt = INT_MAX;
  sort(a.begin(), a.end());
  for (int i = s - 1010; i <= s + 1010; i++) {
    if (binary_search(a.begin(), a.end(), i) == false) {
      cnt = min(cnt, abs(s - i));
    }
  }
  return cnt;
}

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(0);
  cout.tie(0);
  int t = 1;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    int result = solve();
    cout << result << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized program removes unnecessary headers, macros, and simplifies the code to improve runtime performance and reduce memory usage.
