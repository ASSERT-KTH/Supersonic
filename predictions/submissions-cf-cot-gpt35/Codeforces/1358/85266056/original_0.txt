Step 1: Remove unnecessary includes
- There are several unnecessary includes in the program, such as `<algorithm>`, `<chrono>`, `<cmath>`, `<cstring>`, `<iomanip>`, `<iostream>`, `<list>`, `<map>`, `<numeric>`, `<queue>`, `<set>`, `<sstream>`, `<stack>`, `<string>`, `<unordered_map>`, `<unordered_set>`.
- These includes are not used in the program and can be removed to reduce unnecessary overhead.

Step 2: Optimize the `getSum` function
- The `getSum` function calculates the sum of numbers from 1 to `n` using the formula `n * (n + 1) / 2`.
- This can be optimized by using a bitwise shift operation instead of multiplication and division.
- The optimized version of the function would be `n * (n + 1) >> 1`.

Step 3: Optimize the loop to calculate prefix sum
- The loop that calculates the prefix sum of the `u` vector can be optimized by removing the unnecessary addition of the previous element.
- Instead of adding `u[i - 1]` to `u[i]`, we can directly calculate `u[i]` using `u[i] += v[i]`.

Step 4: Optimize the loop to calculate cumulative sum
- The loop that calculates the cumulative sum of the `z` vector can be optimized by using the prefix sum array `u` instead of calculating the sum from scratch.
- Instead of calculating `z[i] = v[i] * (v[i] + 1) / 2` and then adding `z[i - 1]` to `z[i]`, we can directly calculate `z[i]` using `z[i] = z[i - 1] + u[i]`.

Step 5: Optimize the main loop
- The main loop can be optimized by removing unnecessary calculations and variables.
- Instead of calculating the sum of elements from `s` to `e` every time, we can update the sum by subtracting the value at `s` and adding the value at `e`.
- Instead of calculating the sum of numbers from `1` to `diff` every time, we can update the sum by subtracting the sum of numbers from `1` to `diff - 1`.
- Instead of using a separate variable `sums` to store the sum of numbers, we can use `ans` directly to store the maximum sum.

Step 6: Optimize the use of vectors
- Instead of creating a copy of the `v` vector in the `u` vector, we can directly use the `v` vector to calculate the prefix sum.
- Instead of creating a separate vector `z` to store the cumulative sum, we can directly update the `v` vector to store the cumulative sum.
- This will reduce the memory usage and eliminate the need for additional vector operations.

Optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

long long getSum(long long n) { return n * (n + 1) >> 1; }

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);

  long long n, x;
  cin >> n >> x;
  
  vector<long long> v(n);
  for (long long i = 0; i < n; i++)
    cin >> v[i];
    
  for (long long i = 1; i < n; i++) {
    v[i] += v[i - 1];
  }
  
  long long ans = 0;
  int s = 0, e = 0;
  long long days = 0;
  
  while (e < n) {
    days += v[e];
    e++;
    
    while (days > x) {
      if (days - v[s] < x) {
        break;
      }
      days -= v[s];
      s++;
    }
    
    long long diff = max(days - x, 0LL);
    ans = max(ans, v[e - 1] - (diff > 0 ? v[s - 1] : 0));
  }
  
  cout << ans;
  return 0;
}
```
