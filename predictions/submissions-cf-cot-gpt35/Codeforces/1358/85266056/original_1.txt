Step 1: Eliminate unnecessary header files
The program includes several header files that are not used. We can remove them to improve the compilation time and reduce memory usage.

Step 2: Remove unnecessary vector duplication
The program duplicates the input vector `v` and stores it in another vector `u`. This duplication is not necessary and can be removed.

Step 3: Use prefix sums to calculate cumulative sums
The program uses a loop to calculate cumulative sums of the vector `u`. This can be optimized by using prefix sums. We can calculate the cumulative sums in O(1) time for each element by adding the previous element.

Step 4: Use prefix sums to calculate cumulative sums of squares
The program uses a loop to calculate cumulative sums of squares of the vector `v`. This can also be optimized by using prefix sums. We can calculate the cumulative sums of squares in O(1) time for each element by adding the previous element.

Step 5: Use sliding window technique to find the maximum sum within a range
The program uses nested loops to find the maximum sum within a range. This can be optimized by using the sliding window technique. We can maintain two pointers, `s` and `e`, to represent the start and end of the window. We can slide the window by moving the `e` pointer forward and adjust the `s` pointer accordingly to keep the sum within the desired range.

Step 6: Calculate the maximum sum of squares using the sliding window technique
The program calculates the maximum sum of squares by subtracting the sum of squares within a range from the total sum of squares. We can optimize this calculation by using the sliding window technique. We can maintain two pointers, `s` and `e`, to represent the start and end of the window. We can slide the window by moving the `e` pointer forward and adjust the `s` pointer accordingly to keep the sum within the desired range.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

long long getSum(long long n) { return n * (n + 1) / 2; }

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);

  long long n, x;
  cin >> n >> x;

  vector<long long> v(n);
  for (long long i = 0; i < n; i++)
    cin >> v[i];

  long long ans = 0;
  int s = 0, e = 0;
  long long days = 0, sums = 0, sumsquares = 0;

  while (e < n) {
    days += v[e];
    sums += getSum(v[e]);
    sumsquares += v[e] * (v[e] + 1) * (2 * v[e] + 1) / 6;
    e++;

    while (days > x) {
      days -= v[s];
      sums -= getSum(v[s]);
      sumsquares -= v[s] * (v[s] + 1) * (2 * v[s] + 1) / 6;
      s++;
    }

    long long diff = max(days - x, 0LL);
    ans = max(ans, sums - getSum(diff) + sumsquares - getSum(diff) * diff);
  }

  cout << ans;

  return 0;
}
```
The optimized program eliminates unnecessary header files, removes unnecessary vector duplication, uses prefix sums to calculate cumulative sums and cumulative sums of squares, and uses the sliding window technique to find the maximum sum within a range and the maximum sum of squares within a range. These optimizations improve the running time and memory usage of the program.
