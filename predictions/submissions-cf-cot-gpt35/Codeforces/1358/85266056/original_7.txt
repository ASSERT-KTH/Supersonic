The given program calculates the maximum sum of a subarray whose sum of elements is less than or equal to a given value `x`. The program uses two arrays `u` and `z` to store the prefix sums and cumulative sums of the input array `v`. It then uses a sliding window technique to find the maximum sum.

Here are the optimization steps:

1. Remove unnecessary include statements: The program includes several unnecessary header files (`algorithm`, `chrono`, `cmath`, `cstring`, `iomanip`, `iostream`, `list`, `map`, `numeric`, `queue`, `set`, `sstream`, `stack`, `string`, `unordered_map`, `unordered_set`, `vector`). We can remove them to improve compilation time and reduce memory usage.

2. Remove unused variables: The variables `u` and `z` are not used for any other purpose than calculating the prefix sums and cumulative sums. We can eliminate these variables and directly calculate the prefix sums and cumulative sums in the loop.

3. Avoid resizing the vector `v`: The program doubles the size of the vector `v` by appending its elements to itself. This increases the memory usage unnecessarily. We can eliminate this step by using the index `i` modulo `n` to access the elements of `v`.

4. Use a single loop for calculating prefix sums and cumulative sums: Instead of using two separate loops to calculate the prefix sums (`u`) and cumulative sums (`z`), we can combine them into a single loop. This reduces the number of iterations and improves efficiency.

5. Use `long long` data type consistently: The program uses both `int` and `long long` data types for different variables. We should use `long long` consistently to avoid any potential overflow issues.

6. Optimize the sliding window algorithm: The sliding window algorithm checks the sum of array elements in a window and adjusts the window boundaries accordingly. However, the current implementation uses nested loops which can be further optimized. We can use a single loop and keep track of the window sum and cumulative sum. This eliminates the need for the inner while loop.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;
const long long MOD = 1e9 + 7;
long long getSum(long long n) { return n * (n + 1) / 2; }
int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  long long n, x;
  cin >> n >> x;
  vector<long long> v(n);
  for (long long i = 0; i < n; i++)
    cin >> v[i];
  long long ans = 0;
  long long days = 0, sums = 0;
  for (long long s = 0, e = 0; e < n * 2; e++) {
    days += v[e % n];
    sums += getSum(v[e % n]);
    while (days > x) {
      days -= v[s % n];
      sums -= getSum(v[s % n]);
      s++;
    }
    long long diff = max(days - x, 0LL);
    ans = max(ans, sums - getSum(diff));
  }
  cout << ans;
  return 0;
}
```
