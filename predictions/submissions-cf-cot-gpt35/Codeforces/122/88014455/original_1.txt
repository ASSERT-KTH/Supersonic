Step 1: Remove unnecessary includes and definitions

The code includes the header file `<bits/stdc++.h>`, which includes a large number of standard library header files. This can slow down the compilation process and increase memory usage. We can remove this include and include only the necessary header files.

The code also defines several macros that are not used in the program. We can remove these macros to make the code cleaner.

Step 2: Optimize the loop

The loop in the `solve` function checks if the input number is divisible by any of the divisors. However, the divisors are hardcoded in an array. We can optimize this loop by using a mathematical property: a number is divisible by 4 if and only if the last two digits of the number are divisible by 4, and a number is divisible by 7 if and only if the difference between the number formed by the last digit and the number formed by the remaining digits is divisible by 7. Using this property, we can reduce the loop to a single check for divisibility by 4 and 7.

Step 3: Remove unnecessary code

The code includes some unnecessary code, such as the `nl` variable and the `_min` and `_max` functions. We can remove these unnecessary code to make the program cleaner.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

bool isDivisibleBy4(int n) {
  return (n % 100) % 4 == 0;
}

bool isDivisibleBy7(int n) {
  int lastDigit = n % 10;
  int remainingDigits = n / 10;
  return (remainingDigits - 2 * lastDigit) % 7 == 0;
}

void solve() {
  int n;
  cin >> n;

  if (isDivisibleBy4(n) || isDivisibleBy7(n)) {
    cout << "YES\n";
  } else {
    cout << "NO\n";
  }
}

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);

#ifdef APAN
  freopen("input.txt", "r", stdin);
  freopen("output.txt", "w", stdout);
#endif

  solve();

  return 0;
}
```
