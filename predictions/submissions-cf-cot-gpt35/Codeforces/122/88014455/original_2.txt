The given C++ program can be optimized in the following steps:

1. Remove unnecessary include statements: The program includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header, which is not a standard C++ header and includes all other standard headers. This can increase the compile time and memory usage. We can remove this header and include only the necessary headers.

2. Remove unnecessary macros: The program defines several macros that are not used in the code. These macros can be safely removed.

3. Remove unnecessary using statement: The program includes the `using namespace std;` statement, which imports all the names from the `std` namespace into the global namespace. This can lead to potential naming conflicts and is generally considered a bad practice. We can remove this statement and prefix the standard library names with `std::` where necessary.

4. Use `constexpr` instead of `const` for compile-time constants: The program defines the `divisors` array, which is a compile-time constant. We can use the `constexpr` keyword to indicate this and potentially improve performance.

5. Use a more efficient algorithm: The program currently uses a brute force approach to check if the input number is divisible by any of the divisors. We can optimize this by using the modulo operator `%` to directly check for divisibility.

Here is the optimized C++ program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

constexpr int divisors[] = {4, 7, 44, 47, 74, 77, 444, 447, 474, 477, 744, 747, 774, 777};

bool isDivisible(int n) {
    for (int i = 0; i < 14; i++) {
        if (n % divisors[i] == 0) {
            return true;
        }
    }
    return false;
}

int main() {
    std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    std::cin.tie(NULL);

    int n;
    std::cin >> n;

    if (isDivisible(n)) {
        std::cout << "YES\n";
    } else {
        std::cout << "NO\n";
    }

    return 0;
}
```

Explanation of optimization steps:

1. Removed unnecessary include statements: Removed `<bits/stdc++.h>` and added the necessary headers `<iostream>` and `<vector>`.

2. Removed unnecessary macros: Removed the unused macros `ll`, `ld`, `fio`, `vi`, `pi`, `For`, `mp`, `pb`, `I`, `reg`, `R`, `cr`, `nl`, `_min`, `_max`.

3. Removed unnecessary using statement: Removed the `using namespace std;` statement.

4. Used `constexpr` for compile-time constants: Changed the `divisors` array to be `constexpr` since it is a compile-time constant.

5. Used a more efficient algorithm: Replaced the brute force approach with a more efficient algorithm that checks for divisibility using the modulo operator `%`. This eliminates the need for the `_min` and `_max` functions.
