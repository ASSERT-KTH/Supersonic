Step 1: Remove unnecessary headers
The program includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header, which includes a lot of unnecessary headers. We can remove this line and include only the necessary headers, such as `<iostream>` and `<vector>`.

Step 2: Remove unnecessary macros
The program defines several macros that are not used. We can remove the macros `ll`, `ld`, `vi`, `pi`, `I`, `reg`, `R`, `cr`, `nl`, `_min`, and `_max`.

Step 3: Remove unnecessary namespace
The program uses the `using namespace std` directive, which can lead to naming conflicts. It is better to remove this line and use the `std::` prefix when necessary.

Step 4: Remove unnecessary function inlining
The program defines the `_min` and `_max` functions as inline functions. However, these functions are not used in the program. We can remove the inline keyword.

Step 5: Optimize the divisors array
The program checks if the input number is divisible by any of the numbers in the `divisors` array. However, we can optimize this check by observing that the array contains numbers that are either all 4s or all 7s. We can simplify the check by checking if the input number only contains the digits 4 and 7. If it does, we output "YES", otherwise, we output "NO".

Step 6: Simplify the output statements
The program uses `cout` to output "YES" or "NO". We can simplify this by using a single `cout` statement with a ternary operator.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

void solve() {
  long long n;
  std::cin >> n;

  bool valid = true;
  while (n > 0) {
    int digit = n % 10;
    if (digit != 4 && digit != 7) {
      valid = false;
      break;
    }
    n /= 10;
  }

  std::cout << (valid ? "YES" : "NO") << std::endl;
}

int main() {
  std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  std::cin.tie(NULL);

#ifdef APAN
  freopen("input.txt", "r", stdin);
  freopen("output.txt", "w", stdout);
#endif

  solve();

  return 0;
}
```
