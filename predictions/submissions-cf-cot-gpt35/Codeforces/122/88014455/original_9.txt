Step 1: Remove unnecessary header files and macros

The `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` includes a large number of standard library headers, which is unnecessary and can slow down the compilation process. We can replace it with the specific header files that are actually needed.

The `#define` macros for `ll`, `ld`, `fio`, `vi`, `pi`, `For`, `mp`, `pb`, `I`, `reg`, `R`, `cr`, `_min`, `_max` are not used in the program. We can remove them to simplify the code.

Step 2: Optimize the loop

The loop in the `solve()` function iterates over the `divisors` array, checking if `n` is divisible by each divisor. However, we can optimize this process by checking if `n` is divisible by 4 or 7 first. If it is, we can then check if it is divisible by 44, 47, 74, 77, and so on. This will reduce the number of divisions performed.

Step 3: Remove unnecessary variables

The `pi` variable is not used in the program. We can remove it to simplify the code.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

bool isDivisible(ll n) {
  if (n % 4 == 0 || n % 7 == 0) {
    if (n % 44 == 0 || n % 47 == 0 || n % 74 == 0 || n % 77 == 0) {
      return true;
    }
  }
  return false;
}

int main() {
  ll n;
  cin >> n;

  if (isDivisible(n)) {
    cout << "YES" << endl;
  } else {
    cout << "NO" << endl;
  }

  return 0;
}
```
