Step 1: Remove unnecessary headers.

The `<bits/stdc++.h>` header is not necessary and can be replaced with specific headers that are actually used in the program.

Step 2: Remove unused macros.

The macros `ll`, `ld`, `vi`, `pi`, `I`, `reg`, `R`, and `cr` are not used in the program and can be removed.

Step 3: Use more descriptive variable names.

The variable name `n` can be changed to something more descriptive, like `number`.

Step 4: Optimize the loop.

Instead of iterating over all 14 divisors, we can optimize the loop by checking only the divisors that are less than or equal to the square root of the input number. This will reduce the number of iterations.

Step 5: Remove unnecessary function calls.

The functions `_min` and `_max` are not used in the program and can be removed.

Here is the optimized C++ program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <cmath>

using namespace std;

vector<int> divisors = {4, 7, 44, 47, 74, 77, 444, 447, 474, 477, 744, 747, 774, 777};

void solve() {
  int number;
  cin >> number;
  
  int sqrtNumber = sqrt(number);
  
  for (int i = 0; i < divisors.size(); i++) {
    if (divisors[i] <= sqrtNumber && number % divisors[i] == 0) {
      cout << "YES\n";
      return;
    }
  }
  
  cout << "NO\n";
}

int main() {
  solve();
  return 0;
}
```
