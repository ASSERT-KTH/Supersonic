Step 1: Remove unnecessary header files

The program includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header file, which includes a lot of unnecessary headers. We can remove this line and include only the necessary headers.

Step 2: Remove unnecessary macros

The program contains several unnecessary macros, such as `ll`, `ld`, `vi`, `pi`, `For`, `mp`, `pb`, `I`, `reg`, `R`, and `cr`. We can remove these macros to simplify the code.

Step 3: Simplify function definitions

The program defines two inline functions `_min` and `_max`, which can be replaced with the built-in `min` and `max` functions from the `<algorithm>` header. We can also remove the `solve()` function definition and move its code directly into the `main()` function.

Step 4: Optimize the loop

The program uses a loop to check if the input number `n` is divisible by any of the elements in the `divisors` array. However, we can optimize this by sorting the `divisors` array in descending order and using the `std::lower_bound` function to find the first element in the array that is less than or equal to `n`. If this element is equal to `n`, then it is divisible by `n` and we can output "YES". Otherwise, we output "NO".

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>
#include <vector>

int main() {
    std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    std::cin.tie(NULL);

    std::vector<int> divisors = {777, 774, 747, 744, 477, 474, 447, 444, 77, 74, 47, 44, 7, 4};
  
    int n;
    std::cin >> n;
    
    if (std::binary_search(divisors.begin(), divisors.end(), n)) {
        std::cout << "YES\n";
    } else {
        std::cout << "NO\n";
    }
    
    return 0;
}
```

Explanation:

1. We removed the unnecessary header file `<bits/stdc++.h>` and included only the necessary headers `<iostream>`, `<algorithm>`, and `<vector>`.
2. We removed the unnecessary macros.
3. We replaced the inline functions `_min` and `_max` with the built-in `min` and `max` functions from the `<algorithm>` header.
4. We removed the `solve()` function definition and moved its code directly into the `main()` function.
5. We sorted the `divisors` array in descending order.
6. We used the `std::binary_search` function to search for `n` in the `divisors` array. This function returns `true` if `n` is found, and `false` otherwise.
