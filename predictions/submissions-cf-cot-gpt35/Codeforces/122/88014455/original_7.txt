Optimization Steps:
1. Remove unnecessary includes: The program includes the entire `bits/stdc++.h` library, which is not necessary. We can remove this include and only include the required headers.
2. Remove unused macros: The program defines several macros that are not used in the code. We can remove these macros to simplify the code.
3. Remove unnecessary typedefs: The program typedefs `ll` and `ld` but they are not used anywhere. We can remove these typedefs.
4. Remove unnecessary function calls: The program calls `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false)` and `cin.tie(NULL)` but these are not necessary for this program. We can remove these function calls.
5. Remove unnecessary variables: The program defines `vi` and `pi` but these variables are not used. We can remove these variable definitions.

Optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int divisors[] = {4, 7, 44, 47, 74, 77, 444, 447, 474, 477, 744, 747, 774, 777};

void solve() {
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  for (int i = 0; i < 14; i++) {
    if (n % divisors[i] == 0) {
      cout << "YES\n";
      return;
    }
  }
  cout << "NO\n";
}

int main() {
  solve();
  return 0;
}
```
