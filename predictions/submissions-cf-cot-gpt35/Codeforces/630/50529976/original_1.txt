The given program calculates the value of `ans` by iterating over a range of values from 1 to `2 * n - 2 - n + 1`. For each value of `i`, it checks if `i` is equal to 1 or `2 * n - 2 - n + 1`. Based on this check, it calculates a temporary value `temp` and adds it to `ans`.

To optimize the program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The program includes multiple unnecessary header files. We can remove `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` and `#include <stdio.h>` as they are not used.

2. Remove unnecessary macros: The program defines multiple unnecessary macros such as `LL`, `LD`, `ULL`, `pii`, `ump`, etc. We can remove these macros as they are not used.

3. Simplify the loop condition: The loop condition `i <= 2 * n - 2 - n + 1` can be simplified to `i <= n - 1` since `2 * n - 2 - n + 1` is equal to `n - 1`.

4. Simplify the temporary value calculation: The calculation of the temporary value `temp` can be simplified by using the `pow` function from the `<cmath>` header. Instead of using a loop to calculate `temp`, we can directly calculate it as `temp = pow(4, z) * ((i == 1 || i == n - 1) ? 3 : 9) * 4`.

5. Use a more efficient data type for `ans`: The variable `ans` is currently of type `LL`, which is a 64-bit integer. However, the maximum value of `ans` is within the range of a 32-bit integer. We can change the data type of `ans` to `int` to save memory.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>

using namespace std;

int main() {
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  
  int ans = 0;
  for (int i = 1; i <= n - 1; i++) {
    int z = 2 * n - 2 - n - (i == 1 || i == n - 1 ? 1 : 2);
    int temp = pow(4, z) * ((i == 1 || i == n - 1) ? 3 : 9) * 4;
    ans += temp;
  }
  
  cout << ans << endl;
  return 0;
}
```

The optimized program removes unnecessary includes and macros, simplifies the loop condition and temporary value calculation, and uses a more efficient data type for `ans`. These optimizations improve the program's running time and memory usage.
