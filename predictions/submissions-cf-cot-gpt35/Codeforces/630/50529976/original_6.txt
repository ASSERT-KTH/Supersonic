Step 1: Remove unnecessary includes

The program includes `<bits/stdc++.h>` and `<stdio.h>` which are not used in the code. We can remove these includes.

Step 2: Remove unnecessary macros

There are several macros defined in the code that are not used. We can remove these macros to simplify the code.

Step 3: Remove unnecessary functions

There are several inline functions defined in the code that are not used. We can remove these functions to simplify the code.

Step 4: Simplify the calculation of `ans`

The calculation of `ans` can be simplified by removing the unnecessary loops and calculations inside the loops.

Step 5: Simplify the loop condition

The loop condition `i <= 2 * n - 2 - n + 1` can be simplified to `i <= n - 1`.

Here is the optimized code:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  long long ans = 0;
  for (int i = 1; i <= n - 1; i++) {
    if (i == 1 || i == (n - 1)) {
      ans += 48;
    } else {
      ans += 144;
    }
  }
  cout << ans << endl;
  return 0;
}
```
