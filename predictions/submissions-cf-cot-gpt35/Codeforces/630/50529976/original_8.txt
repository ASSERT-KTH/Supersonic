Step 1: Remove unnecessary includes and macros.

The program includes a lot of unnecessary header files and defines macros that are not used in the code. Removing these will make the code cleaner and reduce the compile time.

Step 2: Remove unnecessary inline functions.

The program contains many inline functions that are not used in the code. Removing these will reduce the code size and improve readability.

Step 3: Optimize the calculation of "temp".

The calculation of "temp" inside the for loop can be optimized by using the power function instead of the while loop. This will reduce the number of iterations and improve the running time.

Step 4: Simplify the loop condition.

The loop condition in the for loop can be simplified to "i <= n - 1" instead of "i <= 2 * n - 2 - n + 1". This will make the code more readable and reduce the number of calculations.

Optimized code:

```
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

typedef long long int LL;

int main() {
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  LL ans = 0;
  for (int i = 1; i <= n - 1; i++) {
    if (i == 1 || i == n - 1) {
      LL temp = 1;
      int z = n - 2;
      temp = pow(4, z) * 3 * 4;
      ans += temp;
    } else {
      LL temp = 1;
      int z = n - 3;
      temp = pow(4, z) * 9 * 4;
      ans += temp;
    }
  }
  cout << ans << endl;
  return 0;
}
```
