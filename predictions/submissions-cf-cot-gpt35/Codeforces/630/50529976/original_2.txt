Step 1: Remove unnecessary includes

The program includes several unnecessary headers, such as `<bits/stdc++.h>` and `<stdio.h>`. These headers are not used in the program, so we can remove them to improve compilation time and reduce memory usage.

Step 2: Remove unused macros

The program defines several macros that are not used in the program, such as `S_SIZE`, `mx`, and `EPS`. We can remove these macros to simplify the code and reduce memory usage.

Step 3: Replace `printf` and `scanf` with `cout` and `cin`

The program uses `printf` and `scanf` for input/output operations. We can replace these with `cout` and `cin` to simplify the code and improve performance.

Step 4: Simplify the loop condition

The loop condition in the main loop can be simplified. Instead of `i <= 2 * n - 2 - n + 1`, we can simply write `i <= n - 1`. This improves readability and reduces the number of calculations in each iteration.

Step 5: Simplify the calculation of `temp`

The calculation of `temp` in each iteration of the loop can be simplified. Instead of using a loop to calculate the power of 4, we can use the `pow` function from the `<cmath>` library. This simplifies the code and improves performance.

Step 6: Use the `+=` operator instead of `ans = ans + temp`

The program uses `ans = ans + temp` to update the value of `ans` in each iteration of the loop. We can simplify this by using the `+=` operator, which is more concise.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  long long int ans = 0;
  for (int i = 1; i <= n - 1; i++) {
    if (i == 1 || i == n - 1) {
      long long int temp = pow(4, (2 * n - 2 - n - 1)) * 3 * 4;
      ans += temp;
    } else {
      long long int temp = pow(4, (2 * n - 2 - n - 2)) * 9 * 4;
      ans += temp;
    }
  }
  cout << ans << endl;
  return 0;
}
```
