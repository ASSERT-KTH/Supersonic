The given program calculates the value of `ans` using a nested loop. The outer loop iterates from `1` to `2*n-2-n+1`, and the inner loop calculates the value of `temp` by multiplying `4` a certain number of times. 

To optimize the program, we can eliminate the inner loop and directly calculate the value of `temp` using a mathematical formula. 

Let's denote `2*n-2-n+1` as `m`. 

For the first and last iteration of the outer loop (i.e., `i=1` and `i=m`), the value of `temp` can be calculated as follows:

```
temp = 1 * 3 * 4^(m-1)
```

For the rest of the iterations, the value of `temp` can be calculated as follows:

```
temp = 1 * 9 * 4^(m-2)
```

By using these formulas, we can calculate the value of `ans` without the need for the inner loop. This will significantly improve the running time of the program.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
#include <stdio.h>
using namespace std;
#define LL long long int
#define ULL unsigned long long int

int main() {
  int n;
  scanf("%d", &n);
  LL ans = 0;
  int m = 2*n - 2 - n + 1;
  
  // Calculate value of temp for first and last iteration
  LL temp = 1 * 3 * pow(4, m-1);
  ans += temp;
  
  // Calculate value of temp for rest of the iterations
  temp = 1 * 9 * pow(4, m-2);
  ans += (m-2) * temp;
  
  printf("%lld\n", ans);
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized program eliminates the inner loop and directly calculates the value of `temp` using mathematical formulas. The running time of the program is significantly improved.
