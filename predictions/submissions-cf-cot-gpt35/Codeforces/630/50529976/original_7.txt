The given program calculates the value of `ans` using nested loops. The outer loop iterates from 1 to `2 * n - 2 - n + 1`, and the inner loop calculates the value of `temp` based on the value of `i`. There are two cases, one for `i = 1` or `i = 2 * n - 2 - n + 1` and another for all other values of `i`. The value of `ans` is updated in each iteration.

To optimize the program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The program includes unnecessary headers `<bits/stdc++.h>` and `<stdio.h>`. We can remove them as they are not used in the program.

2. Remove unused macros: The program defines several macros that are not used in the code. We can remove them to reduce the clutter.

3. Remove unnecessary function definitions: The program defines several inline functions that are not used. We can remove them to simplify the code.

4. Simplify loop conditions: The condition `2 * n - 2 - n + 1` can be simplified to `n - 1`. We can modify the outer loop condition accordingly.

5. Remove unnecessary calculations: The program calculates the value of `temp` in each iteration of the inner loop. However, the value of `temp` depends only on the value of `n` and does not change within the loop. We can calculate `temp` once outside the loop and reuse it in each iteration.

6. Optimize the calculation of `temp`: The calculation of `temp` can be optimized by using the formula `temp = pow(4, z) * (i == 1 || i == (2 * n - 2 - n + 1) ? 3 : 9) * 4`. This avoids the need for a loop to calculate `temp`.

7. Use a more efficient algorithm: The current algorithm has a time complexity of O(n). We can optimize it to have a constant time complexity of O(1) by using the formula `ans = (pow(4, n - 2) * (3 + (n - 2) * 9)) * 4`.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>

using namespace std;

int main() {
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  
  long long ans = pow(4, n - 2) * (3 + (n - 2) * 9) * 4;
  
  cout << ans << endl;
  
  return 0;
}
```
