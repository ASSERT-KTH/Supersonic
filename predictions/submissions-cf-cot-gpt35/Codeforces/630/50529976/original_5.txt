The given program calculates the value of `ans` based on the value of `n`. It uses a loop to iterate from 1 to `2 * n - 2 - n + 1` and performs some calculations based on the value of `i`. 

Here are the optimization steps:
1. Remove unnecessary includes: The program includes several unnecessary headers that are not being used. We can remove them to improve compile time and reduce memory usage.
2. Remove unnecessary macros: The program defines several macros that are not being used. We can remove them to simplify the code and reduce memory usage.
3. Remove unnecessary using namespace: The program has a `using namespace std` statement which is not necessary since the program does not use any standard library functions directly. We can remove it to reduce memory usage.
4. Remove unnecessary function templates: The program defines several function templates that are not being used. We can remove them to simplify the code and reduce memory usage.
5. Remove unnecessary IO functions: The program defines several IO functions (I, OUT, O) that are not being used. We can remove them to simplify the code and reduce memory usage.
6. Simplify loop condition: The loop condition `2 * n - 2 - n + 1` can be simplified to `n - 1`. This will not change the behavior of the program but will make it more readable.
7. Simplify calculation of `ans`: The calculation of `ans` can be simplified. We can remove the inner while loop and replace it with a single multiplication by a constant value. This will significantly reduce the number of iterations in the loop and improve the runtime of the program.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <cstdio>

int main() {
  int n;
  scanf("%d", &n);
  long long ans = 0;
  for (int i = 1; i <= n - 1; i++) {
    if (i == 1 || i == n - 1) {
      ans += 48;
    } else {
      ans += 144;
    }
  }
  printf("%lld\n", ans);
  return 0;
}
```
