Step 1: Remove unnecessary headers

The program includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header, which includes almost all standard headers. This can slow down the compilation time and increase memory usage. Since the program does not use all the included headers, we can remove it and include only the necessary headers.

Step 2: Optimize the set data structure

The program uses a set data structure to store the positions of each character in the string. However, the current implementation uses 27 sets (one for each character) which can be optimized. We can use a single set to store the positions of all characters and use an array to keep track of the count of each character. This will reduce memory usage and improve performance.

Step 3: Optimize the lower_bound() function

The current implementation uses the lower_bound() function to find the first position greater than or equal to a given value. However, this function has a time complexity of O(log n) and can be optimized. Since the positions are stored in a set, we can use the upper_bound() function instead, which has the same time complexity but returns the first position strictly greater than a given value. This will avoid unnecessary comparisons and improve performance.

Step 4: Avoid unnecessary calculations

The program calculates the length of the input string using strlen() function multiple times. We can avoid this by calculating it once and storing it in a variable.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <set>
using namespace std;

const int bbn = 200005;
const int mod = 1000000007;
typedef long long int LL;

set<int> se;
int count[26] = {0};
char s[bbn];

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);

  cin >> (s + 1);
  int q;
  cin >> q;
  int len = strlen(s + 1);

  for (int i = 1; i <= len; i++) {
    se.insert(i);
    count[s[i] - 'a']++;
  }

  while (q--) {
    int x;
    cin >> x;
    if (x == 1) {
      int p;
      char c;
      cin >> p >> c;
      se.erase(p);
      se.insert(p);
      count[s[p] - 'a']--;
      count[c - 'a']++;
      s[p] = c;
    } else if (x == 2) {
      int l, r, sum = 0;
      cin >> l >> r;
      for (int i = 0; i < 26; i++) {
        auto p = se.upper_bound(l - 1);
        if (p != se.end() && *p <= r && *p - l + 1 <= count[i])
          sum++;
      }
      cout << sum << endl;
    }
  }
}
```
