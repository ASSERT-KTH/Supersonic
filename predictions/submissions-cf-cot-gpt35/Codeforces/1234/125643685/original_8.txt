The given program reads a string and performs two types of queries on it. The first type of query updates a character at a given position in the string, while the second type of query counts the number of distinct characters in a given substring.

To optimize this program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Replace the `set` container with a `vector` of `unordered_set` containers to reduce memory usage. Since the size of the alphabet is fixed at 26, we can use an array of `unordered_set` containers instead of a set of sets. This will eliminate the need for dynamic memory allocation and improve cache locality.

2. Maintain a separate count of distinct characters for each substring. Instead of iterating over all the `unordered_set` containers for each query of type 2, we can maintain a separate count of distinct characters for each substring. We can use an array to store the count of distinct characters for each position in the string.

3. Use a more efficient method to count distinct characters in a substring. Instead of iterating over all the `unordered_set` containers, we can use the count of distinct characters for each position to calculate the count of distinct characters in a given substring. We can do this by subtracting the count of distinct characters at the start of the substring from the count of distinct characters at the end of the substring.

4. Avoid unnecessary calculations. In the original program, the length of the string is calculated using `strlen` function for each query of type 2. We can calculate the length of the string once before the queries start and reuse it.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
#define bbn 200005
#define mod 1000000007
typedef long long int LL;
using namespace std;

unordered_set<int> se[27];
char s[bbn];
int distinctCount[bbn];

int main() {
  cin >> s + 1;
  int q;
  cin >> q;
  int len = strlen(s + 1);

  for (int i = 1; i <= len; i++) {
    se[s[i] - 'a'].insert(i);
  }

  for (int i = 1; i <= len; i++) {
    distinctCount[i] = distinctCount[i-1] + (se[s[i] - 'a'].find(i) != se[s[i] - 'a'].end());
  }

  while (q--) {
    int x;
    cin >> x;
    if (x == 1) {
      int p;
      char c;
      cin >> p >> c;
      se[s[p] - 'a'].erase(p);
      se[c - 'a'].insert(p);
      s[p] = c;
    } else if (x == 2) {
      int l, r;
      cin >> l >> r;
      int sum = distinctCount[r] - distinctCount[l-1];
      cout << sum << endl;
    }
  }
}
```

Explanation of the optimizations:

1. Replacing the `set` container with a `vector` of `unordered_set` containers reduces memory usage. Instead of dynamically allocating memory for each `set`, we use an array of `unordered_set` containers, which eliminates the overhead of dynamic memory allocation and improves cache locality.

2. Maintaining a separate count of distinct characters for each position in the string (`distinctCount` array) allows us to efficiently calculate the count of distinct characters in a given substring. By using an array, we can directly access the count of distinct characters at any position, eliminating the need to iterate over all the `unordered_set` containers.

3. Calculating the count of distinct characters in a given substring by subtracting the count at the start from the count at the end improves efficiency. Instead of iterating over all the `unordered_set` containers for each query of type 2, we can use the precalculated count of distinct characters to obtain the count for a given substring. This reduces the time complexity from O(26) to O(1) for each query of type 2.

4. Calculating the length of the string once before the queries start and reusing it avoids unnecessary calculations. In the original program, the length of the string is calculated using the `strlen` function for each query of type 2. By calculating the length once and storing it in a variable (`len`), we avoid the overhead of repeatedly calculating the length.

These optimizations improve the running time and memory usage of the program.
