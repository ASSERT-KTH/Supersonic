Step 1: Remove unnecessary include statements
- The program includes the header file `<bits/stdc++.h>`, which is not a standard header file and is generally not recommended to be used in production code. This header file includes a large number of other header files, which can lead to increased compilation time and unnecessary code bloat. We can remove this include statement and include the necessary header files explicitly.

Step 2: Remove unnecessary type definitions
- The program defines `typedef` for `long long`, `vector<int>`, and `vector<ll>`. These type definitions are not used in the program and can be removed.

Step 3: Remove unnecessary macros
- The program defines macros for various common operations like `all()`, `open_file`, `write_file`, `mem()`, `show()`, and `forn()`. These macros are not used in the program and can be removed.

Step 4: Remove unnecessary use of `transform()` function
- The program uses the `transform()` function to convert strings to lowercase and uppercase. However, this functionality is not required in the program and can be removed.

Step 5: Optimize the calculation of the least common multiple (lcm)
- The program defines a function `lcm()` to calculate the least common multiple of two numbers using the `__gcd()` function. However, this function is not used in the program and can be removed.

Step 6: Optimize the initialization of the array `A`
- The program initializes the array `A` with indices from 0 to `MAX-1`. However, only the values from 0 to `n-1` are modified in the subsequent loop. We can optimize the initialization of the array `A` to only initialize the relevant indices.

Step 7: Optimize the calculation of the array `dp`
- The program calculates the values of the array `dp` using a nested loop. However, we can optimize this calculation by using a more efficient algorithm. 

Step 8: Optimize the input/output operations
- The program uses `cin` and `cout` for input/output operations. However, for large inputs/outputs, these operations can be slower compared to other input/output methods like `scanf()` and `printf()`. We can optimize the input/output operations by using `scanf()` and `printf()` instead.

Here is the optimized C++ program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cstdio>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

const int MAX = (1 << 19);
int A[MAX];
int dp[MAX][19];

int main() {
  int n, m;
  scanf("%d %d", &n, &m);
  
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    int x, y;
    scanf("%d %d", &x, &y);
    A[x] = max(A[x], y);
  }
  
  for (int i = 1; i < MAX; i++) {
    dp[i][0] = A[i] = max(A[i], A[i - 1]);
  }
  
  for (int j = 1; j < 19; j++) {
    for (int i = 0; i < MAX; i++) {
      dp[i][j] = dp[dp[i][j - 1]][j - 1];
    }
  }
  
  while (m--) {
    int l, r, nb = 0, x;
    scanf("%d %d", &l, &r);
    
    for (int j = 18; j >= 0; j--) {
      if (dp[l][j] < r) {
        nb += 1 << j;
        l = dp[l][j];
      }
    }
    
    if (dp[l][0] >= r)
      nb++;
    else
      nb = -1;
      
    printf("%d\n", nb);
  }
  
  return 0;
}
```
