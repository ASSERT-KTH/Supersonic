To optimize the given C/C++ program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary header files: The program includes `<bits/stdc++.h>`, which includes a large number of standard library headers. We can remove this line and include only the necessary headers.

2. Remove unused typedefs: The program defines typedefs for `ll`, `vi`, and `vl`, but they are not used anywhere in the program. We can remove these typedefs.

3. Remove unused macros: The program defines macros for `all`, `open_file`, `write_file`, `mem`, `show`, and `forn`, but they are not used anywhere in the program. We can remove these macros.

4. Avoid using `std::endl`: The program uses `std::endl` to output a newline character, but it also flushes the output stream. This can be inefficient. We can replace `std::endl` with `'\n'` to only output a newline character without flushing the output stream.

5. Use `cin` and `cout` instead of `scanf` and `printf`: The program uses `scanf` and `printf` for input and output. While `scanf` and `printf` can be faster, using `cin` and `cout` can simplify the code and make it more readable. We can replace `scanf` with `cin` and `printf` with `cout`.

6. Optimize the loop conditions: The program uses nested loops with fixed loop conditions. We can optimize the loop conditions to avoid unnecessary iterations. Specifically, we can replace `i < n` with `i < MAX` in the first loop and replace `i < MAX` with `i < (1 << 19)` in the second loop.

7. Avoid unnecessary assignments: The program assigns `A[i]` to `dp[i][0]` in the second loop. Since `A[i]` is not used after this assignment, we can remove it to avoid unnecessary assignments.

8. Avoid unnecessary calculations: The program calculates `A[i] = max(A[i], A[i - 1])` in the second loop. Since the value of `A[i]` is already assigned in the first loop, we can remove this calculation to avoid unnecessary calculations.

9. Optimize the `while` loop condition: The `while` loop iterates `m` times, but the loop condition checks if `m` is greater than or equal to zero in each iteration. We can optimize the loop condition to check if `m` is greater than zero before entering the loop.

With these optimizations in mind, here is the optimized C/C++ program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <cmath>
#include <cstring>

using namespace std;

int const MAX = (1 << 19);
int A[MAX];
int dp[MAX][19];

int main() {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(nullptr);

    int n, m;
    cin >> n >> m;

    for (int i = 0; i < MAX; i++) {
        A[i] = i;
    }

    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        int x, y;
        cin >> x >> y;
        A[x] = max(A[x], y);
    }

    dp[0][0] = A[0];
    for (int i = 1; i < (1 << 19); i++) {
        dp[i][0] = A[i];
    }

    for (int j = 1; j < 19; j++) {
        for (int i = 0; i < MAX; i++) {
            dp[i][j] = dp[dp[i][j - 1]][j - 1];
        }
    }

    while (m > 0) {
        int l, r, nb = 0, x;
        cin >> l >> r;

        for (int j = 18; j >= 0; j--) {
            if (dp[l][j] < r) {
                nb += 1 << j;
                l = dp[l][j];
            }
        }

        if (dp[l][0] >= r) {
            nb++;
        } else {
            nb = -1;
        }

        cout << nb << '\n';

        m--;
    }

    return 0;
}
```
