To optimize the given C++ program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary headers: The `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` header includes a large number of standard library headers, which can significantly increase the compilation time and memory usage. Since the program does not use all of these headers, we can remove it and include only the necessary headers.

2. Remove unnecessary preprocessor directives: The `#pragma GCC optimize("O3")` directive is used to optimize the program with the highest level of optimization. However, this directive may not always result in the best performance, and it can also increase the binary size. We can remove this directive to rely on the default optimization level.

3. Replace `vector<ll>` with `vector<int>`: The program uses a vector of `ll` (long long) to store the input values. However, the input values are read as integers and there is no need to use a larger data type. We can replace `vector<ll>` with `vector<int>` to reduce memory usage.

4. Use `reserve` to allocate memory: The program uses `vector<ll> a(n)` to initialize the vector `a` with `n` elements. However, the actual number of elements read from the input may be smaller than `n`. We can use the `reserve` function to allocate memory for `n` elements in advance, but without constructing the objects. This can reduce memory usage.

5. Use a constant seed for `mt19937_64`: The program uses `mt19937_64 rnd(chrono::steady_clock::now().time_since_epoch().count())` to initialize the random number generator. However, generating the seed based on the current time can introduce unnecessary overhead. We can use a constant seed instead to ensure consistent behavior.

6. Replace `unordered_map` with `map`: The program uses an `unordered_map` to store the frequency of each value. However, since the values are small integers, a `map` can provide a more efficient implementation. We can replace `unordered_map<ll, int>` with `map<int, int>`.

7. Use prefix increment instead of postfix increment: The program uses postfix increment (`i++`) in the loop iterators. However, prefix increment (`++i`) can be more efficient, especially for user-defined types. We can replace `i++` with `++i` in the loop iterators.

Here is the optimized C++ program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <map>
#include <random>
using namespace std;

#define fastio ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0); cin.tie(0)
#define forn(i, n) for (int i = 0; i < int(n); ++i)

int main() {
  fastio;
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  vector<int> a;
  a.reserve(n);
  forn(i, n) {
    int x;
    cin >> x;
    a.push_back(x);
  }
  int m = n - n / 2;
  int res = 0;
  mt19937_64 rnd(42); // Use a constant seed
  forn(_, 13) {
    int x = a[rnd() % n], s, va, vb;
    map<int, int> d; // Use map instead of unordered_map
    d.max_load_factor(0.1);
    forn(i, n) {
      va = x, vb = a[i];
      while (vb != 0)
        s = va, va = vb, vb = s % vb;
      d[va]++;
    }
    for (auto &i : d) {
      int c = 0;
      for (auto &j : d)
        if (j.first % i.first == 0)
          c += j.second;
      if (c >= m && i.first > res)
        res = i.first;
    }
  }
  cout << res << endl;
  return 0;
}
```

By making these optimizations, we can improve the running time and reduce the memory usage of the program.
