First, let's analyze the given program and identify potential optimizations:

1. The program includes unnecessary headers. We can remove `<bits/stdc++.h>` and `<unordered_set>` since they are not used in the code.

2. The program uses a lot of unnecessary `memset` calls. We can remove these calls since the subsequent initialization of the arrays will overwrite the memory anyway.

3. The program uses a lot of unnecessary `memset` calls. We can remove these calls since the subsequent initialization of the arrays will overwrite the memory anyway.

4. The program uses an unnecessary `unordered_set` called `lol`. We can remove this set and use a simple `int` variable to keep track of the number of distinct elements.

5. The program uses a lot of unnecessary `vector` operations. We can remove these operations by using a simple counter variable.

6. The program uses an unnecessary `unordered_set` called `lol`. We can remove this set and use a simple `int` variable to keep track of the number of distinct elements.

7. The program uses an unnecessary `vector` called `kek`. We can remove this vector and use a simple counter variable.

8. The program uses an unnecessary `vector` called `kek2`. We can remove this vector and use a simple counter variable.

9. The program uses an unnecessary loop to check if an element is present in a set. We can remove this loop by using a `set` instead of an `unordered_set`.

10. The program unnecessarily updates the `f` and `f2` arrays in each iteration of the inner loop. We can move the updates outside the loop to avoid unnecessary updates.
