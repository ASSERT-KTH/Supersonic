To optimize the given program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The program includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header, which is not a standard C++ header and can slow down the compilation process. Instead, we can include only the necessary standard headers.

2. Remove unnecessary macros: The program defines multiple macros that are not used. We can remove these macros to improve readability.

3. Remove unnecessary typedefs: The program defines multiple typedefs that are not used. We can remove these typedefs to improve readability.

4. Avoid unnecessary copying and resizing: In the `remDup` function, the program sorts and then removes duplicates from a vector. However, it unnecessarily copies and resizes the vector multiple times. We can optimize this by using the `std::unique` function directly on the vector.

5. Use range-based for loops: In the `solve` function, the program uses nested for loops with indices to iterate over the adjacency list. We can simplify this by using range-based for loops.

6. Use `emplace_back` instead of `push_back`: In the `solve` function, the program uses `push_back` to add elements to vectors. However, `emplace_back` can be used instead to construct the element in-place without unnecessary copying.

7. Avoid unnecessary reverse: In the `solve` function, the program reverses the `ans` vector using `reverse(all(ans))`. However, we can avoid this by iterating over the `par` vector in reverse order.

With these optimizations in mind, here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

using ll = long long int;

const ll inf = 1e9 + 7;

void solve() {
    ll t1 = 1;
    for (ll tt = 1; tt <= t1; tt++) {
        int n, m, T;
        cin >> n >> m >> T;
        vector<vector<pair<int, int>>> adj(n + 1);
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            int u, v, w;
            cin >> u >> v >> w;
            adj[u].emplace_back(v, w);
        }
        vector<vector<int>> dp(n + 1, vector<int>(n + 1, inf));
        vector<vector<int>> par(n + 1, vector<int>(n + 1, -1));
        dp[1][1] = 0;
        vector<int> indc(n + 1, -1);
        for (int j = 1; j < n; j++) {
            for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
                for (auto& e : adj[i]) {
                    int to = e.first;
                    if (dp[to][j + 1] > dp[i][j] + e.second && dp[i][j] + e.second <= T) {
                        indc[to] = i;
                        dp[to][j + 1] = dp[i][j] + e.second;
                        par[to][j + 1] = i;
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        int res = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            if (dp[n][i] <= T) {
                res = i;
            }
        }
        vector<int> ans;
        int cur = n;
        int jumps = res;
        ans.push_back(cur);
        while (jumps > 1) {
            ans.push_back(par[cur][jumps]);
            cur = par[cur][jumps];
            jumps--;
        }
        cout << res << endl;
        for (int i : ans) {
            cout << i << " ";
        }
    }
}

int main() {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(NULL);
    cout.tie(NULL);
    solve();
    return 0;
}
