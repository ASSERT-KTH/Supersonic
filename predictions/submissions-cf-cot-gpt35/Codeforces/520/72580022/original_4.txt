To optimize the given C++ program, we can make the following changes:

1. Remove unnecessary header files: The program includes several unnecessary header files such as <algorithm>, <cmath>, <cstdio>, <cstdlib>, <ctime>, <deque>, <iomanip>, <iostream>, <map>, <queue>, <set>, <stack>, <stdexcept>, and <stdlib.h>. We can remove these header files as they are not used in the code.

2. Remove unnecessary macros: The program defines several unnecessary macros such as sf, sfl, sff, sffl, sfff, sfffl, ll (multiple times), my_sizeof, watch, all, per, rep, ppr, REP, vec, MAX, MIN, and endl. We can remove these macros as they are not used in the code.

3. Remove unnecessary includes: The program includes <string> and <vector> headers but does not use any functions or classes from these headers. We can remove these includes as they are not needed.

4. Optimize isprime function: The isprime function checks whether a number is prime or not. However, it is not used in the code. We can remove this function as it is not necessary.

5. Optimize input and output: The program uses the cin and cout objects for input and output. However, it also includes the open and Adnan functions, which are not used. We can remove these functions and use the standard input/output streams directly.

6. Simplify the logic for counting distinct characters: The program uses a map to count the frequency of each character in the input string. However, the logic can be simplified by using a set to store the distinct characters. We can then compare the size of the set with 26 to determine if all letters of the alphabet are present.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <set>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int n, c = 0;
  cin >> n;
  string s;
  cin >> s;

  set<char> distinctChars;
  for (char ch : s) {
    distinctChars.insert(tolower(ch));
  }

  if (distinctChars.size() == 26)
    cout << "YES";
  else
    cout << "NO";

  return 0;
}
```

Explanation of the optimization steps:

1. Removed unnecessary header files: The program did not use any functions or classes from these header files, so they were unnecessary and can be removed.

2. Removed unnecessary macros: The program did not use any of these macros, so they were unnecessary and can be removed.

3. Removed unnecessary includes: The program did not use any functions or classes from these header files, so they were unnecessary and can be removed.

4. Optimized isprime function: The isprime function was not used in the code, so it was unnecessary and can be removed.

5. Optimized input and output: The open and Adnan functions were not used in the code, so they were unnecessary and can be removed. We can use the standard input/output streams directly.

6. Simplified the logic for counting distinct characters: Instead of using a map to count the frequency of each character, we can use a set to store the distinct characters. By comparing the size of the set with 26, we can determine if all letters of the alphabet are present. This simplifies the logic and improves the performance.
