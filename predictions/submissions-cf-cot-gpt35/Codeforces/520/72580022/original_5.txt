The given program has a few areas that can be optimized:

1. Unnecessary includes: The program includes several unnecessary headers, such as `<cmath>`, `<cstdlib>`, and `<ctime>`. These headers are not used in the program and can be removed.

2. Unnecessary macros: The program defines several macros that are not used. These macros, such as `ll`, `gcd`, `lcm`, `my_sizeof`, and `watch`, can be removed.

3. Redundant function definition: The program defines the `isprime` function, but it is not used in the program. This function can be removed.

4. Unnecessary file operations: The program includes the `open` function, which opens an input and output file. However, these file operations are not used in the program. The `open` function and the `#ifndef ONLINE_JUDGE` block can be removed.

5. Unnecessary `using namespace std`: The program includes the `using namespace std` statement, which can lead to naming conflicts. It is better to avoid using this statement and explicitly specify the `std` namespace where necessary.

6. Unnecessary type redefinition: The program redefines the `ll` and `endl` types, which are already defined in the standard library. These redefinitions can be removed.

7. Inefficient loop iteration: The program uses a range-based for loop to iterate over the `mp` map. However, this loop creates a copy of the map elements, which can be inefficient. Using a reference-based for loop or a regular iterator-based loop can be more efficient.

Optimized program:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <map>
#include <string>

int main() {
  std::string s;
  int n, c = 0;
  std::cin >> n >> s;
  std::map<char, int> mp;
  for (char& ch : s) {
    ch = std::tolower(ch);
    mp[ch]++;
  }
  for (auto it = mp.begin(); it != mp.end(); ++it) {
    if (it->second >= 1)
      c++;
  }
  if (c == 26)
    std::cout << "YES";
  else
    std::cout << "NO";
  return 0;
}
```
