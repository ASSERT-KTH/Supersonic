Step 1: Remove unnecessary header files and macros.

- The program includes several unnecessary header files such as `<algorithm>`, `<cmath>`, `<cstdlib>`, `<ctime>`, `<deque>`, `<iomanip>`, `<queue>`, `<set>`, `<stack>`, `<stdexcept>`, and `<stdlib.h>`.
- The program includes several unnecessary macros such as `sf`, `sfl`, `sff`, `sffl`, `sfff`, `sfffl`, `ll`, `my_sizeof`, `watch`, `all`, `per`, `rep`, `ppr`, `REP`, `sz`, `vec`, `MAX`, `MIN`, `ll`, `endl`, and `pi`.

Step 2: Optimize the `isprime` function.

- The `isprime` function checks if a number is prime or not.
- The function currently checks if the number is less than 2 and if it is divisible by 2. These checks can be combined into a single condition: `if (n < 2 || n % 2 == 0)`.
- The function currently checks if the number is divisible by any odd number from 3 to the square root of the number. This can be optimized by checking only odd numbers from 3 to the square root of the number and skipping even numbers.

Step 3: Optimize the loop in the `main` function.

- The loop iterates over each character in the string `s` and converts it to lowercase using `tolower` function. This can be optimized by directly checking if the character is between 'a' and 'z' using `if (s[i] >= 'a' && s[i] <= 'z')`.
- The loop also counts the frequency of each character using a `map`. This can be optimized by using an array of size 26 to store the frequency of each character. The index of the array corresponds to the character - 'a'.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <map>
using namespace std;

bool isprime(int n) {
  if (n < 2 || n % 2 == 0)
    return false;
  for (int i = 3; i * i <= n; i += 2) {
    if (n % i == 0)
      return false;
  }
  return true;
}

int main() {
  string s;
  int n, c = 0;
  cin >> n >> s;
  int freq[26] = {0};
  for (int i = 0; i < s.size(); i++) {
    if (s[i] >= 'a' && s[i] <= 'z') {
      freq[s[i] - 'a']++;
    }
  }
  for (int i = 0; i < 26; i++) {
    if (freq[i] >= 1)
      c++;
  }
  if (c == 26)
    cout << "YES";
  else
    cout << "NO";
}
```
