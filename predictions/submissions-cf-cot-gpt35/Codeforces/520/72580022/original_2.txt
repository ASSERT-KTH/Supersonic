The given C/C++ program has a number of optimization opportunities:

1. Remove unnecessary header files: The program includes several unnecessary header files that are not used in the program. These include `<algorithm>`, `<cmath>`, `<deque>`, `<iomanip>`, `<queue>`, `<set>`, `<stack>`, `<stdexcept>`, and `<stdlib.h>`. We can remove these header files to reduce the compilation time and memory usage.

2. Remove unused macros: The program defines several macros that are not used anywhere. These macros include `sf`, `sfl`, `sff`, `sffl`, `sfff`, `sfffl`, `ll`, `my_sizeof`, `watch`, `all`, `per`, `rep`, `ppr`, `sz`, `vec`, `MAX`, `MIN`, `ll`, and `pi`. We can remove these unused macros to simplify the code and reduce memory usage.

3. Remove unused functions: The program defines two functions `gcd` and `lcm` that are not used anywhere. We can remove these unused functions to simplify the code and improve readability.

4. Optimize the `isprime` function: The `isprime` function checks whether a given number is prime. We can optimize this function by checking for divisibility only up to the square root of the number instead of checking all numbers up to the number itself. This optimization can significantly improve the performance of the function for large numbers.

5. Replace `map` with an array: The program uses a `map` to count the frequency of each character in the input string. However, since the input string contains only lowercase alphabets, we can use an array of size 26 to store the frequency of each character. This will simplify the code and improve performance.

6. Use `cout` instead of `printf`: The program uses `printf` and `scanf` for input/output operations. We can replace these with `cout` and `cin` for improved readability and ease of use.

Here is the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <map>
using namespace std;

bool isprime(int n) {
  if (n < 2)
    return false;
  if (n == 2)
    return true;
  if (n % 2 == 0)
    return false;
  for (int i = 3; i * i <= n; i += 2) {
    if (n % i == 0)
      return false;
  }
  return true;
}

int main() {
  string s;
  int n, c = 0;
  cin >> n >> s;
  int frequency[26] = {0};
  for (char ch : s) {
    ch = tolower(ch);
    frequency[ch - 'a']++;
  }
  for (int i = 0; i < 26; i++) {
    if (frequency[i] >= 1)
      c++;
  }
  if (c == 26)
    cout << "YES";
  else
    cout << "NO";
}
```

Explanation of optimizations:

1. Removed unnecessary header files.
2. Removed unused macros and functions.
3. Optimized the `isprime` function by checking divisibility only up to the square root of the number.
4. Replaced `map` with an array to store the frequency of each character in the input string.
5. Used `cout` and `cin` for input/output operations.
