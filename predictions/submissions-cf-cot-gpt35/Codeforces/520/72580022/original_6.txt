The given C++ program is used to check if a given string contains all the letters of the alphabet. The program counts the frequency of each letter in the string and checks if the count is equal to the number of distinct letters in the alphabet.

To optimize the program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary header files: The program includes several unnecessary header files like `<algorithm>`, `<cmath>`, `<cstdlib>`, `<ctime>`, `<deque>`, `<iomanip>`, `<map>`, `<queue>`, `<set>`, `<stack>`, `<stdexcept>`, and `<stdlib.h>`. These header files are not used in the program and can be removed.

2. Remove unnecessary macros: The program defines several unnecessary macros like `sf`, `sfl`, `sff`, `sffl`, `sfff`, `sfffl`, `ll`, `my_sizeof`, `watch`, `all`, `per`, `rep`, `ppr`, `REP`, `sz`, `vec`, `MAX`, `MIN`, `ll`, `endl`, and `pi`. These macros are not used in the program and can be removed.

3. Remove unnecessary functions: The program defines two unnecessary functions `gcd` and `lcm`. These functions are not used in the program and can be removed.

4. Remove unused variables: The program defines a variable `c` which is not used for any computation. This variable can be removed.

5. Optimize the loop: The program uses a loop to count the frequency of each letter in the string. Instead of iterating over the entire string, we can use the `set` container to store all the distinct letters in the string. By comparing the size of the `set` with the number of distinct letters in the alphabet, we can determine if the string contains all the letters.

6. Optimize the check for lowercase letters: The program converts each character of the string to lowercase using the `tolower` function. Instead, we can directly check if a character is a lowercase letter by comparing its ASCII value with the range of lowercase letters.

7. Optimize the check for prime numbers: The program defines a function `isprime` which checks if a number is prime. However, this function is not used in the program and can be removed.

Here is the optimized C++ program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <map>
#include <set>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  string s;
  int n;
  cin >> n >> s;

  set<char> distinctLetters;
  for (char c : s) {
    if (c >= 'a' && c <= 'z')
      distinctLetters.insert(c);
  }

  if (distinctLetters.size() == 26)
    cout << "YES";
  else
    cout << "NO";

  return 0;
}
```
