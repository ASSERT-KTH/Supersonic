Step 1: Remove unnecessary includes

The current program includes the `bits/stdc++.h` header, which includes a large number of standard library headers. This can increase the compilation time and may include unnecessary dependencies. Since the program does not use any specific headers from this included file, we can remove it.

Step 2: Remove unnecessary macros

The program defines two macros `int` and `rep`. These macros are not used in the program and can be removed.

Step 3: Optimize the `check` function

The `check` function is used to determine if a point `(x, y)` lies within a square of side length `l`. The implementation of the `check` function can be simplified by using the `abs` function instead of multiple comparisons. Additionally, we can remove the `if` statement and directly return the result of the condition.

Step 4: Optimize the `rep` loop

The `rep` macro is used to iterate over a range. However, the loop variable `i` is not used inside the loop. We can replace the `rep` macro with a regular `for` loop and remove the unused loop variable.

Step 5: Optimize the calculation of `c`

The variable `c` is calculated using the formula `c = 1 / sqrt(2 - 2 * cos(angle))`. This calculation can be simplified by combining the terms inside the `sqrt` function.

Step 6: Optimize the binary search loop

The binary search loop is used to find the minimum value of `m` such that all the points `(x, y)` lie within the square of side length `m`. The loop can be optimized by removing the unnecessary `r` variable and using the `m` variable directly in the `check` function.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <iomanip>
#include <cmath>

using namespace std;

bool check(double l, double x, double y) {
  double p = l / 2;
  return (abs(x) <= p && abs(y) <= p);
}

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(nullptr);
  
  cout << setprecision(9) << fixed;
  
  int ct;
  cin >> ct;
  
  while (ct--) {
    int n;
    cin >> n;
    
    double angle = (acos(-1) / n);
    double c = 1 / sqrt(2 - 2 * cos(angle));
    
    double l = 0, m = 200;
    
    for (int i = 0; i < 200; ++i) {
      m = (l + m) * 0.5;
      bool ok = true;
      
      for (int j = 0; j < 2 * n; ++j) {
        double x = c * cos(j * angle + acos(-1) / 4);
        double y = c * sin(j * angle + acos(-1) / 4);
        
        ok = check(m, x, y);
        
        if (!ok) {
          break;
        }
      }
      
      if (ok) {
        m = l;
      } else {
        l = m;
      }
    }
    
    cout << l << '\n';
  }
  
  return 0;
}
```
