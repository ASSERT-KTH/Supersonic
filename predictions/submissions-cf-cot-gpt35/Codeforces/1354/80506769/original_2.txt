The given program calculates the maximum radius of a circle that can fit inside a regular polygon with n sides. The program uses binary search to find the maximum radius by repeatedly checking if a circle with a certain radius can fit inside the polygon.

To optimize the program, we can make the following modifications:
1. Remove unnecessary includes: The program includes the entire `<bits/stdc++.h>` library, which is not necessary. We only need the `<iostream>` and `<iomanip>` libraries for input/output operations and formatting.
2. Remove unnecessary macros: The macros `int long long`, `rep`, and `IOS` are not used in the program and can be removed.
3. Pre-calculate constant values: The value of `pi` is calculated using the `acos` function in every iteration of the main loop. We can calculate it once outside the loop and reuse the value.
4. Optimize the `check` function: The `check` function checks if a given point (x, y) is inside a square with side length `l`. Instead of using multiple `if` conditions, we can use a single condition to check if the point lies within the range (-p, p) in both x and y coordinates. This will simplify the function and improve performance.
5. Optimize the main loop: The main loop iterates 200 times, which is not necessary. We can use a while loop instead and terminate the loop when the difference between the left and right boundaries is less than a small epsilon value.
6. Use `cout` instead of `printf`: The program uses `printf` for output, which can be replaced with `cout` for simplicity.

Here's the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <iomanip>
#include <cmath>
using namespace std;

bool check(double l, double x, double y) {
  double p = l / 2;
  return (x >= -p && x <= p && y >= -p && y <= p);
}

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);

  cout << setprecision(9) << fixed;

  int ct;
  cin >> ct;
  
  const double pi = acos(-1);
  
  while (ct--) {
    int n;
    cin >> n;

    double angle = (pi / n);
    double c = 1 / sqrt(2 - 2 * cos(angle));

    double l = 0, r = 200;
    
    while (r - l > 1e-9) {
      double m = (r + l) * 0.5;
      bool ok = true;
      
      for (int j = 0; j < 2 * n; ++j) {
        double x = c * cos(j * angle + pi / 4);
        double y = c * sin(j * angle + pi / 4);

        if (!check(m, x, y)) {
          ok = false;
          break;
        }
      }
      
      if (ok)
        r = m;
      else
        l = m;
    }
    
    cout << l << "\n";
  }
}
```

This optimized program reduces unnecessary includes, macros, and calculations. It also simplifies the check function and uses a more efficient termination condition for the main loop.
