This program calculates the minimum length of a substring in a given string such that the substring contains all three characters '1', '2', and '3'. The program uses a nested loop to find the next occurrence of each character for each position in the string. It then calculates the length of the substring starting from that position and updates the minimum length if necessary.

To optimize this program, I would suggest the following steps:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The program includes several unnecessary headers (algorithm, chrono, cmath, iostream, string, vector) that are not used. Removing these includes will reduce the compilation time and memory usage.

2. Remove unnecessary macros: The program defines several unnecessary macros that are not used. Removing these macros will improve code readability and reduce memory usage.

3. Remove unnecessary typedefs: The program defines several unnecessary typedefs that are not used. Removing these typedefs will improve code readability and reduce memory usage.

4. Remove unnecessary variable: The program defines a variable "len" inside the loop that is used only once to update the minimum length. Instead of using this variable, we can directly update the minimum length using the "ans" variable.

5. Optimize the nested loop: The program uses a nested loop to find the next occurrence of each character for each position in the string. This can be optimized by using a single loop and calculating the next occurrence for each character separately. This will reduce the number of iterations and improve the running time.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

#define INF (int)1e9

void solve() {
  string s;
  cin >> s;
  int n = s.size();
  int ans = INF;
  vector<vector<int>> next(n, vector<int>(4, -1));
  next[n - 1][s[n - 1] - '0'] = n - 1;
  for (int i = n - 2; i >= 0; i--) {
    next[i] = next[i + 1];
    next[i][s[i] - '0'] = i;
    if (next[i][1] != -1 && next[i][2] != -1 && next[i][3] != -1) {
      ans = min(ans, max({next[i][1], next[i][2], next[i][3]}) - i);
    }
  }
  if (ans == INF) {
    cout << 0 << endl;
  } else {
    cout << (ans + 1) << endl;
  }
}

int main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(0);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  cout.tie(NULL);
  solve();
}
```

This optimized program removes unnecessary includes, macros, and typedefs. It also removes the unnecessary variable "len" and optimizes the nested loop. These optimizations will improve the running time and reduce memory usage.
