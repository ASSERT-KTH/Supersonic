Step 1: Remove unnecessary includes
- In the given program, there are some unnecessary includes such as `<algorithm>`, `<cmath>`, and `<string>`. Since these headers are not being used in the program, we can remove them to improve compile time.

Step 2: Remove unnecessary macros
- The program defines a large number of macros that are not being used. We can remove these macros to simplify the code and improve readability.

Step 3: Remove unnecessary variable declarations
- The program declares some unnecessary variables such as `EPS`, `MOD`, `endl`, `V`, `db`, `ldb`, `pq`, `str`, `uint`, `ull`, `umap`, `uset`. Since these variables are not being used, we can remove them to reduce memory usage.

Step 4: Simplify loop conditions
- The loop condition `for (int i = (a); i < (b); i++)` can be simplified to `for (int i = a; i < b; i++)` for better readability.

Step 5: Optimize the loop iteration
- The loop `for (int i = n - 2; i >= 0; i--)` can be optimized by changing it to `for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++)`. This will simplify the loop and improve execution time.

Step 6: Simplify the if condition
- The if condition `if (s[i] == '1')` can be simplified by using a switch statement instead. This will make the code more readable and efficient.

Step 7: Remove unnecessary variable assignment
- The variable `len` can be assigned directly in the `min` function call, without assigning it separately. This will reduce the number of variables and improve memory usage.

Step 8: Simplify the output statement
- The output statement `cout << (ans + 1) << endl;` can be simplified to `cout << ans + 1 << '\n';` for better readability.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

void solve() {
  string s;
  cin >> s;
  int n = s.size();
  int ans = INT_MAX;
  vector<vector<int>> next(n, vector<int>(4, -1));
  next[n - 1][s[n - 1] - '0'] = n - 1;
  for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
    next[i] = next[i + 1];
    next[i][s[i] - '0'] = i;
    if (next[i][1] == -1 || next[i][2] == -1 || next[i][3] == -1) {
      continue;
    }
    int len;
    switch (s[i]) {
      case '1':
        len = max(next[i][2], next[i][3]) - i;
        break;
      case '2':
        len = max(next[i][1], next[i][3]) - i;
        break;
      default:
        len = max(next[i][1], next[i][2]) - i;
        break;
    }
    ans = min(ans, len);
  }
  if (ans == INT_MAX) {
    cout << 0 << '\n';
  } else {
    cout << ans + 1 << '\n';
  }
}

int main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(0);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  cout.tie(NULL);
  solve();
}
```

Note: Since the original program uses some macros and includes that are not being used, it is possible that these were left over from previous versions of the code or were included for future modifications. In such cases, it is always a good practice to remove unnecessary code to improve the overall efficiency and readability of the program.
