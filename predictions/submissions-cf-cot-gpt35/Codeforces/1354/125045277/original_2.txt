Optimization Steps:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The program includes several unnecessary headers such as `<algorithm>`, `<cmath>`, and `<string>`. These headers are not used in the program and can be removed to reduce memory usage.

2. Remove unnecessary macros: The program defines several unnecessary macros such as `EPS`, `MOD`, and `dbg`. These macros are not used in the program and can be removed to reduce memory usage.

3. Simplify variable types: The program uses various types such as `V`, `db`, `ldb`, `ll`, `pq`, `str`, `uint`, and `ull` as shortcuts. These shortcuts can be removed and the full variable types can be used instead to improve code readability.

4. Remove unnecessary comments: The program includes a comment `#pragma GCC optimize("-Ofast")` which is not needed and can be removed.

5. Simplify loop conditions: The program uses a loop condition `for (int i = (a); i < (b); i++)` which can be simplified to `for (int i = a; i < b; i++)` to improve code readability.

6. Simplify if conditions: The program uses complex if conditions such as `if (next[i][1] == -1 || next[i][2] == -1 || next[i][3] == -1)` which can be simplified to `if (next[i][1] == -1 || next[i][2] == -1 || next[i][3] == -1)` to improve code readability.

7. Reduce unnecessary calculations: The program calculates `ans + 1` in the output statement `cout << (ans + 1) << endl;`. We can instead calculate `ans` in the loop and store it in a separate variable to avoid the addition operation in the output statement.

8. Remove unnecessary random number generation: The program includes `srand(chrono::steady_clock::now().time_since_epoch().count());` which generates a random seed. However, there is no use of random numbers in the program, so this line can be removed.

9. Simplify input/output synchronization: The program includes `ios::sync_with_stdio(0)` and `cin.tie(NULL)`. These lines are not necessary as there is no need to synchronize the input/output streams in this program.

Optimized Program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

void solve() {
  string s;
  cin >> s;
  int n = s.size();
  int ans = INF;
  vector<vector<int>> next(n, vector<int>(4, -1));
  next[n - 1][s[n - 1] - '0'] = n - 1;
  for (int i = n - 2; i >= 0; i--) {
    next[i] = next[i + 1];
    next[i][s[i] - '0'] = i;
    if (next[i][1] == -1 || next[i][2] == -1 || next[i][3] == -1) {
      continue;
    }
    int len;
    if (s[i] == '1') {
      len = max(next[i][2], next[i][3]) - i;
    } else if (s[i] == '2') {
      len = max(next[i][1], next[i][3]) - i;
    } else {
      len = max(next[i][1], next[i][2]) - i;
    }
    ans = min(ans, len);
  }
  if (ans == INF) {
    cout << 0 << endl;
  } else {
    cout << ans << endl;
  }
}

int main() {
  int TC;
  cin >> TC;
  while (TC--) {
    solve();
  }
}
```
