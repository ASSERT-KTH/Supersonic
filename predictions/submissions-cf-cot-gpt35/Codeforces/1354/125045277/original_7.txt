The given program seems to be using some optimization techniques already, such as enabling aggressive compiler optimizations and unrolling loops. However, there are still some areas that can be further optimized.

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The program includes several unnecessary header files. We can remove the headers that are not being used in the program, such as <algorithm>, <cmath>, <iostream>, <string>, and <vector>.

2. Remove unnecessary macros: There are several macros defined in the program that are not being used. We can remove macros like EPS, MOD, V, db, ldb, ll, pq, str, uint, ull, umap, uset, ff, ss, pb, pf, dbg, sqr, and all.

3. Avoid using "using namespace std": Using the "using namespace std" directive can lead to naming conflicts and make the code less maintainable. Instead, we can explicitly prefix the standard library types, such as std::string, std::vector, etc.

4. Use 'const' instead of #define: Instead of using #define for constants like INF and endl, we can use const int and const char respectively. This provides type-safety and better code readability.

5. Optimize the loop: The loop in the solve() function can be optimized further. We can avoid unnecessary assignments by initializing the next[i] vector using the next[i+1] vector and then updating only the necessary values. This can reduce the number of assignments and improve performance.

6. Use a more efficient algorithm: The current algorithm checks all possible substrings for each index i, which results in a time complexity of O(n^2). We can optimize this to O(n) by using a sliding window approach. We can keep track of the indices of the last occurrences of 1, 2, and 3. As we iterate through the string, we update these indices and calculate the length of the substring. This approach avoids unnecessary checks and reduces the time complexity.

Here is the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <vector>

const int INF = 1e9;

void solve() {
    std::string s;
    std::cin >> s;
    int n = s.size();
    int ans = INF;
    std::vector<int> last(4, -1);
    for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
        last[s[i] - '0'] = i;
        if (last[1] == -1 || last[2] == -1 || last[3] == -1) {
            continue;
        }
        int len;
        if (s[i] == '1') {
            len = std::max(last[2], last[3]) - i;
        } else if (s[i] == '2') {
            len = std::max(last[1], last[3]) - i;
        } else {
            len = std::max(last[1], last[2]) - i;
        }
        ans = std::min(ans, len);
    }
    if (ans == INF) {
        std::cout << 0 << std::endl;
    } else {
        std::cout << (ans + 1) << std::endl;
    }
}

int main() {
    std::ios::sync_with_stdio(0);
    std::cin.tie(NULL);
    std::cout.tie(NULL);
    int TC;
    std::cin >> TC;
    while (TC--) {
        solve();
    }
    return 0;
}
```

Note: The optimized program has removed the pragma directives for compiler optimizations as they are not necessary for the given code. Feel free to add them back if required.
