The given C/C++ program can be optimized in the following steps:

1. Remove unnecessary include statements: The program includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header file which includes a lot of standard library headers. This can increase compilation time and memory usage. We can remove this line and include only the necessary headers.

2. Remove unnecessary macros: The program defines macros for various operations (`UNIQUE`, `ZIP`, `ADD`, `SUB`, `MUL`, etc.). These macros are not used in the program and can be removed.

3. Replace `scanf` with `cin`: The program uses `scanf` to read input. However, `cin` is a more modern and convenient way to read input in C++. We can replace `scanf` with `cin` to improve readability.

4. Replace `printf` with `cout`: Similar to the previous step, we can replace `printf` with `cout` for output statements.

5. Use references instead of returning values: The `tsort` function in the `t_sort` class returns the topological sorted order as a vector. However, returning a vector by value can be expensive if the vector is large. We can modify the function to take a reference to an empty vector and populate it with the sorted order instead.

6. Remove unnecessary map: The program uses a map `mp` to store whether an edge exists between two vertices. However, this information can be obtained directly from the graph `G` in the `t_sort` class. We can remove the map and retrieve the information from `G`.

7. Optimize loop conditions: The program uses various loop conditions such as `i < n`, `i < n + 1`, etc. These conditions can be simplified to `i < n` as the loops are iterating over elements from 0 to n-1.

Here is the optimized C/C++ program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <deque>
#include <stack>
#include <map>
using namespace std;

class t_sort {
public:
  int n;
  vector<int> ans, deg;
  vector<vector<int>> G;
  void init(int N) {
    n = N;
    deg.resize(n);
    G.resize(n);
  }
  void add_edge(int from, int to) {
    G[from].push_back(to);
    deg[to]++;
  }
  void tsort(vector<int>& sorted) {
    stack<int> st;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      if (deg[i] == 0) st.push(i);
    }
    while (!st.empty()) {
      int v = st.top();
      st.pop();
      sorted.push_back(v);
      for (int i = 0; i < G[v].size(); i++) {
        if (--deg[G[v][i]] == 0) st.push(G[v][i]);
      }
    }
  }
};

int main() {
  int n, m;
  cin >> n >> m;
  t_sort t;
  t.init(n);
  for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
    int x, y;
    cin >> x >> y;
    x--;
    y--;
    t.add_edge(x, y);
  }
  vector<int> ans;
  t.tsort(ans);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cout << ans[i] + 1 << endl;
  }
  int res = 1;
  for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
    if (t.G[ans[i]].end() == find(t.G[ans[i]].begin(), t.G[ans[i]].end(), ans[i + 1])) {
      res = 0;
      break;
    }
  }
  cout << (res == 1 ? 0 : 1) << endl;
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized program removes unnecessary includes, macros, and maps. It also replaces `scanf` and `printf` with `cin` and `cout` respectively for input/output. The `tsort` function now takes a reference to an empty vector to populate the sorted order. Finally, the loop conditions are simplified to improve readability.
