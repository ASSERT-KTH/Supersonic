Step 1: Remove unnecessary includes and using directives
- The program includes the `bits/stdc++.h` header, which includes a lot of unnecessary standard library headers. We can remove this and include only the necessary headers.
- The `using namespace std;` directive is generally considered bad practice because it pollutes the global namespace. We can remove this directive and use the `std::` prefix for standard library types and functions.

Step 2: Remove unnecessary macros
- The program defines several macros that are not used. We can remove these macros to simplify the code.

Step 3: Optimize the topological sort algorithm
- The current implementation of the `tsort` function uses a stack to perform the topological sort. This can be optimized by using a queue instead of a stack. This will allow us to avoid repeatedly pushing and popping elements from the stack.
- We can also eliminate the need for the `ans` vector by directly printing the topological order as we traverse the graph.

Step 4: Optimize the check for missing edges
- The current implementation checks for missing edges by iterating over the `ans` vector and checking each pair of adjacent vertices. This can be optimized by checking the presence of edges during the topological sort itself. We can use a variable `missing` to keep track of whether any missing edges are found.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <deque>
#include <map>
#include <stack>

class t_sort {
public:
  int n;
  std::vector<int> deg;
  std::vector<std::vector<int>> G;
  void init(int N) {
    n = N;
    deg.resize(n);
    G.resize(n);
  }
  void add_edge(int from, int to) {
    G[from].push_back(to);
    deg[to]++;
  }
  void tsort() {
    std::deque<int> q;
    int missing = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      if (deg[i] == 0) {
        q.push_back(i);
      }
    }
    while (!q.empty()) {
      int v = q.front();
      q.pop_front();
      std::cout << v + 1 << std::endl;
      for (int u : G[v]) {
        if (--deg[u] == 0) {
          q.push_back(u);
        }
        else {
          missing = 1;
        }
      }
    }
    std::cout << missing << std::endl;
  }
};

int main() {
  int n, m;
  std::cin >> n >> m;
  t_sort t;
  t.init(n);
  std::map<std::pair<int, int>, int> mp;
  for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
    int x, y;
    std::cin >> x >> y;
    x--;
    y--;
    t.add_edge(x, y);
    mp[std::make_pair(x, y)] = 1;
  }
  t.tsort();
  return 0;
}
```

Explanation of the optimization steps:

- Step 1: Removed unnecessary includes and using directives to simplify the code and reduce the size of the compiled executable.
- Step 2: Removed unnecessary macros to simplify the code and improve readability.
- Step 3: Optimized the topological sort algorithm by using a queue instead of a stack. This eliminates the need for repeatedly pushing and popping elements from the stack, leading to a faster algorithm.
- Step 4: Optimized the check for missing edges by checking the presence of edges during the topological sort itself. This eliminates the need for iterating over the `ans` vector and checking each pair of adjacent vertices, leading to a more efficient algorithm.
