To optimize the given C++ program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The program includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header, which is not part of the standard C++ library. This header includes all other standard headers, which can slow down compilation time. We can remove this include and include only the necessary headers.

2. Remove unused macros: The program defines several macros (`UNIQUE`, `ZIP`, `ADD`, `SUB`, `MUL`, `repi`, `drep`, `rep`, `rrep`, `chmin`, `chmax`, `all`, `rall`, `dmp`, `pb`, `fi`, `se`) that are not used in the code. We can remove these macros to simplify the code.

3. Use `vector` instead of `deque`: The program uses `deque` for the `dq` type, but `vector` can be used instead, which has better performance characteristics for most use cases.

4. Use `emplace_back` instead of `push_back`: The program uses `push_back` to add elements to vectors. We can use `emplace_back` instead, which constructs the element in-place, potentially avoiding unnecessary copy or move operations.

5. Use range-based for loops: The program uses index-based for loops (`rep`, `rrep`) to iterate over elements in a container. We can use range-based for loops instead, which are more concise and can potentially improve performance.

6. Use `const` references where appropriate: The program passes `x` and `y` variables by value to the `add_edge` function, but they are not modified within the function. We can pass them by `const` reference instead to avoid unnecessary copying.

7. Use `unordered_map` instead of `map`: The program uses a `map` to store a mapping between pairs of integers and integers. Since the order of the pairs does not matter, we can use an `unordered_map` instead, which has better average-case performance for lookup and insertion operations.

8. Avoid unnecessary map lookups: The program checks if a value in the `map` is zero inside a loop. We can move this check outside the loop by calculating the value before the loop and using it directly.

9. Use `printf` for output: The program uses `printf` to print integers. We can continue using `printf` for consistency and potentially improve performance.

Here is the optimized C++ program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <stack>
#include <unordered_map>

using namespace std;

class t_sort {
public:
  int n;
  vector<int> ans, deg;
  vector<vector<int>> G;

  void init(int N) {
    n = N;
    deg.resize(n);
    G.resize(n);
  }

  void add_edge(const int& from, const int& to) {
    G[from].emplace_back(to);
    deg[to]++;
  }

  void tsort() {
    stack<int> st;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      if (deg[i] == 0) {
        st.push(i);
      }
    }
    while (!st.empty()) {
      int v = st.top();
      st.pop();
      ans.emplace_back(v);
      for (int i : G[v]) {
        if (--deg[i] == 0) {
          st.push(i);
        }
      }
    }
  }
};

unordered_map<pair<int, int>, int> mp;

int main() {
  int n, m;
  cin >> n >> m;

  t_sort t;
  t.init(n);

  for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
    int x, y;
    cin >> x >> y;
    x--;
    y--;
    t.add_edge(x, y);
    mp[make_pair(x, y)] = 1;
  }

  t.tsort();
  vector<int> ans = t.ans;

  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    printf("%d\n", ans[i] + 1);
  }

  int res = 1;
  for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
    if (mp[make_pair(ans[i], ans[i + 1])] == 0) {
      res = 0;
      break;
    }
  }

  printf("%d\n", res == 1 ? 0 : 1);

  return 0;
}
```

By making these optimizations, we have simplified the code and potentially improved its performance by reducing unnecessary operations and using more efficient data structures.
