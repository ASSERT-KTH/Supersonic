Step 1: Remove unnecessary headers
The program includes `<algorithm>` and `<iostream>` headers, but none of the functions or classes from these headers are used in the program. Therefore, we can remove these headers.

Step 2: Optimize vector initialization
In the original program, the `next` vector is initialized with the indices of all nodes with `cnt` equal to 0. However, instead of iterating over all nodes, we can keep track of the count of nodes with `cnt` equal to 0 and initialize the `next` vector with the exact size needed. This will save memory and improve performance.

Step 3: Optimize vector erase
In the original program, the `next` vector is updated by erasing the last element using `next.erase(next.end() - 1)`. This operation has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the size of the vector. Instead, we can use `next.pop_back()` to remove the last element in O(1) time.

Step 4: Optimize vector push_back
In the original program, the `next` vector is updated by adding elements to the end using `next.push_back()`. However, adding elements to the end of a vector has an amortized time complexity of O(1). Instead, we can use `next.insert(next.begin(), to)` to add elements to the beginning of the vector in O(n) time, where n is the number of elements being inserted.

Step 5: Optimize vector iteration
In the original program, the `edge[tar]` vector is iterated using a range-based for loop. However, using an index-based for loop can be more efficient in terms of both time and memory.

Step 6: Optimize printf and puts
In the original program, the `printf` and `puts` functions are used for output. However, these functions have a higher overhead compared to the `cout` object from the `<iostream>` header. Therefore, we can replace `printf` and `puts` with `cout` for output.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <cstdio>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;
#define FOR(i, a, b) for (int i = (a); i < (b); i++)
#define REP(i, n) FOR(i, 0, n)
typedef pair<int, int> pii;
int n, m;
vector<int> edge[5000];
int cnt[5000];
int main() {
  scanf("%d %d", &n, &m);
  REP(i, m) {
    int a, b;
    scanf("%d %d", &a, &b);
    a--;
    b--;
    edge[a].push_back(b);
    cnt[b]++;
  }
  vector<int> ans;
  bool flag = false;
  vector<int> next(cnt, 0);
  REP(i, n) if (cnt[i] == 0) next.push_back(i);
  REP(i, n) {
    int tar = next[next.size() - 1];
    ans.push_back(tar + 1);
    next.pop_back();
    if (next.size() > 0)
      flag = true;
    REP(j, edge[tar].size()) {
      int to = edge[tar][j];
      if (--cnt[to] == 0)
        next.insert(next.begin(), to);
    }
  }
  REP(i, ans.size()) printf("%d\n", ans[i]);
  if (flag)
    puts("1");
  else
    puts("0");
  return 0;
}
```
