Step 1: Simplify the condition for breaking out of the loop

Currently, the program checks if both H and W are equal to 0 to break out of the loop. We can simplify this condition by checking if either H or W is equal to 0. If one of them is 0, there is no need to continue the loop.

Step 2: Remove unnecessary namespace usage

The program is currently using the entire std namespace. We can remove this and specify the namespace for specific functions that we use.

Step 3: Optimize the output

The current program outputs one character at a time, which can be slow. We can optimize this by using a string to store all the characters for each row and then outputting the string at once.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using std::cin;
using std::cout;
using std::endl;

int main() {
  int H, W;
  while (true) {
    cin >> H >> W;
    if (H == 0 || W == 0)
      break;
    string row;
    for (int i = 1; i <= H; i++) {
      row.clear();
      for (int j = 1; j <= W; j++) {
        if (i == 1 || i == H || j == 1 || j == W) {
          row += "#";
        } else {
          row += ".";
        }
      }
      cout << row << endl;
    }
    cout << endl;
  }
}
```
