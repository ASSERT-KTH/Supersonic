Step 1: Reduce the number of unnecessary operations inside the nested loops.
- The program currently checks the conditions `i == 1` and `i == H` for each iteration of the inner loop. Since these conditions do not change within the inner loop, we can move them outside the inner loop to reduce unnecessary operations.

Step 2: Optimize the output buffering.
- The program currently uses `cout` to output characters individually. This can be slow as `cout` is line-buffered by default. We can improve the output speed by buffering the output and printing it in chunks.

Step 3: Remove the unnecessary `endl` statement.
- The program currently uses `endl` after each line of output. This forces a flush of the output buffer and can slow down the program. We can replace `endl` with `"\n"` to improve performance.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int H, W;
  string row;

  while (cin >> H >> W && (H != 0 || W != 0)) {
    row.assign(W, '#');

    for (int i = 1; i <= H; i++) {
      if (i == 1 || i == H) {
        cout << row << "\n";
      } else {
        cout << "#" << string(W - 2, '.') << "#\n";
      }
    }

    cout << "\n";
  }

  return 0;
}
```

Explanation:
- We create a string `row` with the width `W` filled with `#`. This represents the first and last row of the output.
- We use `cin >> H >> W && (H != 0 || W != 0)` as the condition for the while loop. This allows us to read `H` and `W` together and exit the loop if both values are 0.
- Inside the nested loops, we use `cout << row << "\n"` to output the first and last row. This reduces unnecessary checks and operations.
- For the other rows, we use `cout << "#" << string(W - 2, '.') << "#\n"` to output the left and right borders with dots in between.
- We use `"\n"` instead of `endl` to improve performance by avoiding unnecessary flushing of the output buffer.
