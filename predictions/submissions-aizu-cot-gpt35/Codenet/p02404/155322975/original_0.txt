The given program prints a grid of characters based on the input values of H and W. The grid has a border of "#" characters and the inner cells have "." characters.

To optimize the program, we can eliminate unnecessary iterations and redundant checks.

1. Instead of using a `while(1)` loop, we can use a `do-while` loop. This way, we can eliminate the initial `cin` statement before the loop.

2. We can remove the check for `H == 0 && W == 0` inside the loop. Instead, we can move the check to the end of the loop and break if the condition is met. This will avoid one unnecessary iteration.

3. The inner `if-else` statement can be simplified. Since the border cells have "#" characters and the inner cells have ".", we don't need to check for `i == 1 || i == H` and `j == 1 || j == W` conditions separately. We can use a single `if` statement to check if `i == 1 || i == H || j == 1 || j == W` and output the respective character.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int H, W;
  
  do {
    cin >> H >> W;
    
    for (int i = 1; i <= H; i++) {
      for (int j = 1; j <= W; j++) {
        if (i == 1 || i == H || j == 1 || j == W) {
          cout << "#";
        } else {
          cout << ".";
        }
      }
      cout << endl;
    }
    cout << endl;
  } while (H != 0 && W != 0);
}
```
