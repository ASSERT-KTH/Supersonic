The given program generates a grid of characters based on the input values of H (height) and W (width). The grid consists of '#' characters on the borders and '.' characters on the inside.

To optimize this program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove the unnecessary "using namespace std;" line. It's considered a good practice to avoid using the entire namespace in global scope.

2. Change the loop conditions to iterate up to H-2 and W-2 instead of H and W. This is because the first and last rows as well as the first and last columns are already handled separately in the if conditions.

3. Use the newline character '\n' instead of endl to improve the performance. The endl inserts a newline and flushes the output buffer, which can be costly.

4. Remove the extra cout << endl; statement at the end of the outer loop. It's not necessary to print an additional newline after each grid.

Here is the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  int H, W;
  while (true) {
    std::cin >> H >> W;
    if (H == 0 && W == 0)
      break;
    for (int i = 1; i <= H - 2; i++) {
      for (int j = 1; j <= W - 2; j++) {
        if (i == 1 || i == H - 2 || j == 1 || j == W - 2) {
          std::cout << "#";
        } else {
          std::cout << ".";
        }
      }
      std::cout << '\n';
    }
    std::cout << '\n';
  }
}
```

These optimizations should improve the running time and memory usage of the program.
