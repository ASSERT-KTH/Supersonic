The given program calculates the maximum difference between any two elements in the array `R`. The program iterates over the array `R` twice, once to calculate the maximum difference and once to calculate the minimum value.

The program can be optimized by combining the two loops into a single loop. Instead of calculating the maximum difference and the minimum value separately, we can calculate them simultaneously in a single iteration.

To do this, we can initialize the `maxv` variable to `R[1] - R[0]` and the `minv` variable to `R[0]`. Then, we iterate over the array starting from the second element (i.e., `i = 1`) and update the `maxv` and `minv` variables as follows:

1. Calculate the difference between the current element `R[i]` and the minimum value `minv`. If this difference is greater than the current `maxv`, update `maxv` with this difference.
2. Update `minv` with the minimum value between the current element `R[i]` and the current `minv`.

By combining these two steps in a single loop, we can optimize the program to reduce the number of iterations and improve its running time.

Here's the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
static const int MAX = 200000;
int main() {
  int R[MAX], n;
  cin >> n;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    cin >> R[i];
  int maxv = R[1] - R[0];
  int minv = R[0];
  for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
    int diff = R[i] - minv;
    maxv = max(maxv, diff);
    minv = min(minv, R[i]);
  }
  cout << maxv << endl;
  return 0;
}
```

In this optimized program, we calculate the difference between the current element and the minimum value only once in each iteration. This eliminates the need to calculate the difference twice in the original program and reduces the number of operations, resulting in improved performance.
