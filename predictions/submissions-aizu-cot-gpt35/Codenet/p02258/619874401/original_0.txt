The given program calculates the maximum difference between any two elements in an array `R` of size `n`. The current implementation uses a linear approach to find the maximum difference.

To optimize the program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove the unnecessary inclusion of the `<algorithm>` header file as it is not being used in the current implementation.

2. Remove the `using namespace std;` statement and explicitly qualify the standard library functions and types to avoid any potential naming conflicts.

3. Instead of initializing `maxv` with `R[1] - R[0]`, we can initialize it with a minimum possible value. This will handle the case when there is no difference between any two elements in the array.

4. Instead of initializing `minv` with `R[0]`, we can initialize it with the maximum possible value. This will ensure that any element in the array will be smaller than the initial value of `minv`.

5. We can combine the two loops into a single loop. Instead of iterating from `i = 1` to `n-1` and separately updating `maxv` and `minv`, we can iterate from `i = 0` to `n-1` and update `maxv` and `minv` in the same loop.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
static const int MAX = 200000;
int main() {
  int R[MAX], n;
  std::cin >> n;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    std::cin >> R[i];
  int maxv = INT_MIN;
  int minv = INT_MAX;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    maxv = std::max(maxv, R[i] - minv);
    minv = std::min(minv, R[i]);
  }
  std::cout << maxv << std::endl;
  return 0;
}
```
