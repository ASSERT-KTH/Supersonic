Step 1: Remove unnecessary includes
The program includes the `<algorithm>` library, but it does not use any functions from it. We can remove this include statement to reduce unnecessary overhead.

Step 2: Remove unused variable
The variable `R` is declared as an array of size `MAX`, but it is not used in the program. We can remove this variable declaration to reduce memory usage.

Step 3: Optimize the loop
Currently, the program loops through the array `R` twice. We can optimize this by combining the two loops into one. Additionally, we can start the loop from index 1 instead of 0 since `maxv` and `minv` are initialized with the values at index 0.

Step 4: Improve variable naming
The variable names `maxv` and `minv` are not very descriptive. We can improve the readability of the program by renaming them to `maxDifference` and `currentMin`.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  int maxDifference = 0;
  int currentMin;
  cin >> currentMin;
  for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
    int currentNumber;
    cin >> currentNumber;
    maxDifference = max(maxDifference, currentNumber - currentMin);
    currentMin = min(currentMin, currentNumber);
  }
  cout << maxDifference << endl;
  return 0;
}
```
