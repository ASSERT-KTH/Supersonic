The given program finds the maximum profit that can be obtained by subtracting the minimum value from each element in a given vector. The program uses two iterators to iterate through the vector twice, which can be optimized to a single iteration.

To optimize the program, we can combine the two loops into a single loop by calculating the maximum profit and minimum value simultaneously. This way, we only need to iterate through the vector once, reducing the number of iterations.

Here is the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int n;
  int maxProfit = 1 - 1000000000;
  int Ri = 2000000000;
  cin >> n;
  vector<int> R(n);

  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> R[i];
    if (maxProfit < R[i] - Ri) {
      maxProfit = R[i] - Ri;
    }
    if (R[i] < Ri) {
      Ri = R[i];
    }
  }

  cout << maxProfit << endl;
  return 0;
}
```

In the optimized version, we use a for loop to iterate through the vector. Inside the loop, we calculate the maximum profit and update the minimum value simultaneously. This eliminates the need for a second iteration and reduces the overall running time of the program.
