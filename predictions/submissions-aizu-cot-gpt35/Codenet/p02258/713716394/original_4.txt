The given program calculates the maximum profit by subtracting each element of the vector `R` from the variable `Ri`. It also keeps track of the maximum profit in the variable `maxProfit`.

To optimize this program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary headers: The program includes the `<iostream>` header, but it is not used. We can remove it.

2. Remove unnecessary variable initialization: The variable `maxProfit` is initially set to `1 - 1000000000`. Since we are finding the maximum profit, it is safe to assume that any profit will be greater than this value. Therefore, we can remove the initialization of `maxProfit` and set it to the first element of the vector `R` during the loop.

3. Remove unnecessary `using` statement: The program uses the `std` namespace, but it is only used for the `vector` class. We can remove the `using` statement and qualify the `vector` class with the `std` namespace.

4. Use range-based `for` loop: Instead of using iterators to loop through the vector `R`, we can use a range-based `for` loop to simplify the code.

5. Simplify the logic for calculating `maxProfit` and `Ri`: Instead of checking and updating `maxProfit` and `Ri` separately, we can combine them into a single loop. We can calculate the current profit by subtracting the current element from `Ri`, and update `maxProfit` and `Ri` accordingly.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

int main() {
    int n;
    int maxProfit;
    int Ri;
    std::cin >> n;
    std::vector<int> R(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        std::cin >> R[i];
        if (i == 0) {
            maxProfit = R[i];
            Ri = R[i];
        } else {
            int profit = R[i] - Ri;
            maxProfit = std::max(maxProfit, profit);
            Ri = std::min(Ri, R[i]);
        }
    }
    std::cout << maxProfit << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```
