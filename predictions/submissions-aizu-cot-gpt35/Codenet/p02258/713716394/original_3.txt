Step 1: Remove unnecessary header files
The code includes the `<iostream>` header file, which is not necessary for the given code. We can remove it to improve compile time.

Step 2: Remove unnecessary using namespace std
The code uses the `using namespace std` statement, which imports the entire `std` namespace. This can lead to naming conflicts and is generally considered bad practice. We can remove it and use the `std::` prefix where necessary.

Step 3: Optimize variable initialization
The variable `maxProfit` is initialized with a value of `1 - 1000000000`, which is an unnecessary calculation. We can initialize it with a more reasonable value, such as `INT_MIN`.

Step 4: Optimize vector iteration
The vector `R` is iterated twice using separate iterators. We can combine both iterations into a single loop to improve performance.

Step 5: Optimize variable comparison
The variable `maxProfit` is compared with `*itr - Ri` in each iteration. We can optimize this by calculating `*itr - Ri` once and storing it in a separate variable.

Step 6: Optimize variable assignment
The variable `Ri` is updated with each iteration, but it is only used for comparison. We can optimize this by assigning `*itr` to `Ri` only when necessary, i.e., when `*itr < Ri`.

Optimized code:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

int main() {
  int n;
  int maxProfit = INT_MIN;
  int Ri = 2000000000;
  
  std::cin >> n;
  std::vector<int> R(n);
  
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    std::cin >> R[i];
    int profit = R[i] - Ri;
    if (maxProfit < profit) {
      maxProfit = profit;
    }
    if (R[i] < Ri) {
      Ri = R[i];
    }
  }
  
  std::cout << maxProfit << std::endl;
  return 0;
}
```
