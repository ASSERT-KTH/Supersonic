Step 1: Remove unnecessary includes
Since we are not using any features from the `<iostream>` and `<vector>` libraries, we can remove the include statements for these libraries.

Step 2: Optimize variable initialization
The initial value for `maxProfit` and `Ri` can be optimized to avoid unnecessary calculations. We can set `maxProfit` to the smallest possible value (INT_MIN) and `Ri` to the largest possible value (INT_MAX) to ensure that any subsequent value will be greater than these initial values.

Step 3: Optimize vector iteration
Instead of using `vector<int>::iterator`, we can use range-based for loop to simplify the code and improve readability.

Step 4: Optimize maxProfit calculation
Instead of checking if `maxProfit` is less than the difference between the current element and `Ri`, we can directly subtract `Ri` from the current element and update `maxProfit` if the result is greater than the current `maxProfit`.

Step 5: Optimize Ri calculation
Instead of checking if the current element is less than `Ri` and updating `Ri`, we can directly assign the current element to `Ri` if it is less than the current `Ri`.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int n;
  int maxProfit = INT_MIN;
  int Ri = INT_MAX;
  
  cin >> n;
  
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    int R;
    cin >> R;
    
    maxProfit = max(maxProfit, R - Ri);
    Ri = min(Ri, R);
  }
  
  cout << maxProfit << endl;
  
  return 0;
}
```
