Optimization Step by Step:

1. Remove unnecessary headers: The `<algorithm>` header is not used in the program, so it can be removed.
2. Use more efficient data types: The program uses an array `prime` and `dp` of size 1000001 to store boolean values. Since the values are either true or false, we can optimize memory usage by using a `bitset` instead of an array. A `bitset` uses only a single bit to represent each boolean value, resulting in significant memory savings.
3. Use a more efficient prime sieve algorithm: The current prime sieve algorithm iterates from 3 to 1000000 and marks multiples of each prime as non-prime. This can be optimized by only considering odd numbers in the sieve loop and skipping even multiples of each prime. Additionally, we can reduce the loop range from 1000000 to the square root of 1000000, as any non-prime number greater than the square root will already have been marked as non-prime by the smaller primes.
4. Optimize the inner loop in the main algorithm: The inner loop checks if a subset of the array `a` can sum up to a given value `i`. However, it can be optimized to skip unnecessary iterations by breaking out of the loop once a valid subset is found. This can be done by introducing a flag variable to track whether a subset has been found.
5. Remove redundant check in the final loop: The final loop checks if a prime number exists in the `dp` array. However, since we know that `dp[0]` is always true, we can skip the check for `dp[i]` being true when `i` is 0. This can simplify the loop condition.
6. Add comments to improve code readability: Adding comments to explain the purpose and functionality of each section of code can help improve code readability and maintainability.

Optimized Program:

```cpp
#include <bitset>
#include <stdio.h>
using namespace std;

const int MAX_N = 30;
const int MAX_X = 1000001;

int n, x, a[MAX_N];
bitset<MAX_X> dp, prime;

int main() {
  prime.set(0);
  prime.set(2);
  for (int i = 3; i * i < MAX_X; i += 2) {
    if (prime[i]) {
      for (int j = i * i; j < MAX_X; j += 2 * i)
        prime.reset(j);
    }
  }

  while (scanf("%d%d", &n, &x), n) {
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
      scanf("%d", &a[i]);

    sort(a, a + n);

    dp.reset();
    dp.set(0);

    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      for (int j = x; j >= a[i]; j--) {
        if (dp[j - a[i]]) {
          dp.set(j);
          break;
        }
      }
    }

    for (int i = x; i >= 0; i--) {
      if (i == 0 || (dp[i] && prime[i])) {
        printf(i ? "%d\n" : "NA\n", i);
        break;
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Explanation of Optimization Steps:

1. Removed unnecessary header `<algorithm>`.
2. Replaced the arrays `dp` and `prime` with `bitset` data types, reducing memory usage.
3. Optimized prime sieve algorithm by only considering odd numbers and reducing the loop range to the square root of `MAX_X`.
4. Optimized the inner loop by breaking out of it once a valid subset is found.
5. Simplified the final loop condition by skipping the check for `dp[i]` being true when `i` is 0.
