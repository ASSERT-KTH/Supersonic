Step 1: Remove unnecessary headers
- The program includes the `<algorithm>` header, which is not used in the program. We can remove this header.

Step 2: Optimize the prime number generation
- The program uses the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to generate prime numbers up to 1,000,000. However, it can be optimized to only generate prime numbers up to the square root of 1,000,000.
- We can modify the second loop to iterate up to the square root of 1,000,000 instead of 1,000.
- We also need to update the condition for the inner loop to `i * j <= 1,000,000`.

Step 3: Optimize the dynamic programming loop
- The program uses a dynamic programming approach to solve a subset sum problem.
- However, it initializes `dp` array with `x + 1` elements and sets all elements to `false`. This is unnecessary since the loop only iterates up to `x`.
- We can initialize `dp` array with `x` elements and set all elements to `false`.

Step 4: Optimize the output loop
- The program uses a loop to find the largest prime number that can be formed as a sum of the given numbers.
- However, it starts the loop from `x` and iterates down to `0`. This can be optimized to start the loop from `x - 1` and iterate down to `1`, since `dp[0]` will always be `false`.

Here is the optimized C++ program:

```cpp
#include <stdio.h>
using namespace std;

const int MAX_N = 30;
const int MAX_X = 1000000;

int n, x, a[MAX_N];
bool dp[MAX_X], prime[MAX_X];

int main() {
  prime[0] = true, prime[2] = true;
  for (int i = 3; i * i <= MAX_X; i += 2)
    prime[i] = true;

  for (int i = 3; i * i <= MAX_X; i++) {
    if (!prime[i])
      continue;
    for (int j = i; i * j <= MAX_X; j += 2)
      prime[i * j] = false;
  }

  while (scanf("%d%d", &n, &x), n) {
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
      scanf("%d", &a[i]);

    sort(a, a + n);

    for (int i = 0; i < x; i++)
      dp[i] = false;

    dp[0] = true;

    for (int i = 1; i < x; i++) {
      for (int j = 0; j < n && i >= a[j]; j++) {
        if (dp[i - a[j]]) {
          dp[i] = true;
          break;
        }
      }
    }

    for (int i = x - 1; i >= 1; i--) {
      if (dp[i] && prime[i]) {
        printf(i ? "%d\n" : "NA\n", i);
        break;
      }
    }
  }
}
```
