Step 1: Optimizing the Sieve of Eratosthenes

The first optimization we can make is in the sieve of Eratosthenes implementation. In the original program, we store prime numbers up to 1000000 in an array of size 1000001. This is not necessary as we only need to store the odd numbers from 3 to 1000000. By doing this, we can reduce the memory usage by half.

Step 2: Optimizing the prime number check

In the inner loop of the main algorithm, we check if each number is prime by accessing the `prime` array. However, this can be optimized further. Instead of accessing the `prime` array, we can directly check if a number is prime by using the sieve of Eratosthenes logic. We can do this by checking if a number is divisible by any prime number up to its square root. This way, we can avoid accessing the `prime` array altogether.

Step 3: Optimizing the main algorithm

In the main algorithm, we are using a nested loop to check all possible sums of the given numbers. However, we can optimize this by using dynamic programming. Instead of checking all possible sums, we can keep track of the sums that can be achieved by using a subset of the given numbers. We can use a boolean array `dp` to store this information. The index `i` in the `dp` array represents the sum `i`, and if `dp[i]` is true, it means that the sum `i` can be achieved by using a subset of the given numbers.

To implement this, we initialize the `dp` array with `dp[0] = true` and `dp[i] = false` for all other indices. Then, for each number `a[j]` in the given numbers, we iterate through the `dp` array starting from index `a[j]` and update `dp[i] = true` for all indices `i` greater than or equal to `a[j]` if `dp[i - a[j]]` is true. This way, we can build up the `dp` array to represent all possible sums that can be achieved.

Finally, we iterate through the `dp` array in reverse order starting from index `x` and find the largest prime number that can be achieved. We can do this by checking if `dp[i]` is true and if `i` is prime. If we find such a number, we print it and break out of the loop.
