The given program reads a number `n` and then reads `2*n` lines, each line consisting of a character (`Mark`) and an integer (`Num`). It stores the information in a 2D array `Cards` and then prints the missing cards for each suit.

To optimize this program, we can make the following changes:
1. Remove the unused variable `i`.
2. Remove the unused variable `n`.
3. Remove the unused variable `Num`.
4. Change the data type of `Mark` from `char` to `int`.
5. Instead of using `scanf` twice for `Mark` and `Num`, we can use a single `scanf` statement to read the entire line.
6. Instead of using separate `printf` statements for each suit, we can combine them into a single loop.

Here is the optimized program:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
  int Cards[4][14] = {{}};
  int j, Mark;
  
  scanf("%d", &Mark);
  while (Mark--) {
    int Num;
    char suit;
    scanf(" %c %d", &suit, &Num);
    
    if (suit == 'S') {
      Cards[0][Num - 1] = 1;
    } else if (suit == 'H') {
      Cards[1][Num - 1] = 1;
    } else if (suit == 'C') {
      Cards[2][Num - 1] = 1;
    } else if (suit == 'D') {
      Cards[3][Num - 1] = 1;
    }
  }
  
  for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
    for (j = 0; j < 13; j++) {
      if (Cards[i][j] != 1) {
        char suit;
        if (i == 0) {
          suit = 'S';
        } else if (i == 1) {
          suit = 'H';
        } else if (i == 2) {
          suit = 'C';
        } else if (i == 3) {
          suit = 'D';
        }
        printf("%c %d\n", suit, j + 1);
      }
    }
  }
  
  return 0;
}
```

Explanation of the optimization steps:
1. The variable `i` is not used anywhere in the program, so it can be safely removed.
2. The variable `n` is not used after reading it from `scanf`, so it can be removed.
3. The variable `Num` is only used inside the loop, so it can be moved to the loop scope.
4. The data type of `Mark` can be changed to `int` to match the format specifier in `scanf`.
5. By using a single `scanf` statement with a modified format string, we can read the entire line in one go.
6. Instead of using separate `printf` statements for each suit, we can combine them into a single loop by using a nested loop to iterate over both suits and numbers. We can also use a separate variable `suit` to store the corresponding suit character.
