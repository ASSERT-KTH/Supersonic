Step 1: Reduce the number of iterations in the loops

Currently, the loops iterate from 1 to 13 (14 iterations) for each suit. However, the Cards array has 14 elements for each suit. To optimize this, we can change the loop iteration to iterate from 0 to 13 (13 iterations) for each suit.

Step 2: Use an integer array for the Marks

Currently, the Mark is read as a character and then compared to different characters using if-else statements. We can simplify this by using an integer array to map the characters 'S', 'H', 'C', 'D' to their respective indices. This will allow us to directly access the Cards array using the Mark as an index.

Step 3: Remove unnecessary variable initialization

The Cards array is already initialized with all elements set to 0. Therefore, we can remove the empty initialization ({{}}) in the array declaration.

Step 4: Combine the loops for printing the result

Currently, there are four separate loops for printing the result for each suit. We can combine these loops into a single loop by using a separate array to store the suit labels ('S', 'H', 'C', 'D').

Here is the optimized program:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
  int Cards[4][14] = {0};
  int i, j, n, Num;
  int Marks[256] = {0};
  char Mark;

  Marks['S'] = 0;
  Marks['H'] = 1;
  Marks['C'] = 2;
  Marks['D'] = 3;

  scanf("%d", &n);
  for (i = 0; i < 2 * n; i++) {
    scanf(" %c%d", &Mark, &Num);
    Cards[Marks[Mark]][Num - 1] = 1;
  }

  char SuitLabels[] = {'S', 'H', 'C', 'D'};
  for (int suit = 0; suit < 4; suit++) {
    for (j = 0; j < 13; j++) {
      if (Cards[suit][j] != 1) {
        printf("%c %d\n", SuitLabels[suit], j + 1);
      }
    }
  }

  return 0;
}
```

Explanation:

- Step 1: The loops for printing the result now iterate from 0 to 12 (13 iterations) for each suit.
- Step 2: The Marks array is used to map the characters 'S', 'H', 'C', 'D' to their respective indices.
- Step 3: The empty initialization ({{}}) in the Cards array declaration is removed.
- Step 4: The loops for printing the result are combined into a single loop using the SuitLabels array to store the suit labels.
