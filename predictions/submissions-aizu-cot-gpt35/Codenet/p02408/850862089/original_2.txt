The program reads an integer `n` and `2n` lines of input. Each line consists of a character `Mark` and an integer `Num`. The program then stores the presence of each card in a 2D array `Cards` and prints the missing cards for each suit.

To optimize the program, we can make the following modifications:
1. Remove the unused variable `i` from the main loop.
2. Change the 2D array `Cards` to a 1D array of size 52. This eliminates the need for multiple array accesses and reduces memory usage.
3. Instead of using nested if-else statements to update the `Cards` array, calculate the index directly using the formula `index = (Mark - 'S') * 13 + (Num - 1)`.
4. Combine the four loops that print the missing cards into a single loop.

Here is the optimized program:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
  int Cards[52] = {0};
  int n, Num, index;
  char Mark;

  scanf("%d", &n);
  for (int i = 0; i < 2 * n; i++) {
    scanf(" %c %d", &Mark, &Num);
    index = (Mark - 'S') * 13 + (Num - 1);
    Cards[index] = 1;
  }

  for (int j = 0; j < 52; j++) {
    if (Cards[j] != 1) {
      Mark = (j / 13) + 'S';
      Num = (j % 13) + 1;
      printf("%c %d\n", Mark, Num);
    }
  }

  return 0;
}
```

Explanation of optimizations:
1. Removing unused variable `i` has no impact on performance, but it improves code readability.
2. Changing the 2D array `Cards` to a 1D array reduces memory usage and improves cache locality, which can lead to better performance.
3. By calculating the index directly, we eliminate the need for multiple if-else statements, reducing branching and improving performance.
4. Combining the four loops into a single loop reduces the overhead of loop iterations and improves performance.
