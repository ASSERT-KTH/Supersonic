The given program reads a number `n` and `2n` pairs of characters and integers from the input. It then populates a 2D array `Cards` based on the input, where each row represents a suit (S, H, C, D) and each column represents a card number (1-13). Finally, it prints the missing cards for each suit.

To optimize this program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove the `scanf("%c ", &Mark);` statement from the loop. This statement reads the newline character after the integer, but we don't need it. We can simply use `scanf(" %c", &Mark);` to skip any leading whitespace characters and read the character directly.

2. Change the size of the `Cards` array from `4x14` to `4x13`. Since the card numbers are 1-13, we don't need the extra column.

3. Combine the four loops that print the missing cards into a single loop. This way, we can iterate over the `Cards` array only once instead of four times.

Here's the optimized program:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
  int Cards[4][13] = {{}};
  int i, j, n, Num;
  char Mark;

  scanf("%d", &n);

  for (i = 0; i < 2 * n; i++) {
    scanf(" %c%d", &Mark, &Num);
    if (Mark == 'S') {
      Cards[0][Num - 1] = 1;
    } else if (Mark == 'H') {
      Cards[1][Num - 1] = 1;
    } else if (Mark == 'C') {
      Cards[2][Num - 1] = 1;
    } else if (Mark == 'D') {
      Cards[3][Num - 1] = 1;
    }
  }

  for (i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
    for (j = 0; j < 13; j++) {
      if (Cards[i][j] != 1) {
        switch (i) {
          case 0:
            printf("S %d\n", j + 1);
            break;
          case 1:
            printf("H %d\n", j + 1);
            break;
          case 2:
            printf("C %d\n", j + 1);
            break;
          case 3:
            printf("D %d\n", j + 1);
            break;
        }
      }
    }
  }

  return 0;
}
```
