Step 1: Remove unnecessary includes and typedefs.

In the given code, the `bits/stdc++.h` header file is included, which is not a standard C++ header file. It includes a huge number of standard headers and may slow down the compilation process. We can remove this include statement and include the required standard headers individually.

The `typedef` statements for `ll` and `pii` are not used in the code. We can remove them as well.

Step 2: Remove unnecessary debug macros.

The code includes some debug macros that are not used in the final program. We can remove the `debug` and `show` macros along with the `#ifdef DEBUG` block.

Step 3: Optimize the recursive functions.

The `is_indent_n`, `yaml`, `mapping`, `mapping_item`, `indent`, `key`, and `string_` functions are all implemented recursively. Recursive functions can consume a lot of memory and may cause stack overflow for large inputs. We can optimize these functions to use iterative approaches instead.

Step 4: Optimize the `solve` function.

The `solve` function reads the input line by line using `getline`. Instead of storing the input in a string, we can process each line immediately to save memory. We can also remove the unnecessary `cin.ignore()` statement.

Now, let's generate the optimized code:
