The given program is a YAML parser that takes a YAML string as input and a query string, and returns the value corresponding to the query in the YAML object.

To optimize the program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary include statements: The `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` statement includes a large number of standard library headers, which can increase compile time and memory usage. Since the program does not use all the standard library headers, we can remove this statement and include only the necessary headers.

2. Remove unused typedefs and aliases: The program defines `typedef` and `using` statements for types like `ll`, `pii`, and `vec`. However, these types are not used anywhere in the program. We can remove these statements to reduce unnecessary code.

3. Avoid unnecessary copying of strings: The `key()` and `string_()` functions copy characters from the input string to a new string. This can be avoided by passing a reference to the output string and appending characters directly to it, instead of creating a new string.

4. Avoid unnecessary recursion: The `mapping()` function is implemented using recursion, which can lead to excessive stack usage for large YAML strings. We can avoid recursion by using a loop instead. This will reduce memory usage and improve performance.

5. Use a more efficient data structure for storing pointers: The `item` struct contains a vector of pointers to other `item` objects. Storing pointers in a vector can lead to inefficient memory usage and cache misses. Instead, we can use a linked list or a tree structure to store the pointers.

6. Use a more efficient data structure for searching: The program uses a linear search to find the matching property in the YAML object. This can be slow for large YAML objects. We can use a more efficient data structure, such as a hash table or a binary search tree, to store and search for properties.
