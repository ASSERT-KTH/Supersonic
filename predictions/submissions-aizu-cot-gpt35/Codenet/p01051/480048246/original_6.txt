The given program is an implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path in a grid-based game. To optimize the program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The program includes unnecessary header files such as `<algorithm>`, `<cstdio>`, `<functional>`, `<queue>`, and `<utility>`. Since these headers are not used in the program, we can remove them to improve compile time and reduce memory usage.

2. Remove unnecessary typedefs: The program defines unnecessary typedefs for `Edge` and `P`. We can remove these typedefs and directly use the `struct` and `std::pair<int, int>` types.

3. Use constant expressions instead of variables: The program defines several constants using variables, such as `kCostFriendlyInk`, `kCostShot`, `kCostBlank`, `kShotRange`, `kWall`, `kFriend`, `kEnemy`, `kStart`, and `kGoal`. We can replace these variables with constant expressions to avoid unnecessary memory usage and improve runtime performance.

4. Avoid unnecessary variables: The program defines variables `R` and `C` to store the number of rows and columns of the grid. Instead of storing these values, we can directly use the `xy2pos()` function to calculate the position of each cell.

5. Replace nested loops with a single loop: The program uses nested loops to iterate over the grid and calculate the costs of moving to adjacent cells. We can optimize this by using a single loop and iterating over all the cells in the grid. This reduces the number of iterations and improves runtime performance.

6. Use a fixed-size array instead of a vector: The program uses a vector `cost` to store the costs of moving between cells. Since the maximum size of the grid is fixed, we can use a fixed-size array instead of a vector to improve memory usage and runtime performance.

7. Use a priority queue with a custom comparator: The program uses `std::priority_queue` with `std::greater<P>` as the comparator to implement Dijkstra's algorithm. However, we can optimize this by using a custom comparator that compares the distances directly, instead of using `std::greater<P>`. This eliminates the need to create pairs and improves runtime performance.

8. Use `scanf` and `printf` instead of `std::cin` and `std::cout`: The program uses `std::cin` and `std::cout` for input and output operations, which can be slower compared to the `scanf` and `printf` functions. We can replace these functions with `scanf` and `printf` to improve runtime performance.

Here's the optimized program with the above modifications:

```cpp
#define _CRT_SECURE_NO_WARNINGS
#include <cstdio>
#include <vector>

struct Edge {
  int to, cost;
};

const int kMaxSize = 32;
const int kMaxField = kMaxSize * kMaxSize;
const int kCostFriendlyInk = 1;
const int kCostShot = 2;
const int kCostBlank = 2;
const int kShotRange = 3;
const char kWall = '#';
const char kFriend = 'o';
const char kEnemy = 'x';
const char kStart = 'S';
const char kGoal = 'G';
const char kBlank = '.';

char field[kMaxField];
int way[4] = {-1, 1, -kMaxSize, kMaxSize};
const int kInf = 1 << 16;
int d[kMaxField];
Edge cost[kMaxField];

inline int xy2pos(const int x, const int y) {
  return x + y * kMaxSize;
}

void initCost() {
  for (int pos = 0; pos < kMaxField; pos++) {
    if (field[pos] == kWall)
      continue;

    for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
      for (int j = 1; j <= kShotRange; j++) {
        int newpos = pos + j * way[i];
        if (field[newpos] == kWall)
          break;

        int newcost;
        if (j == 1) {
          if (field[newpos] == kFriend)
            newcost = kCostFriendlyInk;
          else if (field[newpos] == kEnemy)
            newcost = kCostShot + kCostFriendlyInk;
          else
            newcost = kCostBlank;
        } else {
          if (field[newpos] == kFriend)
            newcost = std::min(kCostShot + kCostFriendlyInk * j, cost[pos].cost + kCostFriendlyInk);
          else if (field[newpos] == kEnemy)
            newcost = kCostShot + kCostFriendlyInk * j;
          else
            newcost = std::min(kCostShot + kCostFriendlyInk * j, cost[pos].cost + kCostBlank);
        }

        cost[pos].push_back({newpos, newcost});
      }
    }
  }
}

void dijkstra(int spos) {
  std::priority_queue<int, std::vector<int>, std::greater<int>> q;
  std::fill(d, d + kMaxField, kInf);
  d[spos] = 0;
  q.push(spos);

  while (!q.empty()) {
    int p = q.top();
    q.pop();

    if (d[p] == kInf)
      break;

    for (const Edge& e : cost[p]) {
      if (d[e.to] > d[p] + e.cost) {
        d[e.to] = d[p] + e.cost;
        q.push(e.to);
      }
    }
  }
}

int main() {
  int start, goal;
  std::fill(field, field + kMaxField, '#');
  std::scanf("%d %d", &R, &C);

  for (int y = 1; y <= R; y++) {
    for (int x = 1; x <= C; x++) {
      int pos = xy2pos(x, y);
      std::scanf(" %c", &field[pos]);

      if (field[pos] == kStart)
        start = pos;
      else if (field[pos] == kGoal)
        goal = pos;
    }
  }

  initCost();
  dijkstra(start);
  std::printf("%d\n", d[goal]);

  return 0;
}
```

Note: Since the original program contains some undefined behavior due to accessing out-of-bounds memory, the optimized program also retains these issues. It is assumed that the input grid is correctly formatted and does not contain any out-of-bounds accesses.
