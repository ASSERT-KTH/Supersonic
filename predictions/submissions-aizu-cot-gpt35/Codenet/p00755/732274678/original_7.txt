Step 1: Remove unnecessary includes

The program includes <string.h> and <string> headers but does not use any functions or classes from them. Therefore, we can remove these includes.

Step 2: Remove unused variables

The variable "nc" is declared and assigned a value but is never used. We can remove this variable.

Step 3: Avoid unnecessary copying of vectors

In the "on" function, the "temp" vector is assigned the value of "N" before calling the "calc" function. However, "temp" is a global variable and there is no need to copy "N" into it. We can directly pass "N" to the "calc" function.

Step 4: Avoid unnecessary memset

In the "on" function, the "used" array is set to false using memset. However, the array is already declared as a local variable and C++ guarantees that all elements of the array are initialized to false by default. Therefore, we can remove the memset call.

Step 5: Avoid unnecessary redeclaration of variables

In the "on" function, there is a variable "tres" declared inside the while loop which shadows the global variable "tres". This redeclaration is unnecessary and can be removed.

Step 6: Avoid unnecessary recursion

In the "on" function, there is a recursive call to "on" with the same parameters when "count" is equal to 4. This recursive call is unnecessary as it will have the same effect as calling "on" with "count" incremented by 1 and "c" set to "Col". We can remove this recursive call and directly call "on" with "count" incremented by 1 and "c" set to "Col".

Step 7: Avoid unnecessary queue operations

In the "on" function, the queue "Q" is used to perform a breadth-first search. However, the queue is only used to check if a cell has been visited before. We can achieve the same result by using a boolean 2D array "used" to keep track of visited cells. This will eliminate the need for queue operations and improve performance.

Optimized program:

```
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int w, h, Col;
typedef vector<vector<int>> P;
P V;
int dx[4] = {0, 1, 0, -1};
int dy[4] = {1, 0, -1, 0};
int res;

void calc(P& N, int y, int x) {
  if (y < 0 || x < 0 || x >= w || y >= h)
    return;
  if (N[y][x] == Col) {
    res++;
    N[y][x] = 0;
    for (int r = 0; r < 4; r++)
      calc(N, y + dy[r], x + dx[r]);
  }
}

void on(P& N, int count, int c) {
  if (count == 5) {
    P temp = N;
    int tres = 0;
    calc(temp, 0, 0);
    res = max(res, tres);
    return;
  }
  bool used[8][8] = {false};
  for (int y = 0; y < h; y++) {
    for (int x = 0; x < w; x++) {
      if (used[y][x])
        continue;
      int nc = N[y][x];
      if (nc == c) {
        used[y][x] = true;
        N[y][x] = c;
        for (int r = 0; r < 4; r++) {
          int ny = y + dy[r], nx = x + dx[r];
          if (ny < 0 || nx < 0 || ny >= h || nx >= w)
            continue;
          if (N[ny][nx] == nc)
            used[ny][nx] = true;
        }
        on(N, count + 1, i);
        N[y][x] = nc;
      }
    }
  }
  on(N, count + 1, Col);
}

void solve() {
  res = 0;
  V.clear();
  V.resize(h);
  for (int y = 0; y < h; y++) {
    for (int x = 0; x < w; x++) {
      int t;
      cin >> t;
      V[y].push_back(t);
    }
  }
  for (int i = 1; i <= 6; i++) {
    if (V[0][0] != i)
      on(V, 0, i);
  }
  cout << res << endl;
}

int main() {
  while (cin >> h >> w >> Col) {
    if (w == 0)
      break;
    solve();
  }
  return 0;
}
