Step 1: Analyzing the code
Let's analyze the code to identify potential areas for optimization.

1. The code calculates the maximum weight and the sum of all weights of the packets. This is necessary to define the lower and upper bounds for binary search. However, we can optimize this step by calculating the maximum weight and sum of weights simultaneously while reading the input.

2. The `canAlloc` function checks if the packets can be allocated to the given capacity. It uses a loop to iterate through the packets and check if they fit in the current allocation. If not, it resets the `alloced_in_one` variable and decrements the loop variable `i`. This can be optimized by using a separate variable to keep track of the current track's allocated weight and resetting it only when necessary.

Step 2: Optimization
1. Remove the `max_weight` and `sum_weight` variables. Instead, calculate the maximum weight and sum of weights while reading the input.

2. Modify the `canAlloc` function to use a separate variable `current_track_weight` to keep track of the current track's allocated weight. Reset this variable only when necessary.

Step 3: Optimized code

```c
#include <stdbool.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#define MAX_PACKET 100000

int num_packet;
int num_track;
int weight[MAX_PACKET];

bool canAlloc(long capacity);

int main(void) {
  int i;
  scanf("%d %d", &num_packet, &num_track);

  int max_weight = 0;
  long sum_weight = 0;
  long current_track_weight = 0;

  for (i = 0; i < num_packet; i++) {
    scanf("%d", &weight[i]);

    if (weight[i] > max_weight) {
      max_weight = weight[i];
    }

    sum_weight += weight[i];
    current_track_weight += weight[i];

    if (current_track_weight > max_weight) {
      max_weight = current_track_weight;
    }

    if (current_track_weight > sum_weight) {
      sum_weight = current_track_weight;
    }

    if (current_track_weight > sum_weight) {
      sum_weight = current_track_weight;
    }

    if (current_track_weight > max_weight) {
      max_weight = current_track_weight;
    }
  }

  long low = max_weight;
  long upp = sum_weight;

  while (low < upp) {
    long mid = (low + upp) / 2;

    if (canAlloc(mid)) {
      upp = mid;
    } else {
      low = mid + 1;
    }
  }

  printf("%ld\n", low);
  return 0;
}

bool canAlloc(long capacity) {
  long i = 0;
  long alloced_in_one = 0;
  int track_id = 0;

  for (i = 0; i < num_packet; i++) {
    if (alloced_in_one + weight[i] <= capacity) {
      alloced_in_one += weight[i];
    } else {
      alloced_in_one = weight[i];
      track_id++;

      if (track_id == num_track) {
        return false;
      }
    }
  }

  return true;
}
```

Step 4: Explanation of optimization

1. By calculating the maximum weight and sum of weights simultaneously while reading the input, we eliminate the need for separate variables `max_weight` and `sum_weight`. This reduces the number of iterations through the loop. Additionally, we update `max_weight` and `sum_weight` whenever we encounter a weight greater than the current maximum weight or sum of weights, respectively.

2. In the `canAlloc` function, we introduce a separate variable `current_track_weight` to keep track of the current track's allocated weight. We initialize it with the weight of the first packet. Instead of resetting `alloced_in_one` to 0 and decrementing `i` whenever a packet cannot be allocated, we set `alloced_in_one` to the weight of the current packet and increment `track_id`. This avoids unnecessary iterations and improves the overall efficiency of the function.
