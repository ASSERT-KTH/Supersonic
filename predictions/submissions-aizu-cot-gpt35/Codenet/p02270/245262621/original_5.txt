Optimization Step 1: Reduce unnecessary includes

The program includes the `<stdbool.h>` header file, which is not used in the program. This can be removed to reduce unnecessary dependencies.

Optimization Step 2: Use more appropriate data types

The program uses `long` data type for some variables, even though they can be represented by `int` data type. Using `int` instead of `long` can reduce memory usage.

Optimization Step 3: Minimize variable scope

The variables `i`, `low`, `upp`, `mid`, `alloced_in_one`, and `track_id` are declared outside the loops and functions where they are used. This increases the scope of the variables and can lead to potential bugs or confusion. By declaring the variables inside the appropriate loops or functions, we can minimize their scope and make the code more readable.

Optimization Step 4: Use a more efficient algorithm

The current program uses a binary search algorithm to find the minimum capacity that can allocate all the packets. This is an efficient approach. However, the program can be further optimized by using a more efficient algorithm called "First Fit Decreasing". This algorithm sorts the packets in descending order of weight and allocates them to the tracks in a "first-fit" manner. This algorithm has a better time complexity than the binary search approach.

Optimization Step 5: Use a more efficient sorting algorithm

To implement the "First Fit Decreasing" algorithm, the program needs to sort the packets in descending order of weight. The current program does not implement any sorting algorithm. We can optimize the program by using a more efficient sorting algorithm such as quicksort or mergesort.

Here is the optimized program:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

#define MAX_PACKET 100000

int num_packet;
int num_track;
int weight[MAX_PACKET];

bool canAlloc(int capacity);

void swap(int* a, int* b) {
  int temp = *a;
  *a = *b;
  *b = temp;
}

int partition(int arr[], int low, int high) {
  int pivot = arr[high];
  int i = (low - 1);

  for (int j = low; j <= high - 1; j++) {
    if (arr[j] > pivot) {
      i++;
      swap(&arr[i], &arr[j]);
    }
  }

  swap(&arr[i + 1], &arr[high]);
  return (i + 1);
}

void quicksort(int arr[], int low, int high) {
  if (low < high) {
    int pi = partition(arr, low, high);

    quicksort(arr, low, pi - 1);
    quicksort(arr, pi + 1, high);
  }
}

int main(void) {
  scanf("%d %d", &num_packet, &num_track);

  int max_weight = 0;
  int sum_weight = 0;

  for (int i = 0; i < num_packet; i++) {
    scanf("%d", &weight[i]);
    if (weight[i] > max_weight) {
      max_weight = weight[i];
    }
    sum_weight += weight[i];
  }

  quicksort(weight, 0, num_packet - 1);

  int low = max_weight;
  int upp = sum_weight;

  while (low < upp) {
    int mid = (low + upp) / 2;
    if (canAlloc(mid)) {
      upp = mid;
    } else {
      low = mid + 1;
    }
  }

  printf("%d\n", low);
  return 0;
}

bool canAlloc(int capacity) {
  int alloced_in_one = 0;
  int track_id = 0;

  for (int i = 0; i < num_packet; i++) {
    if (alloced_in_one + weight[i] <= capacity) {
      alloced_in_one += weight[i];
    } else {
      alloced_in_one = 0;
      i--;
      if (++track_id == num_track) {
        return false;
      }
    }
  }

  return true;
}
```
