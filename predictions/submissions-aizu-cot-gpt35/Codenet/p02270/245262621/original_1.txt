Step 1: Reduce the number of iterations in the `canAlloc` function.

Explanation: The `canAlloc` function checks if it is possible to allocate the packets into the given number of tracks. Currently, it iterates through all the packets and checks if each packet can be allocated in the current track. However, we can optimize this by skipping iterations when we know that the remaining packets cannot be allocated in the current track.

Optimization: Instead of iterating through all the packets, we can iterate until `num_packet - num_track + track_id`. This is because if we have `num_packet - num_track + track_id` packets remaining, and each packet has a weight greater than the capacity, it is not possible to allocate the remaining packets in the current track.

Step 2: Remove the unnecessary decrement and increment operations in the `canAlloc` function.

Explanation: Currently, when a packet cannot be allocated in the current track, the function decrements `i` and increments `track_id`. However, this is unnecessary because the `for` loop already increments `i` in the next iteration and the next track is selected in the next iteration.

Optimization: Remove the `i--` operation and the unnecessary `track_id++` operation.

Step 3: Use the `long long` data type for the `alloced_in_one` variable.

Explanation: The `alloced_in_one` variable keeps track of the total weight allocated in the current track. However, in the current implementation, it is of type `long`, which may not be sufficient to handle large weights. We can use the `long long` data type to ensure that we can handle large weights.

Optimization: Change the type of `alloced_in_one` from `long` to `long long`.

Here is the optimized code:

```c
#include <stdbool.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#define MAX_PACKET 100000
int num_packet;
int num_track;
int weight[MAX_PACKET];
bool canAlloc(long long capacity);
int main(void) {
  int i;
  scanf("%d %d", &num_packet, &num_track);
  int max_weight = 0;
  long long sum_weight = 0;
  for (i = 0; i < num_packet; i++) {
    scanf("%d", &weight[i]);
    if (weight[i] > max_weight) {
      max_weight = weight[i];
    }
    sum_weight += weight[i];
  }
  long long low = max_weight;
  long long upp = sum_weight;
  while (low < upp) {
    long long mid = (low + upp) / 2;
    if (canAlloc(mid)) {
      upp = mid;
    } else {
      low = mid + 1;
    }
  }
  printf("%lld\n", low);
  return 0;
}
bool canAlloc(long long capacity) {
  int i = 0;
  long long alloced_in_one = 0;
  int track_id = 0;
  for (i = 0; i < num_packet - num_track + track_id; i++) {
    if (alloced_in_one + weight[i] <= capacity) {
      alloced_in_one += weight[i];
    } else {
      alloced_in_one = 0;
      if (++track_id == num_track) {
        return false;
      }
    }
  }
  return true;
}
```
