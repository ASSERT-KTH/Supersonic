Step 1: Remove unnecessary includes
The program includes the `stdbool.h` header file but does not use any of the boolean types. We can remove this include statement.

Step 2: Optimize the input loop
The current input loop reads the weight of each packet one by one and calculates the maximum weight and sum of all weights in separate steps. We can optimize this by calculating the maximum weight and sum of weights in a single loop.

Step 3: Optimize the binary search
The binary search algorithm is correct, but it can be optimized by using a more efficient method to calculate the `mid` value. Currently, the `mid` value is calculated as `(low + upp) / 2`, but this can cause overflow if `low` and `upp` are large numbers. We can modify the calculation to `low + (upp - low) / 2` to avoid the overflow.

Step 4: Optimize the allocation loop
The allocation loop can be optimized by removing the `alloced_in_one` variable and using the `capacity` directly. We can also remove the `track_id` variable and use a counter to track the number of tracks allocated.

Here is the optimized C/C++ program:

```cpp
#include <stdio.h>

#define MAX_PACKET 100000

int num_packet;
int num_track;
int weight[MAX_PACKET];

bool canAlloc(long capacity);

int main(void) {
  scanf("%d %d", &num_packet, &num_track);

  int max_weight = 0;
  long sum_weight = 0;

  for (int i = 0; i < num_packet; i++) {
    scanf("%d", &weight[i]);
    max_weight = (weight[i] > max_weight) ? weight[i] : max_weight;
    sum_weight += weight[i];
  }

  long low = max_weight;
  long upp = sum_weight;

  while (low < upp) {
    long mid = low + (upp - low) / 2;
    if (canAlloc(mid)) {
      upp = mid;
    } else {
      low = mid + 1;
    }
  }

  printf("%ld\n", low);
  return 0;
}

bool canAlloc(long capacity) {
  int counter = 0;
  long remaining_capacity = capacity;

  for (int i = 0; i < num_packet; i++) {
    if (weight[i] > capacity) {
      return false;
    }

    if (weight[i] <= remaining_capacity) {
      remaining_capacity -= weight[i];
    } else {
      remaining_capacity = capacity - weight[i];
      if (++counter == num_track) {
        return false;
      }
    }
  }

  return true;
}
```
