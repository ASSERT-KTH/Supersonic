Step 1: Remove unnecessary header file
- The program includes the `<stdbool.h>` header file, but it is not used anywhere in the code. Therefore, we can remove this line to optimize the program.

Step 2: Optimize the loop in the `canAlloc` function
- Currently, the loop in the `canAlloc` function uses a variable `i` to iterate through the packets. However, this variable is also used to keep track of the current packet index. This causes the loop to unnecessarily iterate multiple times when a packet cannot be allocated to the current track.
- To optimize this, we can introduce a new variable `j` to iterate through the packets, and use `i` to keep track of the current packet index. This way, we don't need to decrement `i` when a packet cannot be allocated to the current track.

Step 3: Modify the condition in the `canAlloc` function
- Currently, the condition `if (alloced_in_one + weight[i] <= capacity)` checks if the current packet can be allocated to the current track. If it is not possible, the code resets `alloced_in_one` to 0 and decrements `i`.
- However, this approach leads to unnecessary iterations and can be optimized.
- We can modify the condition to `if (alloced_in_one + weight[j] > capacity)`, and then break the loop. This way, we don't need to decrement `i` and the loop will continue with the next packet.

Step 4: Optimize the binary search loop in the `main` function
- The while loop in the `main` function performs a binary search to find the minimum capacity that can be allocated to the tracks.
- However, the current implementation checks the condition `if (canAlloc(mid))` for each `mid` value, which results in multiple calls to the `canAlloc` function.
- We can optimize this by calculating the `canAlloc` result only once for the initial `mid` value (i.e., `mid = (low + upp) / 2;`) and storing it in a variable. Then, inside the loop, we can update the `low` or `upp` value based on this stored result.

Here is the optimized C program:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

#define MAX_PACKET 100000

int num_packet;
int num_track;
int weight[MAX_PACKET];

bool canAlloc(long capacity);

int main(void) {
  int i;

  scanf("%d %d", &num_packet, &num_track);

  int max_weight = 0;
  long sum_weight = 0;

  for (i = 0; i < num_packet; i++) {
    scanf("%d", &weight[i]);

    if (weight[i] > max_weight) {
      max_weight = weight[i];
    }

    sum_weight += weight[i];
  }

  long low = max_weight;
  long upp = sum_weight;
  bool initialResult = canAlloc((low + upp) / 2);

  while (low < upp) {
    long mid = (low + upp) / 2;

    if (initialResult) {
      upp = mid;
    } else {
      low = mid + 1;
    }

    initialResult = canAlloc(mid);
  }

  printf("%ld\n", low);
  return 0;
}

bool canAlloc(long capacity) {
  long i = 0;
  long alloced_in_one = 0;
  int track_id = 0;

  for (long j = 0; j < num_packet; j++) {
    if (alloced_in_one + weight[j] > capacity) {
      break;
    }

    alloced_in_one += weight[j];

    if (++track_id == num_track) {
      return false;
    }
  }

  return true;
}
```

With these optimizations, the program's running time and memory usage should be improved.
