The given program is using a binary search algorithm to find the minimum weight that can be assigned to each worker such that each worker carries at most that weight. The program iterates through different weights using a binary search approach and checks if all the workers can be assigned their loads with that weight.

To optimize the program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove the unnecessary inclusion of `<cstdio>` and `<iostream>` headers. Since we are using C++ streams for input and output, the `<cstdio>` header is not needed.

2. Remove the `using namespace std;` statement. It is considered a bad practice to include the entire `std` namespace and may lead to naming conflicts. Instead, we will use the `std::` prefix for standard library functions and objects.

3. Change the function signature of `check()` to take the array `N` as a constant reference. This will avoid creating a copy of the array during function calls, reducing memory usage.

4. Replace the C-style array `N[n]` with `std::vector<int> N(n)`. Using `std::vector` provides better memory management and allows for dynamic resizing if needed.

5. Use `std::cin` and `std::cout` for input and output instead of `scanf` and `printf`. This will provide a more robust and type-safe input/output mechanism.

6. Replace the calculation of `mid` in the binary search loop with `(left + right) >> 1` to improve performance. The right shift operator is equivalent to dividing by 2 and is faster for integer division.

7. Change the binary search loop condition to `while (left <= right)` to handle the case when `left` and `right` become equal, ensuring the loop breaks correctly.

8. Replace the `cout << right << endl;` statement with `std::cout << right << '\n';` to avoid unnecessary flushing of the output buffer.

Here is the optimized C++ program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

int check(const std::vector<int>& N, int n, int k, int w) {
  int i = 0;
  for (int j = 0; j < k; ++j) {
    int s = 0;
    while (s + N[i] <= w) {
      s += N[i];
      ++i;
      if (i == n)
        return n;
    }
  }
  return i;
}

int main() {
  int MAX_W = 1000000000;
  int n, k;
  std::cin >> n >> k;
  std::vector<int> N(n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    std::cin >> N[i];
  }
  int left = 0;
  int right = MAX_W;
  while (left <= right) {
    int mid = (left + right) >> 1;
    if (check(N, n, k, mid) == n) {
      right = mid - 1;
    } else {
      left = mid + 1;
    }
  }
  std::cout << right + 1 << '\n';
  return 0;
}
```

These optimizations improve the performance and memory usage of the program while retaining its functionality.
