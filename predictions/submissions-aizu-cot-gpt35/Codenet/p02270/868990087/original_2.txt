The given program finds the maximum weight capacity that can be carried by k trucks, given the weight of each item and the number of items.

The program uses a binary search algorithm to find the maximum weight capacity. It starts with the range of [0, MAX_W] and repeatedly halves the range until it finds the maximum weight capacity that can be carried by k trucks.

To optimize the program for running time and memory usage, we can make the following modifications:

1. Instead of using the `iostream` and `cstdio` libraries, we can use the more efficient `stdio.h` library for input and output operations.

2. We can remove the `using namespace std;` statement to avoid unnecessary namespace pollution.

3. We can replace the `scanf` function calls with the more efficient `fscanf` function calls.

4. Instead of using dynamic memory allocation for the array `N`, we can use a fixed-size array with a maximum size of `n`.

5. We can use integer division (`/ 2`) instead of floating-point division (`/`) when calculating the middle index in the binary search algorithm.

Here is the optimized C program:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int check(int N[], int n, int k, int w) {
  int i = 0;
  for (int j = 0; j < k; ++j) {
    int s = 0;
    while (s + N[i] <= w) {
      s += N[i];
      ++i;
      if (i == n)
        return n;
    }
  }
  return i;
}

int main() {
  int MAX_W = 1000000000;
  int n, k;
  fscanf(stdin, "%d %d", &n, &k);
  int N[n];
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    fscanf(stdin, "%d", &N[i]);
  }
  int left = 0;
  int right = MAX_W;
  while (left < right) {
    int mid = (left + right) / 2;
    if (check(N, n, k, mid) == n) {
      right = mid;
    } else {
      left = mid + 1;
    }
  }
  fprintf(stdout, "%d\n", right);
  return 0;
}
```

These modifications should improve the running time and memory usage of the program.
