The given program performs a binary search on the range of possible values for the variable "right" to determine the maximum weight that can be assigned to each group, such that all items can be evenly distributed among the groups.

To optimize the program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The program includes <cstdio> and <iostream>, but only uses the scanf and cout functions. We can remove the <cstdio> include since <iostream> already includes it.

2. Avoid unnecessary array initialization: In the main function, the array N[] is initialized with the size n, but its elements are immediately overwritten by the values read from input. We can remove the array initialization to save memory.

3. Use integer division instead of floating-point division: In the binary search loop, the line "int mid = (left + right) / 2;" performs floating-point division, which can be slower than integer division. We can use integer division by using the "//" operator instead.

4. Optimize the binary search condition: The condition "check(N, n, k, mid) == n" is checked in each iteration of the binary search loop. Instead of calling the check function, we can use the value of "i" returned by the check function directly in the loop condition to avoid the function call.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int check(int N[], int n, int k, int w) {
  int i = 0;
  for (int j = 0; j < k; ++j) {
    int s = 0;
    while (s + N[i] <= w) {
      s += N[i];
      ++i;
      if (i == n)
        return n;
    }
  }
  return i;
}

int main() {
  int MAX_W = 1000000000;
  int n, k;
  cin >> n >> k;
  int N[n];
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    cin >> N[i];
  }
  int left = 0;
  int right = MAX_W;
  while (left < right) {
    int mid = (left + right) // 2;
    int i = check(N, n, k, mid);
    if (i == n) {
      right = mid;
    } else {
      left = mid + 1;
    }
  }
  cout << right << endl;
  return 0;
}
```
