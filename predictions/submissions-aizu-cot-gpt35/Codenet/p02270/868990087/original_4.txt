Step 1: Avoid unnecessary include statements

The program includes the `<iostream>` header file but does not use any of its functionalities. We can remove this include statement to improve compile time.

Step 2: Optimize the `check` function

The `check` function is currently implemented using a nested loop. However, we can optimize this function by using a single loop and keeping track of the sum of the elements in a separate variable. This will eliminate the need for the inner while loop and improve the running time.

Step 3: Use a more efficient algorithm for the binary search

The binary search algorithm used in the main function can be further optimized. Instead of checking if the result of `check` is equal to `n`, we can check if it is greater than or equal to `n`. This is because the result will always be greater than or equal to `n` if `right` is the correct answer. Additionally, we can initialize `right` to `MAX_W + 1` instead of `MAX_W` to account for the case when `right` is the correct answer.

Step 4: Avoid unnecessary variables

The variable `s` in the `check` function is used only within the while loop and can be eliminated. We can directly update `N[i]` instead of using `s` to keep track of the sum.

Here is the optimized code:

```c++
#include <cstdio>

int check(int N[], int n, int k, int w) {
  int i = 0;
  int sum = 0;
  for (int j = 0; j < k; ++j) {
    sum += N[i];
    if (sum > w) {
      ++i;
      sum = N[i];
    }
    if (i == n) {
      return n;
    }
  }
  return i;
}

int main() {
  int MAX_W = 1000000000;
  int n, k;
  scanf("%d %d", &n, &k);
  int N[n];
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    scanf("%d", &N[i]);
  }
  int left = 0;
  int right = MAX_W + 1;
  while (left < right) {
    int mid = (left + right) / 2;
    if (check(N, n, k, mid) >= n) {
      right = mid;
    } else {
      left = mid + 1;
    }
  }
  printf("%d\n", right);
  return 0;
}
```
