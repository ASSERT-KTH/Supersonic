The given program takes an input of n integers and divides them into k groups such that the sum of each group is as equal as possible. The program calculates the minimum sum that each group can have and outputs it.

To optimize this program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Instead of using a vector to store the input, we can use a simple array since the size is fixed and known beforehand. This will reduce the memory usage.

2. We can pass the array and the size of the array as parameters to the functions instead of using global variables. This will make the code more modular and efficient.

3. Instead of using the accumulate function to calculate the sum of the array, we can calculate it manually in a loop. This will avoid the overhead of function calls.

4. Instead of using a while loop to increment P until IsAllLoaded returns true, we can use a binary search approach to find the minimum value of P. This will reduce the number of iterations required.

5. We can remove the unnecessary TrackIndex variable and the check for TrackIndex == k in the IsAllLoaded function since it is not used.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int* Input(const int n) {
  int* W = new int[n];
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> W[i];
  }
  return W;
}

bool IsAllLoaded(int P, int* W, int n) {
  int CurrentSum = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    if (W[i] > P) {
      return false;
    }
    if (CurrentSum + W[i] > P) {
      CurrentSum = 0;
    }
    CurrentSum += W[i];
  }
  return true;
}

int Calc(int* W, int n, int k) {
  int Sum = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    Sum += W[i];
  }
  int low = (Sum + k - 1) / k;
  int high = Sum;
  int result = high;

  while (low <= high) {
    int mid = low + (high - low) / 2;
    if (IsAllLoaded(mid, W, n)) {
      result = mid;
      high = mid - 1;
    } else {
      low = mid + 1;
    }
  }

  return result;
}

int main() {
  int n, k;
  cin >> n >> k;
  int* W = Input(n);
  int P = Calc(W, n, k);
  cout << P << endl;
  delete[] W;
  return 0;
}
```

Explanation of the optimization steps:

1. Replaced the vector<int> with int* to reduce memory usage.

2. Modified the Input function to use an array instead of a vector.

3. Updated the IsAllLoaded function to take an array and its size as parameters.

4. Removed the unnecessary TrackIndex variable and the check for TrackIndex == k in the IsAllLoaded function.

5. Calculated the sum of the array manually in the Calc function instead of using the accumulate function.

6. Implemented a binary search approach in the Calc function to find the minimum value of P.

7. Added the delete[] statement to free the memory allocated for the array.
