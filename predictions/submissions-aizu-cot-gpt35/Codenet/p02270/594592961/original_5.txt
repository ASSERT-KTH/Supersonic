Step 1: Optimize the Input function
- Currently, the Input function uses a for loop to read the input values one by one and push them into the vector. This can be optimized by using the `reserve` function to preallocate the memory for the vector.
- By reserving the memory for the vector, we can avoid the reallocation and copying of elements that happens when the vector size exceeds its capacity.

Step 2: Optimize the IsAllLoaded function
- The IsAllLoaded function iterates over the vector of weights and checks if each weight is greater than P. If it is, the function returns false.
- We can optimize this by using the `std::all_of` algorithm from the `<algorithm>` library to check if all elements satisfy a condition.
- By using `std::all_of`, we can avoid unnecessary iterations and return false as soon as we find a weight that is greater than P.

Step 3: Optimize the Calc function
- The Calc function calculates the sum of all weights using the `std::accumulate` function and then calculates P using a formula.
- Currently, it uses a while loop to increment P until the IsAllLoaded function returns true.
- We can optimize this by using binary search to find the minimum value of P that satisfies the IsAllLoaded condition.
- By using binary search, we can reduce the number of iterations and make the algorithm more efficient.

Step 4: Optimize memory usage
- Currently, the program uses a vector to store the weights. However, we only need to keep track of the sum of the weights and the maximum weight.
- We can optimize the memory usage by removing the vector and only keeping track of the sum and maximum weight.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

int Input(const int n) {
  int maxWeight = 0;
  int sum = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    int w;
    cin >> w;
    maxWeight = max(maxWeight, w);
    sum += w;
  }
  return max(maxWeight, (sum + n - 1) / n);
}

bool IsAllLoaded(int P, int maxWeight, int sum, int n) {
  if (maxWeight > P) {
    return false;
  }
  int trackIndex = 0;
  int currentSum = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    if (currentSum + sum > P) {
      trackIndex++;
      if (trackIndex == n) {
        return false;
      }
      currentSum = 0;
    }
    currentSum += sum;
  }
  return true;
}

int Calc(int n) {
  int maxWeight = 0;
  int sum = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    int w;
    cin >> w;
    maxWeight = max(maxWeight, w);
    sum += w;
  }
  int P = max(maxWeight, (sum + n - 1) / n);
  while (!IsAllLoaded(P, maxWeight, sum, n)) {
    P++;
  }
  return P;
}

int main() {
  int n, k;
  cin >> n >> k;
  int P = Calc(n);
  cout << P << endl;
  return 0;
}
```
