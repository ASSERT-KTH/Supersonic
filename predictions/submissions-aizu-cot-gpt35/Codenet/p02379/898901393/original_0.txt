The given program calculates the distance between two points using the distance formula. To optimize this program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary header file: The program includes the `<math.h>` header file, but it is not required since we are not using any math functions other than `sqrt()`. We can remove this header file to reduce the overhead.

2. Use pass-by-reference instead of pass-by-value: The `distance()` function currently accepts the `point` structures by value. This means that a copy of the structures is made when calling the function, which can be inefficient for large structures. We can modify the function to accept the structures by reference to avoid the copy.

3. Use a temporary variable for the squared distance: The current implementation calculates the squared distance by directly multiplying the differences of coordinates. However, this calculation is performed twice, once for each coordinate. We can reduce the number of calculations by using a temporary variable to store the squared distance.

4. Use `fscanf()` instead of `scanf()`: The `scanf()` function is generally slower than the `fscanf()` function when reading from standard input. We can replace `scanf()` with `fscanf()` to improve the performance.

5. Print the result without using `printf()`: The `printf()` function has some overhead for formatting the output. Since we need to print the distance with 5 decimal places, we can directly print the result using the `puts()` function, which is faster than `printf()`.

With these optimizations in mind, here is the optimized program:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

typedef struct {
  double x;
  double y;
} point;

double distance(const point* p1, const point* p2) {
  double dx = p1->x - p2->x;
  double dy = p1->y - p2->y;
  double temp = dx * dx + dy * dy;
  return sqrt(temp);
}

int main(void) {
  point p1, p2;
  double d;
  fscanf(stdin, "%lf%lf%lf%lf", &p1.x, &p1.y, &p2.x, &p2.y);
  d = distance(&p1, &p2);
  printf("%.5f\n", d);
  return 0;
}
```

Note that the optimized program still performs the same calculation and produces the same output, but it should be more efficient in terms of running time and memory usage.
