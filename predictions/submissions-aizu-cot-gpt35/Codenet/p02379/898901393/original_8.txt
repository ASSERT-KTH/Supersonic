The given program calculates the distance between two points using the Euclidean distance formula. To optimize the program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unused header file: The `math.h` header file is included but not used in the program. We can remove it to reduce unnecessary includes.

2. Remove unnecessary variable: The `temp` variable in the `distance` function is not needed. We can directly calculate the distance and return the result.

3. Avoid unnecessary multiplication: The expression `(p1.x - p2.x) * (p1.x - p2.x)` and `(p1.y - p2.y) * (p1.y - p2.y)` is calculated twice. We can calculate them once and store the result in variables to avoid redundant calculations.

4. Use `const` reference for function parameter: The `distance` function is currently passing the `point` structs by value, which involves copying the structs. We can pass them by `const` reference to avoid unnecessary copying.

Here is the optimized program:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

typedef struct point {
  double x;
  double y;
} point;

double distance(const point& p1, const point& p2) {
  double x_diff = p1.x - p2.x;
  double y_diff = p1.y - p2.y;
  double temp = x_diff * x_diff + y_diff * y_diff;
  return sqrt(temp);
}

int main(void) {
  point p1, p2;
  double d;
  scanf("%lf%lf%lf%lf", &p1.x, &p1.y, &p2.x, &p2.y);
  d = distance(p1, p2);
  printf("%.5f\n", d);
  return 0;
}
```

These optimizations will improve the runtime and memory usage of the program.
