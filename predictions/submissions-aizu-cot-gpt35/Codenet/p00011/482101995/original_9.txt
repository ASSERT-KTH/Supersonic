The given program reads an integer `w` representing the width of a line and an integer `n` representing the number of swaps to be performed. It then initializes a vector `StartingPoint` with values from 1 to `w`. It reads `n` pairs of integers representing the left and right indices of the swaps, and performs the swaps in the `StartingPoint` vector accordingly. Finally, it prints the elements of the `StartingPoint` vector.

To optimize the program, we can eliminate the unnecessary use of the `THorizonalLine` struct and the `Dummy` character variable. We can directly use the left and right indices of the swaps to perform the swap operation on the `StartingPoint` vector. This will reduce the memory usage and eliminate the need for unnecessary variable assignments.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int w;
  cin >> w;
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  vector<int> StartingPoint(w);
  for (int i = 0; i < w; i++) {
    StartingPoint[i] = i + 1;
  }
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    int left, right;
    cin >> left >> right;
    swap(StartingPoint[left - 1], StartingPoint[right - 1]);
  }
  for (int i = 0; i < w; i++) {
    cout << StartingPoint[i] << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized program eliminates the unnecessary use of `THorizonalLine` struct and the `Dummy` character variable. It directly uses the left and right indices of the swaps to perform the swap operation on the `StartingPoint` vector.
