The given program reads an integer `w`, which represents the length of a line segment, and an integer `n`, which represents the number of horizontal lines to be drawn on the line segment. The program then swaps the starting points of these horizontal lines on the line segment and outputs the final positions of the starting points.

To optimize this program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary include statements: The `<iostream>` and `<vector>` headers are not used in the program. We can remove them.

2. Avoid using `using namespace std;`: It is considered good practice to avoid using `using namespace std;` as it pollutes the global namespace. Instead, we can use the `std::` prefix when using standard library functions and types.

3. Use `reserve` for the `StartingPoint` vector: Since we know the size of the vector in advance (`w`), we can use the `reserve` function to allocate memory for the vector. This avoids multiple reallocations during the loop.

4. Avoid unnecessary initialization in the `StartingPoint` vector: Instead of initializing the `StartingPoint` vector with consecutive numbers, we can directly assign the values during the swapping process. This saves unnecessary iterations.

5. Use `'\n'` instead of `std::endl`: The `std::endl` manipulator flushes the output stream, which can be an expensive operation. We can use the `'\n'` character instead to simply print a newline.

Here's the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

struct THorizonalLine {
  int Left;
  int Right;
};

int main() {
  int w;
  std::cin >> w;

  int n;
  std::cin >> n;

  std::vector<int> StartingPoint;
  StartingPoint.reserve(w);

  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    THorizonalLine HorizonalLine;
    char Dummy;
    std::cin >> HorizonalLine.Left >> Dummy >> HorizonalLine.Right;
    std::swap(StartingPoint[HorizonalLine.Left - 1], StartingPoint[HorizonalLine.Right - 1]);
  }

  for (int i = 0; i < w; i++) {
    std::cout << StartingPoint[i] << '\n';
  }

  return 0;
}
```
