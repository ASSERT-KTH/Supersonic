The given program calculates the minimum number of coins needed to make a sum of "n" using a set of "m" different coins. The program uses a dynamic programming approach to solve this problem.

To optimize the program, we can make the following changes:
1. Remove unnecessary headers: The `math.h` header is not being used in the program, so it can be removed.
2. Use `std::cin` and `std::cout` directly: The program currently imports the entire `std` namespace, which is not recommended. We can use `std::cin` and `std::cout` directly without importing the entire namespace.
3. Use `std::vector` instead of fixed-size arrays: Instead of using fixed-size arrays for `c` and `mini`, we can use `std::vector` to dynamically allocate memory as needed. This will allow us to handle larger inputs without running into memory issues.
4. Use `std::min` instead of `min`: The program currently uses `min` to find the minimum value. We can use `std::min` instead, which is more efficient and avoids potential naming conflicts.
5. Use `std::fill` instead of a loop to initialize `mini` array: Instead of using a loop to initialize the `mini` array to `INF`, we can use `std::fill` to set all elements of the array to `INF` in a single line.
6. Use prefix increment instead of postfix increment: In the first `for` loop, we can use prefix increment (`++i`) instead of postfix increment (`i++`) for better performance.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

const int INF = 2000000000;

int main() {
  int n, m;
  std::cin >> n >> m;
  
  std::vector<int> c(m + 1);
  for (int i = 1; i <= m; ++i) {
    std::cin >> c[i];
  }
  
  std::sort(c.begin() + 1, c.end());
  
  std::vector<int> mini(n + 1, INF);
  mini[0] = 0;

  for (int i = 1; i <= m; ++i) {
    for (int j = 0; j <= n - c[i]; ++j) {
      mini[j + c[i]] = std::min(mini[j] + 1, mini[j + c[i]]);
    }
  }
  
  std::cout << mini[n] << std::endl;
  return 0;
}
```

These optimizations should improve the running time and memory usage of the program.
