The given program calculates the minimum number of coins required to make a total value of 'n' using a set of 'm' coins of different denominations.

To optimize the program, we can make the following changes:

1. Remove unnecessary headers: The program includes unnecessary headers such as <cstdio>, <iostream>, and <math.h>. Since these headers are not used in the program, we can remove them.

2. Remove the 'using namespace std' statement: This statement imports all the names from the 'std' namespace into the global namespace, which can lead to naming conflicts. Instead, we can use the 'std::' prefix when using names from the 'std' namespace.

3. Replace the 'INF' constant with 'INT_MAX': The 'INF' constant is defined as a large value of 2000000000. However, the 'INT_MAX' constant from the <climits> header already represents the maximum value for an integer. We can replace 'INF' with 'INT_MAX' for better code readability.

4. Use dynamic memory allocation for the 'c' and 'mini' arrays: Instead of using fixed-size arrays for 'c' and 'mini', we can use dynamic memory allocation to allocate memory based on the input values 'm' and 'n'. This will save memory usage when 'm' and 'n' are small.

5. Use 'std::vector' instead of arrays: Instead of using arrays, we can use 'std::vector' to store the values of 'c' and 'mini'. 'std::vector' provides dynamic size adjustment and better memory management compared to arrays.

With these optimizations in mind, here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <climits>

int main() {
  int n, m;
  std::cin >> n >> m;

  std::vector<int> c(m);
  std::vector<int> mini(n + 1, INT_MAX);

  for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
    std::cin >> c[i];
  }

  std::sort(c.begin(), c.end());

  mini[0] = 0;

  for (int i = 1; i <= m; i++) {
    for (int j = c[i - 1]; j <= n; j++) {
      mini[j] = std::min(mini[j], mini[j - c[i - 1]] + 1);
    }
  }

  std::cout << mini[n] << std::endl;

  return 0;
}
```

Explanation of optimization steps:

1. Removed unnecessary headers: The headers <cstdio>, <iostream>, and <math.h> were not used in the program, so they were removed.

2. Removed the 'using namespace std' statement: Instead of importing all names from the 'std' namespace into the global namespace, 'std::' prefix was used when using names from the 'std' namespace to prevent naming conflicts.

3. Replaced 'INF' constant with 'INT_MAX': The 'INF' constant was replaced with 'INT_MAX' from the <climits> header, which represents the maximum value for an integer.

4. Used dynamic memory allocation for 'c' and 'mini' arrays: Instead of using fixed-size arrays, 'std::vector' was used to dynamically allocate memory for 'c' and 'mini' based on input values 'm' and 'n'.

5. Used 'std::vector' instead of arrays: 'std::vector' was used to store the values of 'c' and 'mini'. 'std::vector' provides dynamic size adjustment and better memory management compared to arrays.
