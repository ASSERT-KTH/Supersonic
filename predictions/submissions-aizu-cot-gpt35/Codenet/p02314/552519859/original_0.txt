The given program is a dynamic programming solution to the Coin Change problem. The goal is to find the minimum number of coins required to make a certain amount using a given set of coin denominations.

To optimize the program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary headers: The program includes unnecessary headers `<cstdio>` and `<math.h>`. Since these headers are not used in the program, we can remove them.

2. Remove unused variable: The variable `n` is used to store the target amount. However, it is not used in the program. We can remove it.

3. Optimize array sizes: The array `mini` has a size of 50001, which is not necessary. We can reduce its size to `n + 1` since we only need to store values up to `n`.

4. Use a constant for loop bounds: The loop bounds in the second `for` loop can be optimized by using `m` as the loop bound instead of `1 + m`. This avoids unnecessary addition operations.

5. Use a constant for the maximum number of coins: The array `c` has a fixed size of 21, which is not necessary. We can replace it with a constant to make the code more readable.

Here is the optimized C++ program:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

const int MAX_COINS = 21;
const int INF = 2000000000;

int main() {
  int m;
  cin >> m;
  
  int c[MAX_COINS];
  for (int i = 1; i <= m; i++) {
    cin >> c[i];
  }
  
  sort(c + 1, c + m + 1);
  
  int n;
  cin >> n;

  int mini[n + 1];
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    mini[i] = INF;
  }
  
  for (int i = 1; i <= m; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j <= n - c[i]; j++) {
      mini[j + c[i]] = min(mini[j] + 1, mini[j + c[i]]);
    }
  }
  
  cout << mini[n] << endl;
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized version of the program improves the memory usage and loop bounds, resulting in a more efficient solution.
