Explanation of the optimization steps:

1. Avoid unnecessary includes: The program includes unnecessary headers such as `<cstdio>` and `<math.h>`. Since these headers are not used in the program, we can remove them.

2. Avoid using `using namespace std;`: The program uses `using namespace std;` directive. This can lead to namespace pollution and potential naming conflicts. It is better to explicitly qualify the standard library objects and functions with `std::`.

3. Use a more appropriate data type for `mini` array: The `mini` array is currently declared as `int mini[50001];`. However, the program only uses indices from 1 to `n` (inclusive). We can reduce the size of the array by declaring it as `int mini[n + 1];`.

4. Avoid unnecessary sorting: The program sorts the `c` array using `std::sort` function. However, since there is no requirement to output the sorted array, we can avoid this sorting step.

5. Optimize the inner loop: The inner loop in the program performs unnecessary iterations. It goes from 0 to `n - c[i]`, but there is no need to iterate over the entire range. We can optimize it by starting the loop from `c[i]` instead of 0.

6. Optimize the `min` function call: The program currently uses `mini[j + c[i]] = min(mini[j] + 1, mini[j + c[i]]);`. Since `mini[j + c[i]]` is assigned the same value in each iteration, we can store it in a separate variable and update `mini[j + c[i]]` at the end of the loop.

7. Remove unnecessary variable initialization: The elements of the `mini` array are initialized to `INF` using a loop. However, since we update all elements of `mini` in the loop, we can remove this initialization step.

Optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using std::cin;
using std::cout;
using std::endl;

const int INF = 2000000000;

int main() {
  int n, m;
  cin >> n >> m;

  int c[21];
  for (int i = 1; i <= m; i++) {
    cin >> c[i];
  }

  int mini[n + 1];
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    mini[i] = INF;
  }

  for (int i = 1; i <= m; i++) {
    for (int j = c[i]; j <= n; j++) {
      int temp = mini[j];
      mini[j] = std::min(mini[j], mini[j - c[i]] + 1);
      mini[j - c[i]] = temp;
    }
  }

  cout << mini[n] << endl;
  return 0;
}
```
