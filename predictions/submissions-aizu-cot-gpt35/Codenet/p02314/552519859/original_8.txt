Step 1: Remove unnecessary header files
The program includes the header files `cstdio` and `math.h`, but does not use any functions or constants from these headers. Therefore, we can remove these includes.

Step 2: Optimize the input process
The program reads the values of `n` and `m` separately using the `cin` stream. However, we can optimize this by reading the values together with a single statement. This reduces the number of input operations and improves the performance.

Step 3: Optimize the initialization of `mini` array
The program uses a loop to initialize the `mini` array with the value `INF`. However, we can optimize this by using the `memset()` function to set all elements of the array to `INF` in a single operation.

Step 4: Optimize the inner loop
The inner loop iterates from 0 to `n - c[i]`, which can be optimized by changing the loop condition to `j <= n - c[i]`. This eliminates the need to calculate `n - c[i]` in each iteration.

Step 5: Optimize the `min()` function call
The program uses the `min()` function to calculate the minimum value between `mini[j] + 1` and `mini[j + c[i]]`. However, we can optimize this by using a conditional statement to check if `mini[j] + 1` is smaller than `mini[j + c[i]]`, and update `mini[j + c[i]]` accordingly.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
const int INF = 2000000000;

int main() {
  int n, m;
  cin >> n >> m;
  int c[21];
  int mini[50001];
  for (int i = 1; i <= m; i++) {
    cin >> c[i];
  }
  sort(c + 1, c + 1 + m);
  memset(mini, INF, sizeof(mini));
  mini[0] = 0;
  for (int i = 1; i <= m; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j <= n - c[i]; j++) {
      if (mini[j] + 1 < mini[j + c[i]]) {
        mini[j + c[i]] = mini[j] + 1;
      }
    }
  }
  cout << mini[n] << endl;
  return 0;
}
```
