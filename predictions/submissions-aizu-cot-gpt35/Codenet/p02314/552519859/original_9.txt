The given program calculates the minimum number of coins needed to make a sum of 'n' using a given set of 'm' coins. The program uses a dynamic programming approach to solve the problem.

To optimize the program, we can make a few modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary headers: The program includes unnecessary headers such as <cstdio> and <math.h> which are not used in the program. We can remove these headers to improve compilation time and reduce memory usage.

2. Use 'std::vector' instead of arrays: Instead of using fixed-size arrays for 'c' and 'mini', we can use 'std::vector' to dynamically allocate memory. This will allow us to handle larger input sizes and reduce memory allocation overhead.

3. Use 'std::cin' and 'std::cout' for I/O: Instead of using 'scanf' and 'printf' for input and output, we can use 'std::cin' and 'std::cout' which provide a more convenient and safer way of handling I/O.

4. Optimize the sorting algorithm: The program uses 'std::sort' to sort the 'c' array. However, we can use a more efficient sorting algorithm such as 'std::sort' with a custom comparator to sort the array in non-decreasing order.

5. Optimize the inner loop: The inner loop performs unnecessary iterations by starting from 0 instead of starting from the current coin value. We can modify the loop to start from 'c[i]' instead of 0 to reduce unnecessary iterations.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

const int INF = 2000000000;

int main() {
  int n, m;
  std::cin >> n >> m;
  
  std::vector<int> c(m);
  for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
    std::cin >> c[i];
  }
  
  std::sort(c.begin(), c.end());
  
  std::vector<int> mini(n + 1, INF);
  mini[0] = 0;
  
  for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
    for (int j = c[i]; j <= n; j++) {
      mini[j] = std::min(mini[j], mini[j - c[i]] + 1);
    }
  }
  
  std::cout << mini[n] << std::endl;
  
  return 0;
}
```

The optimized program maintains the same functionality as the original program but improves the running time and memory usage.
