Step 1: Remove unnecessary includes
The program includes the `<cstdio>` and `<math.h>` libraries, but does not actually use any functions from these libraries. Therefore, we can remove these includes to reduce unnecessary overhead.

Step 2: Optimize the sort
The program sorts the array `c` using the `std::sort` function. However, we can optimize this by using a more efficient sorting algorithm. Since the array has a fixed size of 21, we can use a simple selection sort which has a time complexity of O(n^2) but performs better for small arrays.

Step 3: Optimize the mini array initialization
The program initializes the `mini` array with a large value of `INF` using a for loop. However, we can optimize this by using the `memset` function from the `<cstring>` library to set all elements of the array to `INF` in a more efficient way.

Step 4: Optimize the inner loop
The inner loop of the program updates the `mini` array by calculating the minimum value for each element. However, we can optimize this by using a more efficient approach. Instead of iterating through all possible values of `j`, we can start the loop from `c[i]` instead of `0`. This is because for values of `j` less than `c[i]`, the minimum value for `mini[j + c[i]]` will always be `INF`. This optimization reduces the number of iterations and improves the overall performance.

Optimized Program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cstring>
using namespace std;

const int INF = 2000000000;

int main() {
  int n, m;
  cin >> n >> m;

  int c[21];
  int mini[50001];
  memset(mini, INF, sizeof(mini));

  for (int i = 1; i <= m; i++) {
    cin >> c[i];
  }

  // Selection Sort
  for (int i = 1; i <= m; i++) {
    int minIndex = i;
    for (int j = i + 1; j <= m; j++) {
      if (c[j] < c[minIndex]) {
        minIndex = j;
      }
    }
    swap(c[i], c[minIndex]);
  }

  for (int i = 1; i <= m; i++) {
    for (int j = c[i]; j <= n; j++) {
      mini[j] = min(mini[j], mini[j - c[i]] + 1);
    }
  }

  cout << mini[n] << endl;

  return 0;
}
```
