Step 1: Remove unnecessary headers
The program includes several headers that are not used in the code. We can remove these headers to reduce compilation time and improve memory usage.

The unnecessary headers are:
- <algorithm>
- <cfloat>
- <climits>
- <cmath>
- <complex>
- <cstdio>
- <cstdlib>
- <cstring>
- <ctime>
- <functional>
- <list>
- <map>
- <memory>
- <numeric>
- <queue>
- <set>
- <sstream>
- <stack>
- <string>
- <utility>
- <vector>

Step 2: Optimize the dpru function
The dpru function is the main computational function in the program. Currently, it uses a 2D array to store the dynamic programming table. However, since the dimensions of the table are fixed at 333, we can replace the 2D array with a 1D array of size 333. This will reduce the memory usage and improve cache locality.

Step 3: Optimize the input reading
Currently, the program reads the input using the getline and cin functions. However, we can optimize the input reading by using the scanf function instead. This will be faster and more efficient.

Step 4: Remove unnecessary typedefs
The program defines several typedefs that are not used in the code. We can remove these typedefs to simplify the code and improve readability.

Optimized code:

```cpp
#include <cstdio>
#include <cstring>
using namespace std;

#define CLEAR(arr, val) memset(arr, val, sizeof(arr))
#define rep(i, n) for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)

int n, m;

int dpru(int *c, int *v) {
  int dp[333];
  CLEAR(dp, 0);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    for (int j = 0; j <= m; ++j) {
      dp[j] = max(dp[j], (j >= c[i] ? dp[j - c[i]] + v[i] : 0));
    }
  }
  return dp[m];
}

int main() {
  while (scanf("%d %d", &n, &m) == 2) {
    int c[333], v[3][333];
    rep(i, n) {
      scanf("%d", &c[i]);
      rep(j, 3) scanf("%d", &v[j][i]);
    }
    int res = 0;
    rep(i, 3) res = max(res, dpru(c, v[i]));
    printf("%d\n", res);
  }
}
```
