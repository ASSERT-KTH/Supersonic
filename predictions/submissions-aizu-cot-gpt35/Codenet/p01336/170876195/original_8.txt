The program provided can be optimized in the following steps:

1. Remove unnecessary header files: The program includes several header files that are not used. We can remove them to improve compilation time and reduce memory usage.

2. Remove unnecessary macros: The program defines several macros that are not used. We can remove them to simplify the code.

3. Remove unnecessary libraries: The program includes several libraries that are not used. We can remove them to improve compilation time and reduce memory usage.

4. Optimize the `dpru` function: The `dpru` function uses a 2-dimensional array `dp` to store intermediate results. However, we only need to keep track of the previous row and the current row. We can optimize the function by using two 1-dimensional arrays instead of a 2-dimensional array. This will reduce memory usage.

5. Optimize the input reading: The program currently reads the input using `getline` and `cin >>`. This can be simplified by using `cin` and `getline` consistently.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cstring>
using namespace std;

#define rep(i, n) for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)

int n, m;

int dpru(int *c, int *v) {
  int dp[333];
  memset(dp, 0, sizeof(dp));
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    for (int j = m; j >= c[i]; --j) {
      dp[j] = max(dp[j], dp[j - c[i]] + v[i]);
    }
  }
  return dp[m];
}

int main() {
  while (cin >> n >> m) {
    int c[333], v[3][333];
    rep(i, n) {
      int t;
      cin >> c[i];
      rep(j, 3) cin >> v[j][i];
    }
    int res = 0;
    rep(i, 3) res = max(res, dpru(c, v[i]));
    cout << res << endl;
  }
}
```

This optimized program should have improved running time and reduced memory usage compared to the original program.
