The given program is a dynamic programming solution for a problem involving idols and their attributes. The optimization can be done in the following steps:

1. Remove unnecessary headers: The program includes many unnecessary headers that are not used in the code. These headers can be removed to reduce memory usage and improve compilation time.

2. Remove unnecessary typedefs: The program includes typedefs for `ll`, `P`, and `PP`, but these types are not used in the code. These typedefs can be removed to simplify the code.

3. Replace `vector<Data>` with `Data[]`: The program currently uses a vector to store the idols, but the size of the vector is fixed based on the input. Instead of using a vector, we can use a fixed-size array `Data[]` to store the idols. This change will reduce memory usage and improve runtime performance.

4. Optimize the inner loop: The innermost loop in the program iterates from 0 to 300, but it can be optimized to iterate only until `M / idols[j].mC`. This change will reduce the number of iterations and improve runtime performance.

5. Remove unnecessary check in the inner loop: The inner loop checks if `i - idols[j].mC * k < 0` before updating `dp[i][0]`, `dp[i][1]`, and `dp[i][2]`. However, this check is unnecessary because the loop only iterates until `M / idols[j].mC`, which means `i - idols[j].mC * k` will never be negative. Removing this check will simplify the code and improve runtime performance.

6. Replace `printf` with `cout`: The program currently uses `printf` to output the result. We can replace it with `cout` for consistency with the use of `cin` for input. This change will simplify the code.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cstring>
#include <sstream>
using namespace std;

#define INF 0x3f3f3f3f

static const double EPS = 1e-8;

class Data {
public:
  string mName;
  int mC, mV, mD, mL;
  Data(string _n, int _c, int _v, int _d, int _l) {
    mName = _n;
    mC = _c;
    mV = _v;
    mD = _d;
    mL = _l;
  }
};

int dp[301][3];

int main() {
  int N, M;
  string line;
  stringstream ss;
  while (getline(cin, line)) {
    ss << line;
    ss >> N >> M;
    ss.clear();
    Data idols[300];
    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
      getline(cin, line);
      string name = line;
      getline(cin, line);
      ss << line;
      int C, V, D, L;
      ss >> C >> V >> D >> L;
      ss.clear();
      idols[i] = Data(name, C, V, D, L);
    }
    memset(dp, 0, sizeof(dp));
    for (int i = 0; i <= M; i++) {
      for (int j = 0; j < N; j++) {
        for (int k = 0; k <= M / idols[j].mC; k++) {
          dp[i][0] = max(dp[i - idols[j].mC * k][0] + idols[j].mV * k, dp[i][0]);
          dp[i][1] = max(dp[i - idols[j].mC * k][1] + idols[j].mD * k, dp[i][1]);
          dp[i][2] = max(dp[i - idols[j].mC * k][2] + idols[j].mL * k, dp[i][2]);
        }
      }
    }
    int maxv = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i <= M; i++) {
      for (int j = 0; j < 3; j++) {
        maxv = max(dp[i][j], maxv);
      }
    }
    cout << maxv << endl;
  }
}
