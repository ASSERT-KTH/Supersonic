The given C++ program reads a sequence of integers, calculates the cumulative sum of the sequence, and then finds the maximum sum of any subsequence of length k. The program uses a vector to store the cumulative sum and a loop to find the maximum sum.

To optimize this program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The program includes several unnecessary headers, such as `<algorithm>`, `<climits>`, `<cstring>`, `<map>`, and `<string>`. Since these headers are not used in the program, we can remove them to reduce compilation time and memory usage.

2. Use `reserve` instead of `resize` for the vector: The program initializes the vector `ac` with `n + 1` elements and then assigns values to the elements using a loop. Instead of using `resize`, which initializes the elements to zero, we can use `reserve` to allocate memory for the elements without initializing them. This can improve the program's memory usage.

3. Use `max_element` instead of a loop to find the maximum sum: Instead of using a loop to find the maximum sum, we can use the `max_element` function from the `<algorithm>` header to find the maximum element in a range. We can pass the range `ac.begin() + k` to `ac.end()` to find the maximum sum of any subsequence of length k. This can simplify the code and potentially improve the program's running time.

Here is the optimized C++ program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int n, k;
  while (cin >> n >> k, n) {
    vector<long long> ac;
    ac.reserve(n + 1);
    for (int i = 0; i <= n; ++i) {
      long long x;
      cin >> x;
      if (i > 0) {
        x += ac[i - 1];
      }
      ac.push_back(x);
    }
    auto it = max_element(ac.begin() + k, ac.end());
    cout << *it - ac[it - ac.begin() - k] << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Explanation of the optimization steps:

1. Removed unnecessary includes: The unnecessary includes were removed to avoid unnecessary memory usage and reduce compilation time.

2. Used `reserve` instead of `resize` for the vector: The `ac` vector is now initialized with `reserve` to allocate memory for the elements without initializing them to zero. This reduces the program's memory usage.

3. Used `max_element` instead of a loop to find the maximum sum: The loop to find the maximum sum was replaced with the `max_element` function to simplify the code and potentially improve the program's running time. The function finds the maximum element in the range `ac.begin() + k` to `ac.end()`, which corresponds to the maximum sum of any subsequence of length k.
