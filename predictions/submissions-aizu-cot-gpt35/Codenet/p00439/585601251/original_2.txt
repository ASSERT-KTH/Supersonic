Step 1: Remove unnecessary headers

The program includes several unnecessary headers that are not used in the code. We can remove them to improve compile time and reduce memory usage.

Step 2: Remove unused variables

The variables `map` and `val` are declared but not used in the code. We can safely remove them.

Step 3: Optimize the vector initialization

The vector `ac` is initialized with size `n+1` and all elements set to 0. However, we can optimize this by using the `vector::resize` method instead of the constructor. This avoids unnecessary memory allocation and initialization.

Step 4: Optimize the loop

The loop that calculates the cumulative sums in the `ac` vector can be optimized. Instead of using the index `i` to access elements in `ac`, we can use a reference to the current element. This avoids accessing the vector using an index, which can be slower.

Step 5: Optimize the calculation of `res`

The calculation of `res` can be optimized by using a temporary variable to store the difference between `ac[i]` and `ac[i-k]`. This avoids accessing `ac` twice for each iteration of the loop.

Step 6: Remove unnecessary `using` directive

The `using namespace std;` directive is unnecessary in this code, as there are no references to any names in the `std` namespace. We can remove it for clarity.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

int main() {
  int n, k;
  while (std::cin >> n >> k, n) {
    std::vector<long long> ac;
    ac.reserve(n + 1);
    ac.resize(n + 1, 0);
    
    for (auto& elem : ac) {
      std::cin >> elem;
      elem += (elem - k >= 0) ? ac[elem - k] : 0;
    }

    long long res = -std::numeric_limits<long long>::max();
    for (int i = k; i <= n; ++i) {
      long long diff = ac[i] - ac[i - k];
      res = std::max(res, diff);
    }

    std::cout << res << std::endl;
  }
  
  return 0;
}
```
