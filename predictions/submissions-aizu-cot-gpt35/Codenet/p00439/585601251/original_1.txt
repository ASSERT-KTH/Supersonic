Step 1: Remove unnecessary includes

The program includes some unnecessary headers that are not used. We can remove them to improve compile time and reduce memory usage.

Step 2: Remove unnecessary namespace

The program is using the "using namespace std" directive, which brings all the names from the std namespace into the global namespace. This can cause potential naming conflicts and increase the compilation time. We can remove this directive and use the std:: prefix when calling functions or using types from the std namespace.

Step 3: Optimize input/output operations

The program currently uses the "cin" and "cout" objects for input and output. These objects are synchronized with the standard C I/O streams, which can be slower compared to using the C I/O functions directly. We can use the "scanf" and "printf" functions from the C library to optimize the input/output operations.

Step 4: Optimize the loop initialization

The program initializes the "ac" vector with default values of 0. Instead of doing this, we can directly initialize the "ac" vector with the input values. This will eliminate the need for the inner loop that reads the input values and adds them to the accumulative vector.

Step 5: Optimize the maximum calculation

The program currently uses the "max" function to calculate the maximum value. We can optimize this by using a simple if statement to update the maximum value directly. This will save some function call overhead.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <cstdio>
#include <climits>
#include <vector>

int main() {
  int n, k;
  while (scanf("%d %d", &n, &k), n) {
    std::vector<long long> ac(n + 1);
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
      scanf("%lld", &ac[i]);
      ac[i] += ac[i - 1];
    }
    long long res = -LLONG_MAX;
    for (int i = k; i <= n; ++i) {
      if (ac[i] - ac[i - k] > res) {
        res = ac[i] - ac[i - k];
      }
    }
    printf("%lld\n", res);
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Explanation of optimizations:

- Removed unnecessary includes: The algorithm header was not used, so it was removed. The string and map headers were also not used in the provided code, so they were removed as well. The cstring header was not needed because the program did not use any of its functions, so it was removed.

- Removed unnecessary namespace: The "using namespace std" directive was removed to avoid potential naming conflicts and improve compilation time.

- Optimized input/output operations: The program now uses the scanf function for input and the printf function for output. These functions are generally faster than their C++ counterparts cin and cout.

- Optimized the loop initialization: The ac vector is now directly initialized with input values, eliminating the need for an inner loop to read and accumulate the values.

- Optimized the maximum calculation: The program now uses a simple if statement to update the maximum value directly, instead of using the max function. This eliminates the function call overhead and simplifies the code.
