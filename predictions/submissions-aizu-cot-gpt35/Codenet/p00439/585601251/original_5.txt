The given program is already quite efficient, but there are a few optimizations that can be made:

1. Remove unnecessary headers: The program includes several headers that are not used, such as `<algorithm>`, `<cstring>`, `<map>`, and `<string>`. We can remove these to improve compilation time and reduce memory usage.

2. Remove `using namespace std;`: Using the entire `std` namespace is considered bad practice as it can lead to naming conflicts. Instead, we can specify the namespace for each used identifier.

3. Use a more efficient data type for `res`: The variable `res` is initialized with the minimum value of a `long long`, which is unnecessary. We can initialize it to `LLONG_MIN` instead. Additionally, we can use an `int` instead of a `long long` for `res` since the problem statement does not mention the need for a large number range.

4. Use a more efficient loop for calculating `ac`: The loop that calculates the prefix sum `ac` can be optimized to avoid unnecessary addition operations. Instead of adding `ac[i]` to `ac[i - 1]`, we can directly assign `ac[i]` to the sum of `ac[i]` and `ac[i - 1]`.

5. Use a more efficient loop for calculating `res`: The loop that calculates the maximum sum can be optimized by avoiding repeated subtraction operations. Instead of subtracting `ac[i - k]` from `ac[i]` in every iteration, we can subtract `ac[i - k - 1]` from `ac[i - 1]` only once and then add `ac[i]` to the result.

Here is the optimized program incorporating these optimizations:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <climits>

int main() {
  int n, k;
  while (std::cin >> n >> k, n) {
    std::vector<int> ac(n + 1, 0);
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
      std::cin >> ac[i];
      ac[i] += ac[i - 1];
    }
    int res = INT_MIN;
    for (int i = k; i <= n; ++i) {
      int currentSum = ac[i] - ac[i - k - 1];
      res = std::max(res, currentSum);
    }
    std::cout << res << std::endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```
