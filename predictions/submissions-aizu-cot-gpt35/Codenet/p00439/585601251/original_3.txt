Step 1: Avoid unnecessary includes

The program includes several unnecessary headers that are not used. We can remove them to reduce memory usage.

Step 2: Avoid using "using namespace std;"

Using the entire std namespace can lead to naming conflicts and increase the compilation time. We can remove "using namespace std;" and use the "std::" prefix for the required standard library functions.

Step 3: Optimize the loop iteration

The loop iteration can be optimized to avoid unnecessary computations. Instead of iterating from 1 to n, we can start the iteration from k. This will reduce the number of iterations and improve the running time.

Step 4: Remove the unnecessary check for n in the while loop

Since the condition "n" is checked in the while loop, we don't need to check it again inside the loop. We can remove the "if (n)" check inside the loop.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <climits>

int main() {
  int n, k;
  while (std::cin >> n >> k, n) {
    std::vector<long long> ac(n + 1, 0);
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
      std::cin >> ac[i];
      ac[i] += ac[i - 1];
    }
    long long res = -LLONG_MAX;
    for (int i = k; i <= n; ++i) {
      res = std::max(res, ac[i] - ac[i - k]);
    }
    std::cout << res << std::endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```
The optimized program removes unnecessary includes, avoids using "using namespace std;", optimizes the loop iteration, and removes the unnecessary check for n in the while loop.
