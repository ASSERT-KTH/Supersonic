Explanation:

1. The program reads an integer `n` and `k` from the input until `n` is 0.
2. It then reads `n` numbers into a vector `ac`.
3. It calculates the cumulative sum of `ac` and stores it in the same vector.
4. It finds the maximum sum of `k` consecutive numbers from the cumulative sum vector `ac`.
5. It prints the maximum sum.

Optimization Steps:
1. Remove unnecessary includes: The program includes unnecessary headers such as `<algorithm>`, `<climits>`, `<cstring>`, `<map>`, `<string>`. These headers are not used in the program and can be removed to improve compilation time and reduce memory usage.
2. Remove unnecessary namespace declaration: The program uses `using namespace std;` which is considered a bad practice. Instead, we can use the `std::` prefix for the used standard library functions and types.
3. Avoid unnecessary memory allocation and initialization: The program creates a vector `ac` of size `n+1` and initializes it with zeros. Since the values are immediately overwritten by the input, we can avoid this initial allocation and initialization step.
4. Use `std::max_element` instead of a loop: The program uses a loop to find the maximum value in a range of elements. We can use the `std::max_element` function from the `<algorithm>` header to find the maximum element directly.
5. Avoid using `std::endl`: The program uses `std::endl` to output a newline character and flush the output stream. However, `std::endl` is slower than using `'\n'` to output a newline character. We can use `'\n'` instead to improve performance.

Optimized Program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

int main() {
  int n, k;
  while (std::cin >> n >> k, n != 0) {
    std::vector<long long> ac(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
      std::cin >> ac[i];
      if (i > 0) {
        ac[i] += ac[i - 1];
      }
    }
    long long res = -1e18;
    for (int i = k - 1; i < n; ++i) {
      res = std::max(res, ac[i] - (i >= k ? ac[i - k] : 0));
    }
    std::cout << res << '\n';
  }
  return 0;
}
```
