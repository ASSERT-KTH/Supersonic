This program calculates the maximum sum of k consecutive numbers in an array of n numbers. 

Here is the step-by-step explanation of the optimization:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The program includes several unnecessary header files like `<algorithm>`, `<cstring>`, `<map>`, `<string>`. Since these are not used in the program, we can safely remove them.

2. Remove the `using namespace std` line: It is generally not good practice to use the entire `std` namespace. Instead, we can prefix the required standard library functions and types with `std::`.

3. Avoid unnecessary variable initialization: In the original program, the vector `ac` is initialized with zeros using `vector<long long> ac(n + 1, 0)`. However, this initialization is not necessary because we will immediately overwrite the values in the loop. We can simply declare `vector<long long> ac(n + 1)`.

4. Use `reserve` for vector capacity: Since the size of the vector `ac` is known in advance, we can use `ac.reserve(n + 1)` to pre-allocate memory for the vector instead of dynamically resizing it during the loop.

5. Use prefix increment: In the loop `for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i)`, we can use prefix increment (`++i`) instead of postfix increment (`i++`) because we don't need the value of `i` after the increment.

6. Remove unnecessary `#include <iostream>`: The program does not actually use any input or output functionality from `<iostream>`. We can safely remove it.

Here is the optimized program:

```c++
#include <climits>
#include <vector>

int main() {
  int n, k;
  while (std::cin >> n >> k, n) {
    std::vector<long long> ac;
    ac.reserve(n + 1);
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
      long long num;
      std::cin >> num;
      ac.push_back(ac.back() + num);
    }
    long long res = -LLONG_MAX;
    for (int i = k; i <= n; ++i) {
      res = std::max(res, ac[i] - ac[i - k]);
    }
    std::cout << res << std::endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```
