Step 1: Remove unnecessary includes
The program includes the entire "bits/stdc++.h" library, which is not necessary for this program. We can remove this line to improve compile time and reduce memory usage.

Step 2: Remove unnecessary typedefs
The program typedefs "LL", "PII", and "flt", but these types are not used in the program. We can remove these typedefs to simplify the code.

Step 3: Optimize the calculation loop
The program currently uses a loop to calculate the cost for each item. However, we can optimize this loop by calculating the minimum value for "f" (the number of items needed) and then calculating the cost using this minimum value. This will reduce the number of iterations in the loop.

Step 4: Optimize the search loop
The program uses a loop to search for the minimum cost by dividing the search range into three parts. However, we can optimize this loop by using a binary search instead. This will reduce the number of iterations and improve the running time.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <cstdio>
#include <climits>

const int MAXN = 100000 + 10;
const double EPS = 1e-7;

int vw[MAXN], pf[MAXN], vf[MAXN], th[MAXN];
int N, pw;

double calc(double W) {
  double cost = W * pw;
  double minF = INT_MAX;
  for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
    double need = th[i] - W * vw[i];
    if (need > 0) {
      double f = need / vf[i];
      if (f < minF) {
        minF = f;
      }
    }
  }
  cost += minF * pf[0];
  return cost;
}

int main() {
  while (scanf("%d", &N) == 1 && N) {
    scanf("%d", &pw);
    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
      scanf("%d%d%d%d", vw + i, pf + i, vf + i, th + i);
    }
    double left = 0, right = INT_MAX;
    double result = 0;
    while (right - left > EPS) {
      double mid = (left + right) / 2.0;
      double c1 = calc(mid);
      double c2 = calc(mid + EPS);
      if (c1 < c2) {
        right = mid;
        result = c1;
      } else {
        left = mid;
        result = c2;
      }
    }
    printf("%.10f\n", result);
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Explanation of optimization steps:

Step 1: Removed unnecessary includes.
   - Removed the line "#include <bits/stdc++.h>"

Step 2: Removed unnecessary typedefs.
   - Removed the typedefs for "LL", "PII", and "flt".

Step 3: Optimized the calculation loop.
   - Changed the loop to calculate the minimum value for "f" (the number of items needed) and then calculate the cost using this minimum value.
   - This reduces the number of iterations in the loop and improves performance.

Step 4: Optimized the search loop.
   - Replaced the loop that divides the search range into three parts with a binary search.
   - This reduces the number of iterations and improves the running time.
