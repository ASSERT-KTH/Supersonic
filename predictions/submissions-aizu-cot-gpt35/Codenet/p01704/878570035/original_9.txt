The main bottleneck of the given program is the calculation of the `calc` function inside the main loop. This function is called for every iteration of the loop, and it involves multiple divisions and floating point operations. 

To optimize the program, we can pre-compute some values outside the loop and store them in variables. This will eliminate unnecessary computations and improve the overall performance of the program.

Here are the steps to optimize the program:

1. Remove the unnecessary includes. The `bits/stdc++.h` header includes a large number of standard library headers, which can slow down the compilation process. Instead, only include the necessary headers.

2. Remove the unnecessary type definitions. The `typedef` statements for `LL` and `PII` are not used in the program. Removing them will make the code cleaner.

3. Move the calculation of `left` and `right` outside the loop. Since these values remain constant throughout the loop, we can calculate them once before entering the loop and store them in variables.

4. Pre-compute the values of `W * vw[i]` and `vf[i]` outside the loop. These values are used in the calculation of `need` and `f` inside the loop. By calculating them once before entering the loop and storing them in arrays, we can avoid redundant calculations in each iteration.

5. Replace the division operations inside the loop with multiplication by the reciprocal. Division operations are generally slower than multiplication operations. We can calculate the reciprocal of `vf[i]` outside the loop and store it in an array. Then, inside the loop, we can multiply `need` and `f` by the reciprocal instead of dividing by `vf[i]`.

6. Replace the `scanf` function calls with faster input methods. The use of `scanf` for input can be slow, especially when reading large input datasets. Instead, we can use faster input methods such as `cin` or `getline` to improve the input performance.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <limits>
using namespace std;

const int MAXN = 100000 + 10;
const double eps = 1e-7;
int vw[MAXN], pf[MAXN], vf[MAXN], th[MAXN];
int N, pw;
double calc(double W, const double* reciprocals) {
  double cost = W * pw;
  for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
    double need = th[i] - W * vw[i];
    if (need <= 0)
      continue;
    double f = need * reciprocals[i];
    cost += f * pf[i];
  }
  return cost;
}

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  
  while (cin >> N && N) {
    cin >> pw;
    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
      cin >> vw[i] >> pf[i] >> vf[i] >> th[i];
    }
    double left = 0, right = numeric_limits<double>::max();
    double reciprocals[MAXN];
    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
      reciprocals[i] = 1.0 / vf[i];
    }
    for (int _ = 0; _ < 200; ++_) {
      double m1 = (left + left + right) / 3.0;
      double m2 = (left + right + right) / 3.0;
      double c1 = calc(m1, reciprocals);
      double c2 = calc(m2, reciprocals);
      if (c1 < c2)
        right = m2;
      else
        left = m1;
    }
    cout.precision(10);
    cout << fixed << calc(left, reciprocals) << endl;
  }
  
  return 0;
}
```

By applying these optimizations, the program should run faster and use less memory compared to the original version.
