The given code calculates the minimum cost for a given set of parameters. The main optimization that can be done in this code is to improve the precision of the calculations.

Currently, the code uses `double` data type for floating point calculations. However, using `double` can introduce errors due to limited precision. We can improve the precision by using `long double` instead.

Another optimization that can be done is to remove the unnecessary inclusion of the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header file. This header file includes a large number of other header files, which can slow down the compilation process and increase memory usage.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cstdio>
#include <cstring>
#include <algorithm>
#include <cmath>

using namespace std;

typedef long long LL;
typedef pair<int, int> PII;
typedef long double flt;

const int MAXN = 100000 + 10;
const flt eps = 1e-9;

int vw[MAXN], pf[MAXN], vf[MAXN], th[MAXN];
int N, pw;

flt calc(flt W) {
  flt cost = W * pw;
  for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
    flt need = th[i] - W * vw[i];
    if (need <= 0)
      continue;
    flt f = need / vf[i];
    cost += f * pf[i];
  }
  return cost;
}

int main() {
  while (scanf("%d", &N) == 1 && N) {
    scanf("%d", &pw);
    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
      scanf("%d%d%d%d", vw + i, pf + i, vf + i, th + i);
    }
    flt left = 0, right = INT_MAX;
    for (int _ = 0; _ < 200; ++_) {
      flt m1 = (left + left + right) / 3.0;
      flt m2 = (left + right + right) / 3.0;
      flt c1 = calc(m1), c2 = calc(m2);
      if (c1 < c2)
        right = m2;
      else
        left = m1;
    }
    printf("%.10Lf\n", calc(left));
  }
  return 0;
}
```

In the optimized code, we have replaced `double` with `long double` for improved precision. We have also removed the unnecessary inclusion of the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header file and replaced it with the necessary standard headers.
