Explanation of Optimization Steps:

1. Remove unnecessary headers: The program includes `<bits/stdc++.h>` which includes a lot of unnecessary headers. We can remove this line and include only the required headers.

2. Remove unnecessary typedefs: The program defines typedefs for `LL` and `PII` which are not used. We can remove these typedefs.

3. Use `double` instead of `flt`: The program uses `flt` as a typedef for `double`. We can directly use `double` instead of `flt` for better readability.

4. Use a more meaningful variable name: The variable `pw` is used to store the power value. We can rename it to `power` for better understanding.

5. Optimize the `calc` function: In the `calc` function, we can calculate the `need` value only once and store it in a variable. This will avoid the repeated calculation of `need`. Additionally, we can use a temporary variable to store the result of the division `need / vf[i]` to avoid repeated calculation.

6. Use a more efficient loop condition: In the main loop, the condition `_ < 200` can be optimized by using a condition based on the difference between `left` and `right` values. We can use a condition like `fabs(right - left) > eps` where `eps` is a small value.

7. Optimize the calculation of `m1` and `m2`: Instead of using `(left + left + right) / 3.0` and `(left + right + right) / 3.0` to calculate `m1` and `m2`, we can use `left + (right - left) / 3.0` and `right - (right - left) / 3.0` respectively. This avoids unnecessary addition and multiplication operations.

8. Use a more efficient way to compare `c1` and `c2`: Instead of using an `if` condition to compare `c1` and `c2` and update `right` and `left` accordingly, we can use a ternary operator to achieve the same result in a more concise way.

9. Use a more efficient way to print the result: Instead of using `printf("%.10f\n", calc(left))` to print the result, we can use `cout` for better performance.

Optimized Program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

const int MAXN = 100000 + 10;
const double eps = 1e-7;

int vw[MAXN], pf[MAXN], vf[MAXN], th[MAXN];
int N, power;

double calc(double W) {
  double cost = W * power;
  for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
    double need = th[i] - W * vw[i];
    if (need <= 0)
      continue;
    double f = need / vf[i];
    cost += f * pf[i];
  }
  return cost;
}

int main() {
  while (scanf("%d", &N) == 1 && N) {
    scanf("%d", &power);
    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
      scanf("%d%d%d%d", vw + i, pf + i, vf + i, th + i);
    }
    double left = 0, right = INT_MAX;
    while (right - left > eps) {
      double m1 = left + (right - left) / 3.0;
      double m2 = right - (right - left) / 3.0;
      double c1 = calc(m1), c2 = calc(m2);
      right = (c1 < c2) ? m2 : right;
      left = (c1 < c2) ? left : m1;
    }
    cout << fixed;
    cout.precision(10);
    cout << calc(left) << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```
