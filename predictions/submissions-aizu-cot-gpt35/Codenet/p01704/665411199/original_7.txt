To optimize the given program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The program includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header, which is not a standard C/C++ header and includes a lot of unnecessary headers. We can remove this include and include only the necessary headers.

2. Remove unnecessary macros: The program defines the macros `MAX` and `inf`, but they are not used. We can remove these macros.

3. Use a more appropriate data type: The program uses `double` data type for variables `vw`, `pf`, `vf`, and `th`. However, these variables represent integer values. We can change the data type to `int` for these variables.

4. Optimize the `f` function: The `f` function calculates the cost based on some conditions. We can optimize this function by avoiding unnecessary calculations. Instead of calculating `sum1` and `sum2` separately, we can calculate `sum2` directly using the formula `(th[i] - W * vw[i]) / (double)vf[i]`. This eliminates the need for the `sum1` variable.

5. Use a more appropriate loop limit: In the main loop, the program runs for 200 iterations. We can optimize this loop by using a more appropriate loop limit. Instead of a fixed number of iterations, we can use a termination condition based on a tolerance level. We can define a tolerance level, such as 1e-9, and terminate the loop when the difference between `l` and `r` becomes less than or equal to the tolerance level.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cstdio>
using namespace std;

const int MAX = 100001;

int n, pw;
int vw[MAX], pf[MAX], vf[MAX], th[MAX];

double f(double W) {
  double cost = W * pw;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    if (W * vw[i] > th[i])
      continue;
    double sum2 = (th[i] - W * vw[i]) / (double)vf[i];
    cost += sum2 * pf[i];
  }
  return cost;
}

int main() {
  while (1) {
    cin >> n >> pw;
    if (n == 0)
      break;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
      cin >> vw[i] >> pf[i] >> vf[i] >> th[i];
    double l = 0, r = 1e9;
    double tolerance = 1e-9;
    while (r - l > tolerance) {
      double m1 = (l * 2.0 + r) / 3.0;
      double m2 = (l + r * 2.0) / 3.0;
      double res1 = f(m1);
      double res2 = f(m2);
      if (res1 < res2)
        r = m2;
      else
        l = m1;
    }
    printf("%.4f\n", f(l));
  }
  return 0;
}
```

These optimizations should improve the running time and memory usage of the program.
