The given program calculates the minimum cost required to produce a given quantity of a product by selecting different production plans. The program uses a ternary search algorithm to find the minimum cost.

To optimize the program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The program includes `<bits/stdc++.h>`, which is a non-standard header and includes a large number of other headers. We can remove this line and include the necessary specific headers instead.

2. Use `const` instead of `#define` for constants: Instead of using `#define` to define constants like `MAX` and `inf`, we can use `const` variables. This not only makes the code more readable but also allows the compiler to perform optimizations.

3. Use `std::cin` and `std::cout` instead of `cin` and `printf`: The program uses `cin` and `printf` for input and output. Using `std::cin` and `std::cout` from the `std` namespace is more idiomatic in C++, and it provides better type safety and performance.

4. Avoid unnecessary type conversions: The program uses `(double)vf[i]` to convert `vf[i]` to a `double` type. However, `vf` is already declared as `double`, so this conversion is unnecessary.

5. Use range-based `for` loop: Instead of using a traditional `for` loop with an index, we can use a range-based `for` loop to iterate over the elements of an array. This makes the code more concise and less error-prone.

6. Use `std::fixed` and `std::setprecision` for floating-point output: The program uses `printf` with the `%.4f` format specifier to output the result with 4 decimal places. In C++, we can use `std::fixed` and `std::setprecision` to achieve the same result.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <iomanip>
#include <vector>

const int MAX = 100001;
const double inf = 1e9;

double f(double W, const std::vector<double>& vw, const std::vector<double>& pf, const std::vector<double>& vf, const std::vector<double>& th, int n, int pw) {
  double cost = W * pw;
  for (double w : vw) {
    if (W * w > th[i])
      continue;
    double sum1 = th[i] - W * w;
    double sum2 = sum1 / vf[i];
    cost += sum2 * pf[i];
  }
  return cost;
}

int main() {
  while (true) {
    int n, pw;
    std::cin >> n >> pw;
    if (n == 0)
      break;
    std::vector<double> vw(n), pf(n), vf(n), th(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
      std::cin >> vw[i] >> pf[i] >> vf[i] >> th[i];
    double l = 0, r = inf;
    for (int i = 0; i < 200; i++) {
      double m1 = (l * 2.0 + r) / 3.0;
      double m2 = (l + r * 2.0) / 3.0;
      double res1 = f(m1, vw, pf, vf, th, n, pw);
      double res2 = f(m2, vw, pf, vf, th, n, pw);
      if (res1 < res2)
        r = m2;
      else
        l = m1;
    }
    std::cout << std::fixed << std::setprecision(4) << f(l, vw, pf, vf, th, n, pw) << std::endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized program reduces memory usage by using `std::vector` instead of arrays and improves code readability by using `const` variables and range-based `for` loops. It also uses `std::cout` and `std::cin` for input and output and `std::fixed` and `std::setprecision` for floating-point output.
