The given C/C++ program is a simple optimization problem that finds the minimum cost by adjusting a weight value. Here are the steps to optimize the program:

1. Remove unnecessary header file inclusion: The program includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header, which is not necessary. We can remove it.

2. Remove unnecessary macros: The program defines two macros, `MAX` and `inf`, but they are not used. We can remove them.

3. Use more efficient data types: The program uses `double` for most of the variables, but we can use `float` instead. This will reduce the memory usage.

4. Optimize the `f` function: In the `f` function, we can optimize the loop by calculating the values of `sum1` and `sum2` only once, instead of recalculating them in each iteration of the loop. This will reduce the number of floating-point operations.

5. Optimize the main loop: In the main loop, we can reduce the number of iterations from 200 to a smaller value. Since the loop uses a ternary search algorithm, reducing the number of iterations will still give us a good approximation of the minimum cost.

Here is the optimized C/C++ program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cstdio>
using namespace std;

const int MAX = 100001;
const float inf = 1e9;

int n, pw;
float vw[MAX], pf[MAX], vf[MAX], th[MAX];

float f(float W) {
  float cost = W * pw;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    if (W * vw[i] > th[i])
      continue;
    float sum1 = th[i] - W * vw[i];
    float sum2 = sum1 / vf[i];
    cost += sum2 * pf[i];
  }
  return cost;
}

int main() {
  while (1) {
    cin >> n >> pw;
    if (n == 0)
      break;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
      cin >> vw[i] >> pf[i] >> vf[i] >> th[i];
    float l = 0, r = inf;
    for (int i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
      float m1 = (l * 2.0 + r) / 3.0;
      float m2 = (l + r * 2.0) / 3.0;
      float res1 = f(m1);
      float res2 = f(m2);
      if (res1 < res2)
        r = m2;
      else
        l = m1;
    }
    printf("%.4f\n", f(l));
  }
  return 0;
}
```

In this optimized version of the program, we have made the following changes:

- Removed unnecessary header file inclusion.
- Removed unnecessary macros.
- Changed the data type from `double` to `float` for most variables.
- Optimized the `f` function to calculate `sum1` and `sum2` only once.
- Reduced the number of iterations in the main loop from 200 to 100.
