The given program calculates the minimum difference between the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle and a given value 'e'. The program iterates over all possible combinations of the lengths of the two sides of the triangle and calculates the difference between the hypotenuse and 'e'. It keeps track of the minimum difference found so far and prints it.

To optimize this program, we can make the following changes:

1. Remove unnecessary headers: The program includes unnecessary headers like `<map>`, `<string>`, and `<vector>`. Since these headers are not used in the program, we can remove them to improve compile time and reduce memory usage.

2. Remove unused variable 'e': The variable 'e' is not used anywhere in the program. We can remove it to improve memory usage.

3. Use 'const' for constants: The value '100000' is a constant that represents the initial value of 'min'. We can assign it to a 'const' variable to improve code readability.

4. Optimize the loop conditions: The outer loop iterates from 0 to 'd', and the inner loop iterates from 'i' to 'd'. However, we can optimize the loop conditions to reduce the number of unnecessary iterations. The outer loop can iterate from 0 to 'd - 1', and the inner loop can iterate from 'i' to 'd - i'. This optimization can significantly reduce the number of iterations and improve the running time.

5. Use 'pow' function instead of multiplication: Instead of calculating 'i * i' and 'j * j' using the multiplication operator, we can use the 'pow' function from the `<cmath>` header to improve code readability.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>

int main() {
  int d;
  while (1) {
    std::cin >> d;
    if (d == 0)
      break;
      
    const double initial_min = 100000;
    double min = initial_min;

    for (int i = 0; i < d; i++) {
      for (int j = i; j <= d - i; j++) {
        if (i + j == d) {
          double cost = std::sqrt(std::pow(i, 2) + std::pow(j, 2));
          double gap = std::abs(cost - d);
          if (gap < min) {
            min = gap;
          }
        }
      }
    }
    
    std::cout << min << std::endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized program removes unnecessary headers, variable, and makes small modifications to the loop conditions and calculations to improve the running time and reduce memory usage.
