Explanation of Optimization Steps:
1. Avoid unnecessary includes: The program includes unnecessary headers like `<map>`, `<string>`, and `<vector>`. Since these headers are not used in the program, we can remove them to reduce the compilation time and memory usage.
2. Avoid using `using namespace std`: The program uses `using namespace std` which brings all the names from the `std` namespace into the current scope. This can lead to potential naming conflicts. Instead, we can use the `std::` prefix for the required names from the `std` namespace.
3. Use more descriptive variable names: The variables `d` and `e` are not very descriptive. We can rename them to something more meaningful to improve code readability.
4. Use pre-calculated values: The program calculates the square root of `i * i + j * j` and `cost - e` multiple times in the nested loops. We can calculate these values once and store them in variables to avoid redundant calculations.
5. Use a more efficient loop condition: The outer loop condition `while (1)` is not very efficient. Instead of using an infinite loop, we can use a condition that checks for the termination condition of `d == 0 && e == 0`.
6. Use a more efficient algorithm: The current algorithm has a time complexity of O(d^2) because of the nested loops. We can optimize this by using a more efficient algorithm that reduces the number of iterations.

Optimized Program:
```
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>

int main() {
  int length, target;
  while (true) {
    std::cin >> length >> target;
    if (length == 0 && target == 0)
      break;

    double minGap = std::abs(length - target);
    for (int i = 0; i <= length; i++) {
      int j = length - i;
      double cost = std::sqrt(i * i + j * j);
      double gap = std::abs(cost - target);
      if (gap < minGap) {
        minGap = gap;
      }
    }

    std::cout << minGap << std::endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```
