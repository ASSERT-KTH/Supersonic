To optimize the given program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary include statements: The program includes the `<map>` and `<string>` headers, which are not used. We can remove these include statements to improve compile-time efficiency.

2. Avoid using `using namespace std;`: It is considered good practice to avoid using `using namespace std;` as it can lead to naming conflicts. Instead, we can prefix the standard library types and functions with `std::` to indicate their namespace.

3. Use `std::abs` instead of `sqrt` for absolute difference: Instead of using `sqrt((cost - e) * (cost - e))` to calculate the absolute difference between `cost` and `e`, we can use `std::abs(cost - e)`. This avoids unnecessary square root calculations and improves runtime efficiency.

4. Use `std::min` instead of manual comparison: Instead of manually comparing the `gap` with `min` and updating `min` if necessary, we can use `std::min` function to simplify the code and improve readability.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>
#include <vector>

int main() {
  int d, e;
  while (true) {
    std::cin >> d >> e;
    double min = 100000;
    if (d == 0 && e == 0)
      break;
    for (int i = 0; i <= d; i++) {
      for (int j = i; j <= d; j++) {
        if (i + j == d) {
          double cost = std::sqrt(i * i + j * j);
          double gap = std::abs(cost - e);
          min = std::min(min, gap);
        }
      }
    }
    std::cout << min << std::endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```

These modifications should improve the runtime efficiency and reduce unnecessary memory usage.
