Step 1: Eliminate unnecessary include statements
- The program includes the headers `<iostream>`, `<map>`, `<math.h>`, `<string>`, and `<vector>`, but none of them are actually used in the program. We can remove these unnecessary include statements to improve compilation time and reduce memory usage.

Step 2: Optimize the loops
- The program uses two nested loops to iterate over all possible values of `i` and `j`. However, we can optimize these loops to reduce the number of iterations by taking advantage of the condition `i + j == d`.
- Since `i` and `j` are both non-negative integers, the maximum value of `i` or `j` is `d/2`. Therefore, we can modify the loops to iterate from 0 to `d/2` instead of 0 to `d`.

Step 3: Optimize the calculation of `gap`
- The program calculates `gap` using the formula `gap = sqrt((cost - e) * (cost - e))`. However, we can simplify this calculation by using the absolute value function `abs()` instead.
- The simplified formula for `gap` is `gap = abs(cost - e)`.

Step 4: Use a more appropriate initial value for `min`
- The program initializes `min` to a very large value (`100000`). However, this is unnecessary. We can initialize `min` to a value that is guaranteed to be larger than any possible value of `gap`.
- Since `gap` is the square root of a sum of squares, it will always be non-negative. Therefore, we can initialize `min` to 0.

Step 5: Remove unnecessary variable declarations
- The program declares the variables `d`, `e`, and `min` outside the main loop, but they are only used within the loop. We can move the declarations inside the loop to improve code readability and reduce memory usage.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  while (1) {
    int d, e;
    cin >> d >> e;

    if (d == 0 && e == 0)
      break;

    double min = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i <= d/2; i++) {
      for (int j = i; j <= d/2; j++) {
        if (i + j == d) {
          double cost = sqrt(i * i + j * j);
          double gap = abs(cost - e);
          if (gap < min) {
            min = gap;
          }
        }
      }
    }

    cout << min << endl;
  }

  return 0;
}
```
