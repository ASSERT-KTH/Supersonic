The given program calculates the minimum gap between the hypotenuse of a right triangle and a given value 'e'. It does this by iterating over all possible combinations of 'i' and 'j' such that 'i + j' is equal to 'd', and calculating the cost and gap for each combination. The minimum gap is then stored in the variable 'min' and printed.

To optimize this program, we can make the following changes:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The program includes unnecessary libraries such as <map> and <string>. Since these libraries are not used in the program, we can remove them to improve compilation time and reduce memory usage.

2. Remove unnecessary 'using namespace std;': The 'using namespace std;' statement brings all names from the std namespace into the global namespace. This can cause naming conflicts and is generally considered bad practice. Instead, we can use the 'std::' prefix to explicitly specify the namespace for each name used from the std namespace.

3. Use 'pow' function for square calculation: Instead of using 'i * i' and 'j * j' to calculate the square of 'i' and 'j', we can use the 'pow' function from the <cmath> library. This can improve readability and potentially optimize the calculation.

4. Optimize the nested loops: Currently, the program uses two nested loops to iterate over all possible combinations of 'i' and 'j'. However, this can be optimized to reduce the number of iterations. Since 'i' and 'j' must sum up to 'd', we can modify the loop conditions to iterate only until 'j' reaches the value 'd - i'. This eliminates unnecessary iterations and improves the performance of the program.

5. Use 'std::numeric_limits' for 'min' initialization: Instead of initializing 'min' to a very large value (100000), we can use the 'std::numeric_limits<double>::max()' function to initialize 'min' to the maximum value of type 'double'. This ensures that any valid 'gap' value will be smaller than 'min' and eliminates the need for an arbitrary large value.

Here is the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>
#include <vector>

int main() {
  int d, e;
  while (true) {
    std::cin >> d >> e;
    double min = std::numeric_limits<double>::max();
    if (d == 0 && e == 0)
      break;
    for (int i = 0; i <= d; ++i) {
      for (int j = i; j <= d - i; ++j) {
        if (i + j == d) {
          double cost = std::sqrt(std::pow(i, 2) + std::pow(j, 2));
          double gap = std::abs(cost - e);
          if (gap < min) {
            min = gap;
          }
        }
      }
    }
    std::cout << min << std::endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized version of the program reduces unnecessary includes, removes the 'using namespace std;', uses the 'pow' function for square calculation, optimizes the nested loops, and initializes 'min' using 'std::numeric_limits<double>::max()'. These optimizations improve the performance and memory usage of the program.
