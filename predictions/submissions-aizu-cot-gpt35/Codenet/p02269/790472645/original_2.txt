Step 1: Remove unnecessary includes and macros.

The program includes the `<cstdio>` and `<iostream>` libraries, but they are not used in the code. Therefore, we can remove these includes.

The macros `REP`, `rep`, `MOD1`, and `MOD2` are defined but not used in the code. We can remove these macros as well.

Step 2: Remove unnecessary typedefs.

The typedefs `ll`, `ull`, and `ld` are defined but not used in the code. We can remove these typedefs.

Step 3: Remove unnecessary function.

The `pow` function is defined but not used in the code. We can remove this function.

Step 4: Optimize the `dic_op` function.

The `dic_op` function converts a string representation of a number in the base-5 system to an integer. Currently, it uses a loop to iterate through the characters of the string and perform calculations to compute the integer value. However, we can optimize this function by using the `atoi` function from the `<cstdlib>` library.

Step 5: Optimize the main loop.

Currently, the main loop reads input from the user and performs operations based on the input. However, the program stores all possible dictionary entries in a static character array of size 90000000. This is not efficient in terms of memory usage.

To optimize the main loop, we can use a `std::unordered_set` from the `<unordered_set>` library to store the dictionary entries. This data structure provides constant-time average complexity for insertion and lookup operations, which will improve the running time of the program.

Step 6: Optimize the `scanf` function.

The `scanf` function is used to read input in the main loop. However, `scanf` is generally slower than `cin` for reading input in C++. We can replace `scanf` with `cin` to improve the running time of the program.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_set>

int dic_op(const char* str) {
  return std::atoi(str);
}

int main() {
  int n;
  std::unordered_set<int> dic;
  char opstr[7];
  char str[13];
  std::cin >> n;
  
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    std::cin >> opstr >> str;
    
    if (opstr[0] == 'i') {
      dic.insert(dic_op(str));
    } else if (opstr[0] == 'f') {
      if (dic.find(dic_op(str)) != dic.end()) {
        std::cout << "yes" << std::endl;
      } else {
        std::cout << "no" << std::endl;
      }
    }
  }
  
  return 0;
}
```

Explanation:

- In the optimized program, unnecessary includes, macros, typedefs, and function (`pow`) are removed.
- The `dic_op` function is modified to use `std::atoi` for converting the string to an integer.
- The main loop uses a `std::unordered_set` to store the dictionary entries. The `insert` function is used to insert entries, and the `find` function is used to check if an entry exists in the set. `std::cout` is used for output instead of `puts` to improve running time.
