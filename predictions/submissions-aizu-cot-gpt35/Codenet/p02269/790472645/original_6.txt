The given program can be optimized in several ways:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The program includes `<cstdio>`, `<iostream>`, and `<cmath>`, but it only uses `cstdio` and `iostream`. Therefore, we can remove the `<cmath>` include.

2. Remove unnecessary macros: The program defines macros `REP`, `rep`, `MOD1`, and `MOD2`, but they are not used in the program. We can safely remove them.

3. Remove unnecessary typedefs: The program defines typedefs for `ll`, `ull`, and `ld`, but they are not used in the program. We can remove them.

4. Remove unnecessary pow() function: The program defines a custom `pow()` function, but it is not used in the program. We can remove it.

5. Optimize dictionary operation: The `dic_op()` function converts a string into a number using a specific mapping. However, this can be done more efficiently by using a hash function. We can create a hash map to store the strings as keys and their corresponding numbers as values. This way, we can perform the dictionary operation in constant time instead of linear time.

6. Optimize dictionary storage: The program declares a static character array `dic` with a very large size of 90000000. This consumes a lot of memory unnecessarily. We can use the hash map mentioned above to store the dictionary instead, which will use memory dynamically based on the actual number of elements in the dictionary.

7. Remove unnecessary variable `ans`: The variable `ans` is declared but not used in the program. We can remove it.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>
using namespace std;

int dic_op(const string& str) {
  int g = 0;
  for (char c : str) {
    g *= 5;
    if (c == 'A')
      g += 1;
    else if (c == 'C')
      g += 2;
    else if (c == 'G')
      g += 3;
    else if (c == 'T')
      g += 4;
    else
      break;
  }
  return g;
}

int main() {
  int n;
  unordered_map<int, int> dic;
  string opstr, str;
  cin >> n;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> opstr >> str;
    if (opstr == "i") {
      dic[dic_op(str)] = 1;
    } else if (opstr == "f") {
      if (dic.count(dic_op(str)) > 0)
        cout << "yes" << endl;
      else
        cout << "no" << endl;
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized program reduces memory usage by using a hash map for the dictionary and removes unnecessary code and variables.
