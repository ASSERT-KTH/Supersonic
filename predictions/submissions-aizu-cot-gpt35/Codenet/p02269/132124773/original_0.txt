Step 1: Reduce I/O Operations
In the given program, there are multiple input and output operations inside the loop, which can be optimized to reduce the number of I/O operations. Instead of printing "yes" or "no" for each query, we can store the results in a vector and print them all at once after the loop ends.

Step 2: Use a more efficient data structure
The current program uses a map to store the dictionary. Since we only need to check if a word exists or not, a set would be a more efficient data structure. This is because a set has a faster lookup time compared to a map.

Step 3: Remove unnecessary 'using namespace std'
Using the entire std namespace is generally considered bad practice. We can remove this line and specify the namespace for specific items where needed.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <set>
#include <string>
#include <vector>

int main() {
  int n;
  std::cin >> n;
  
  std::set<std::string> dictionary;
  std::vector<std::string> results;
  
  std::string com, word;
  while (n--) {
    std::cin >> com >> word;
    if (com[0] == 'i')
      dictionary.insert(word);
    else {
      if (dictionary.count(word))
        results.push_back("yes");
      else
        results.push_back("no");
    }
  }
  
  for (const auto& result : results) {
    std::cout << result << std::endl;
  }
  
  return 0;
}
```

Explanation:
1. We replaced the `map<string, bool>` with `set<string>`. This change improves the lookup time as sets are optimized for membership checking.
2. We added a `vector<string>` called `results` to store the results of the queries. Instead of printing the results immediately, we store them in the vector and print them all at once after the loop ends. This reduces the number of I/O operations.
3. We removed the line `using namespace std` and added `std::` prefix to the standard library items where needed. This is a good practice to avoid naming conflicts and make the code more readable.
