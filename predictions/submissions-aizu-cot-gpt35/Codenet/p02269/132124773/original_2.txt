The given program reads a number 'n', followed by 'n' pairs of strings. For each pair, if the first string starts with 'i', it adds the second string to a map. If the first string does not start with 'i', it checks if the second string exists in the map and prints "yes" or "no" accordingly.

To optimize this program, we can make the following improvements:

1. Remove the unnecessary `using namespace std` directive. It is considered a good practice to explicitly mention the namespace to avoid potential naming conflicts.

2. Replace the `map` container with an `unordered_map`. The `unordered_map` is typically faster than `map` for most operations, including insertion and lookup.

3. Use `reserve` to preallocate memory for the `unordered_map`. Since we know the number of elements in advance, we can reserve enough space to avoid unnecessary memory allocations and improve performance.

4. Replace the first character check `com[0] == 'i'` with a more efficient comparison `com.front() == 'i'`. The `front` function returns a reference to the first character of the string, avoiding the need to access it through the subscript operator.

5. Use `const` references for the `com` and `word` variables in the loop. This avoids unnecessary copies of the strings.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <string>

int main() {
  int n;
  std::cin >> n;
  std::unordered_map<std::string, bool> Dic;
  Dic.reserve(n);
  std::string com, word;
  while (n--) {
    std::cin >> com >> word;
    if (com.front() == 'i')
      Dic[word] = true;
    else {
      if (Dic[word])
        std::cout << "yes" << std::endl;
      else
        std::cout << "no" << std::endl;
    }
  }
}
```
