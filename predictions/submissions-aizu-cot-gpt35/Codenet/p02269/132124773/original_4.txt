Step 1: Avoid unnecessary includes
The program includes the `<iostream>` and `<string>` libraries, which are not used in the program. We can remove these unnecessary includes to optimize the program.

Step 2: Avoid using "using namespace std"
The program uses the "using namespace std" directive, which brings all the names from the std namespace into the current namespace. This can lead to namespace conflicts and make the code harder to maintain. Instead, we can use the std:: prefix to indicate the std namespace explicitly when using its members.

Step 3: Optimize the map lookup
The program uses a map to store the dictionary entries. When checking if a word exists in the dictionary, the program performs a map lookup each time. This can be optimized by using the find function of the map, which has a time complexity of O(log n), compared to the [] operator, which has a time complexity of O(log n) for insertion but O(1) for access.

Step 4: Use a more efficient data structure
The map data structure has a memory overhead due to its internal tree structure. In this case, we can use an unordered_set instead of a map to store the dictionary entries. The unordered_set has a constant time complexity for insertion and lookup, and it consumes less memory compared to the map.

Optimized code:
```
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_set>
#include <string>

int main() {
  int n;
  std::cin >> n;

  std::unordered_set<std::string> dictionary;
  std::string command, word;

  while (n--) {
    std::cin >> command >> word;
    if (command[0] == 'i') {
      dictionary.insert(word);
    } else {
      if (dictionary.find(word) != dictionary.end()) {
        std::cout << "yes" << std::endl;
      } else {
        std::cout << "no" << std::endl;
      }
    }
  }

  return 0;
}
```
