Explanation of the optimization steps:

1. Remove unnecessary header files: The program does not use any features from the `<iostream>` and `<string>` header files, so we can remove them.

2. Remove the `using namespace std` statement: It is generally considered a bad practice to use the `using namespace std` statement because it can lead to naming conflicts. Instead, we can use the `std::` prefix for the necessary standard library functions and types.

3. Optimize the map usage: The original program uses a `std::map` to store the words. However, for this problem, we only need to check if a word exists in the dictionary or not. Using a `std::set` instead of `std::map` can improve the running time and reduce memory usage.

4. Use `std::unordered_set` for further optimization: The `std::unordered_set` container provides constant time complexity for insertions and lookups. By replacing the `std::set` with `std::unordered_set`, we can achieve further optimization.

Optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_set>
#include <string>

int main() {
  int n;
  std::cin >> n;
  std::unordered_set<std::string> dictionary;
  
  std::string command, word;
  while (n--) {
    std::cin >> command >> word;
    if (command[0] == 'i')
      dictionary.insert(word);
    else {
      if (dictionary.count(word) > 0)
        std::cout << "yes" << std::endl;
      else
        std::cout << "no" << std::endl;
    }
  }
}
```
