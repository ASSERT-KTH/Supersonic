Step 1: Remove unnecessary namespace declaration
The "using namespace std;" statement is not necessary in this program because there are no references to any standard library functions or classes. Removing this statement will improve readability and potentially reduce compilation time.

Step 2: Optimize the "c" function
Currently, the "c" function converts a string of characters into an integer representation. It does this by iterating through each character in the string, shifting the current value left by 2 bits, and adding the corresponding value from the "k" array.

One optimization we can make is to use the bitwise OR operator instead of bitwise addition. Since we are only dealing with values from 0 to 3, the bitwise OR operator will give us the same result as addition. This eliminates the need for the "k" array and improves performance.

Another optimization we can make is to replace the loop with a pointer-based approach. This eliminates the need for indexing and reduces the number of memory accesses, resulting in faster execution.

Step 3: Optimize the main loop
In the main loop, the program reads two strings and performs an "insert" or "find" operation based on the first character of the first string. Currently, the program calls the "c" function twice for each operation, resulting in redundant calculations.

To optimize this, we can calculate the integer representation of the string once and store it in a variable. Then, we can use this variable for both the "insert" and "find" operations.

Final optimized code:

```cpp
#include <cstdio>

bool d[33554432];

int c(const char* str) {
  int ans = *str;
  while (*(++str) != '\0') {
    ans <<= 2;
    ans |= (*str & 3);
  }
  return ans;
}

int main() {
  int n;
  scanf("%d", &n);
  
  char s[7], str[12];
  
  while (n--) {
    scanf("%s %s", s, str);
    int key = c(str);
    
    if (s[0] == 'i')
      d[key] = true;
    else
      puts(d[key] ? "yes" : "no");
  }
  
  return 0;
}
```
