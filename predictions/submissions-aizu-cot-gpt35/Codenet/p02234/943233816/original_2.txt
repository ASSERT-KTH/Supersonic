The given program is implementing the matrix chain multiplication problem using dynamic programming. The program calculates the minimum number of scalar multiplications required to multiply a chain of matrices.

To optimize the program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove the unnecessary `#define INF 100000000` line as it is not used in the code.

2. Instead of using a 2D array `m[101][101]` to store the results of subproblems, we can use a 1D array `m[101]` to store only the necessary values. Since we only need the values of the previous row for each iteration, we can overwrite the values as we go along.

3. Instead of initializing the entire `m` array to zero in each iteration of the inner loop, we can initialize only the necessary values. We can initialize `m[i][i]` to zero outside the loop, and update the initialization of `m[i][j]` inside the loop for `l = 2`.

4. Remove the unused variable `x` in the `main` function.

5. Remove the unused variable `k` in the `main` function.

6. Remove the unnecessary check `if (i < n - 1)` inside the loop for reading input values. Since the loop iterates `n` times, the last iteration will not execute the `scanf` statement, so we don't need to check for `i < n - 1`.

Here is the optimized version of the program:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int p[101];
int m[101];

int matrixChainOrder(int pl) {
  int n = pl - 1;
  int i, j, k, q;

  for (i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
    m[i] = 0;
  }

  for (int l = 2; l <= n; l++) {
    for (i = 1; i <= n - l + 1; i++) {
      j = i + l - 1;
      m[i] = INT_MAX;
      for (k = i; k < j; k++) {
        q = m[k] + m[k + 1] + p[i - 1] * p[k] * p[j];
        if (m[i] > q)
          m[i] = q;
      }
    }
  }

  return m[1];
}

int main() {
  int n, i;

  scanf("%d", &n);
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    scanf("%d", &p[i]);
  }
  scanf("%d", &p[n]);

  int result = matrixChainOrder(n + 1);
  printf("%d\n", result);

  return 0;
}
```

By making these optimizations, we have reduced the memory usage by using a 1D array instead of a 2D array and improved the running time by removing unnecessary initializations and unused variables.
