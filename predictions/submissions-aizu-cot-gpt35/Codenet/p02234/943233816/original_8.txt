The given program calculates the minimum number of scalar multiplications required to multiply a chain of matrices. The program uses a dynamic programming approach to solve the problem.

To optimize the program, I would suggest the following steps:

1. Remove the unnecessary inclusion of the `stdio.h` library, as it is not used in the program.

2. Replace the macro `INF` with a constant variable. This will improve code readability.

3. Declare the variables `n`, `i`, `j`, `l`, `k`, `q` as close to their usage as possible, rather than declaring them all at the beginning of the `matrixChainOrder` function. This will reduce the scope of the variables, making the code cleaner.

4. Initialize the variables `n` and `x` with a value of 0. This is not necessary, as they will be assigned new values later.

5. Use a more meaningful name for the variable `pl` in the `matrixChainOrder` function. For example, `numMatrices` or `numDimensions` would be more descriptive.

6. Instead of using a 2D array `m` to store the minimum number of scalar multiplications, use a 1D array `m` with a size of `n+1`. This will reduce the memory usage.

7. Modify the loop conditions in the `matrixChainOrder` function to iterate from `0` to `n` instead of `1` to `n`. This will simplify the loop logic.

8. Instead of using `p[i-1]`, use `p[i]` directly in the calculation of `q`. This will simplify the code.

9. Remove the unused variable `x` from the `main` function.

Here is the optimized program:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

const int INF = 100000000;

int matrixChainOrder(int numMatrices) {
  int n = numMatrices - 1;
  int m[n+1];
  int p[n+1];
  
  for (int i = 0; i <= n; i++) {
    m[i] = 0;
  }
  
  for (int l = 2; l <= n; l++) {
    for (int i = 0; i <= n - l; i++) {
      int j = i + l;
      m[i][j] = INF;
      for (int k = i; k < j; k++) {
        int q = m[i][k] + m[k + 1][j] + p[i] * p[k] * p[j];
        if (m[i][j] > q)
          m[i][j] = q;
      }
    }
  }
  
  return m[0][n];
}

int main() {
  int n;
  scanf("%d", &n);
  
  int p[n+1];
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    scanf("%d", &p[i]);
    if (i < n - 1)
      scanf("%d", &p[i+1]);
  }
  
  printf("%d\n", matrixChainOrder(n + 1));
  return 0;
}
```

These optimizations should improve the running time and reduce the memory usage of the program.
