The given program is a recursive implementation of a subset sum problem. It checks whether a given sum can be achieved using a subset of the given array of numbers.

To optimize this program, we can use memoization to avoid redundant calculations. We can create a 2D array to store the results of previous calculations and reuse them when necessary.

Here are the steps to optimize the program:

1. Remove unnecessary header files: The program includes several unnecessary header files. We can remove them to improve compile time and reduce memory usage.

2. Remove unnecessary includes: We only need `<iostream>` and `<cstdio>` for input/output operations. We can remove the rest of the includes.

3. Replace `int *N` with `vector<int> N`: Instead of using a raw array and manually managing memory, we can use a `vector` to store the array of numbers. This simplifies memory management and allows us to use the `size()` function to get the size of the array.

4. Create a 2D array `dp` for memoization: We can create a 2D array `dp` of size `(n+1) x (m+1)` to store the results of previous calculations. Initialize all elements of `dp` to -1, indicating that the corresponding result is not calculated yet.

5. Modify the `solve` function to use memoization: In the `solve` function, before making recursive calls, check if the result for the current state `(i, m)` is already calculated and stored in the `dp` array. If it is, return the stored result. Otherwise, calculate the result and store it in the `dp` array before returning it.

6. Print the results directly without using `endl`: Instead of using `endl` to print a new line, we can use `"\n"` which is faster as it doesn't flush the output buffer.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cstdio>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

vector<int> N;
int n;
vector<vector<int>> dp;

bool solve(int i, int m) {
  if (i == n) {
    return m == 0;
  }

  if (dp[i][m] != -1) {
    return dp[i][m];
  }

  bool result = solve(i + 1, m - N[i]) || solve(i + 1, m);
  dp[i][m] = result;
  return result;
}

int main() {
  int t;
  scanf("%d", &n);
  N.resize(n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    scanf("%d", &N[i]);
  }
  scanf("%d", &t);

  dp.resize(n + 1, vector<int>(t + 1, -1));

  for (int i = 0; i < t; i++) {
    int p;
    scanf("%d", &p);
    if (solve(0, p)) {
      cout << "yes\n";
    } else {
      cout << "no\n";
    }
  }

  return 0;
}
```

This optimized program uses memoization to store the results of previous calculations, avoiding redundant recursive calls. It also prints the results using `"\n"` instead of `endl` for better performance.
