The given program is a recursive implementation of a subset sum problem. It checks if there is a subset of the given array `N` that sums up to a given target value `p`.

The optimization can be done by using dynamic programming to avoid redundant calculations. We can use a memoization technique to store the results of previously solved subproblems and reuse them when needed.

Here are the steps for optimizing the program:

1. Remove unnecessary headers: The program includes several unnecessary headers that are not used. We can remove them to improve compilation time and reduce memory usage.

2. Remove unnecessary `#include <cstdlib>`: The `cstdlib` header is not used in the program, so we can remove it.

3. Change the type of `N` from `int*` to `vector<int>`: Instead of using a dynamically allocated array, we can use a `vector` to store the input array `N`. This will simplify memory management and avoid potential memory leaks.

4. Use `cin` and `cout` instead of `scanf` and `printf`: The program currently uses `scanf` and `printf` for input and output. We can replace them with `cin` and `cout`, which are generally faster in C++.

5. Use memoization to optimize the `solve` function: We can use a 2D array to store the results of previously solved subproblems. The array will have dimensions `n` (number of elements in `N`) and `m` (target value). Before making a recursive call, we can check if the result for the current parameters `i` and `m` already exists in the memoization array. If it does, we can return the stored result instead of recalculating it.

6. Initialize the memoization array: Before making any recursive calls, we need to initialize the memoization array with a special value, such as -1, to indicate that the result for the corresponding parameters has not been calculated yet.

7. Modify the `main` function to use the optimized `solve` function: Instead of calling the original `solve` function, we will call the modified version that uses memoization.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

vector<int> N;
int n;
vector<vector<int>> memo;

bool solve(int i, int m) {
  if (i == n) {
    return m == 0;
  }

  if (memo[i][m] != -1) {
    return memo[i][m];
  }

  bool result = solve(i + 1, m - N[i]) || solve(i + 1, m);
  memo[i][m] = result;
  return result;
}

int main() {
  int t;
  cin >> n;
  N.resize(n);
  memo.resize(n, vector<int>(10001, -1));

  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> N[i];
  }

  cin >> t;

  for (int i = 0; i < t; i++) {
    int p;
    cin >> p;

    if (solve(0, p)) {
      cout << "yes" << endl;
    } else {
      cout << "no" << endl;
    }
  }

  return 0;
}
```

This optimized program uses memoization to store and reuse the results of previously solved subproblems. The memoization array is initialized with -1, indicating that the result for the corresponding parameters has not been calculated yet. If the result is already stored in the memoization array, it is returned directly without further recursion. Otherwise, the result is calculated recursively and stored in the memoization array for future use.
