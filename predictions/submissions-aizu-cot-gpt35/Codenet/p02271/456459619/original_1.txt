The given program is using a recursive approach to solve a problem. However, it is inefficient because it repeatedly solves the same subproblems, leading to a high time complexity.

To optimize the program, we can use dynamic programming to avoid redundant calculations.

Here's the step-by-step optimization:

1. Remove unnecessary header files that are not used in the program.

2. Remove the unused `deque`, `list`, `queue`, `stack`, and `complex` libraries.

3. Pass the `N` array by reference instead of using a global pointer. This will eliminate the need for dynamically allocating memory.

4. Create a 2D boolean array `dp` of size `n+1` by `m+1`, where `n` is the length of the array `N` and `m` is the maximum value in `N`. Initially, all elements of `dp` will be set to `false`.

5. Set `dp[0][0]` to `true` to handle the base case.

6. For each `i` from `1` to `n`, set `dp[i][0]` to `true` to handle the case when the sum is `0`.

7. For each `i` from `1` to `n` and each `j` from `1` to `m`, set `dp[i][j]` to `true` if either `dp[i-1][j]` or `dp[i-1][j-N[i-1]]` is `true`. Otherwise, set `dp[i][j]` to `false`.

8. In the `solve` function, return `dp[n][m]` instead of recursively calling `solve`.

Here's the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

bool solve(vector<int>& N, int m) {
  int n = N.size();
  vector<vector<bool>> dp(n+1, vector<bool>(m+1, false));
  dp[0][0] = true;
  
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    dp[i][0] = true;
  }
  
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    for (int j = 1; j <= m; j++) {
      dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j];
      if (j >= N[i-1]) {
        dp[i][j] = dp[i][j] || dp[i-1][j-N[i-1]];
      }
    }
  }
  
  return dp[n][m];
}

int main() {
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  vector<int> N(n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> N[i];
  }
  
  int t;
  cin >> t;
  for (int i = 0; i < t; i++) {
    int p;
    cin >> p;
    if (solve(N, p)) {
      cout << "yes" << endl;
    } else {
      cout << "no" << endl;
    }
  }
}
```

This optimized program will have a lower time complexity and will use less memory compared to the original program.
