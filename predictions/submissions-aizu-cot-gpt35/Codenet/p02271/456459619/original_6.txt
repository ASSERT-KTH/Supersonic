Step 1: Avoid using unnecessary headers
The program includes several headers that are not needed for this particular code. We can remove them to improve the compilation time.

Step 2: Avoid using global variables
The variable `N` is declared as a global variable. It would be better to declare it locally in the `main()` function.

Step 3: Avoid unnecessary memory allocation
The program allocates memory for the array `N` using `calloc()`. Since the size of the array is known at compile-time, we can use a stack-allocated array instead.

Step 4: Optimize the solve() function
The `solve()` function uses recursion to solve the problem. However, it can be optimized by using dynamic programming to avoid redundant calculations.

Step 5: Avoid unnecessary ternary operator
The ternary operator `m == 0 ? true : false` is not necessary since the expression `m == 0` already returns a boolean value.

Here is the optimized C++ program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

bool solve(int* N, int n, int i, int m, bool** memo) {
  if (i == n) {
    return m == 0;
  }
  
  if (memo[i][m] != -1) {
    return memo[i][m];
  }
  
  bool res = solve(N, n, i + 1, m - N[i], memo) || solve(N, n, i + 1, m, memo);
  memo[i][m] = res;
  return res;
}

int main() {
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  int N[n];
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> N[i];
  }
  
  int t;
  cin >> t;
  
  bool** memo = new bool*[n];
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    memo[i] = new bool[t + 1];
    memset(memo[i], -1, sizeof(bool) * (t + 1));
  }
  
  for (int i = 0; i < t; i++) {
    int p;
    cin >> p;
    if (solve(N, n, 0, p, memo)) {
      cout << "yes" << endl;
    } else {
      cout << "no" << endl;
    }
  }
  
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    delete[] memo[i];
  }
  delete[] memo;
}
```

Explanation:
- The unnecessary headers are removed.
- The `N` variable is declared locally in the `main()` function.
- Instead of using `calloc()` to allocate memory, we use a stack-allocated array `int N[n]`.
- The `solve()` function is modified to use dynamic programming with memoization. We use a 2D array `memo` to store the already computed results of subproblems. The value -1 is used to indicate that a subproblem has not been solved yet.
- The redundant ternary operator is removed.
