The original program is using a recursive function `solve` to solve a problem of subset sum. The function recursively checks if there is a subset of the given set that sums up to a given target value.

To optimize the program, we can use dynamic programming to avoid redundant calculations.

Here are the optimization steps:

1. Remove unnecessary header files that are not used in the program.
2. Change the `N` array to a vector, which will automatically manage its memory.
3. Modify the `solve` function to use memoization.
4. Initialize a 2D boolean array `dp` of size `(n+1) x (m+1)` where `n` is the number of elements in the set and `m` is the target value.
5. Set the base case values in `dp` such that `dp[i][0]` is always `true` for any `i` and `dp[0][j]` is always `false` for any `j` except `dp[0][0]` which is `true`.
6. Use a nested loop to fill in the `dp` array. For each `i` from `1` to `n`, and each `j` from `1` to `m`, set `dp[i][j]` to `true` if either `dp[i-1][j]` is `true` or `dp[i-1][j-N[i-1]]` is `true`, otherwise set it to `false`.
7. Modify the `solve` function to use the `dp` array. Instead of recursively calling `solve`, directly return `dp[n][m]`.
8. In the main function, remove the memory allocation using `calloc` and use the `vector` constructor to initialize the `N` vector.
9. Print "yes" or "no" directly instead of using `cout` and `endl`.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

bool solve(const vector<int>& N, int m, vector<vector<bool>>& dp) {
  int n = N.size();
  for (int i = 0; i <= n; i++) {
    dp[i][0] = true;
  }
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    for (int j = 1; j <= m; j++) {
      if (j < N[i-1]) {
        dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j];
      } else {
        dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] || dp[i-1][j-N[i-1]];
      }
    }
  }
  return dp[n][m];
}

int main() {
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  vector<int> N(n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> N[i];
  }
  int t;
  cin >> t;
  for (int i = 0; i < t; i++) {
    int p;
    cin >> p;
    vector<vector<bool>> dp(n+1, vector<bool>(p+1, false));
    if (solve(N, p, dp)) {
      cout << "yes\n";
    } else {
      cout << "no\n";
    }
  }
}
```

The optimized program uses dynamic programming to solve the subset sum problem efficiently. It avoids redundant calculations by using a memoization table `dp`. The time complexity of the optimized program is O(n * m), where n is the number of elements in the set and m is the target value. The space complexity is also O(n * m) due to the memoization table.
