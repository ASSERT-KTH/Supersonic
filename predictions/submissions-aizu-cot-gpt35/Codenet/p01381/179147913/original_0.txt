Step 1: Remove unnecessary includes

The program includes the `<cstdio>` header but does not use any of its functions. Therefore, we can remove this unnecessary include statement.

Step 2: Optimize the loop condition

The program uses a `while` loop with the `cin` statement as the loop condition. This means that the loop will continue as long as the `cin` statement is successful in reading values for `n` and `k`. However, this condition can be optimized by directly checking the values of `n` and `k` inside the loop. If `n` or `k` is 0, we can break out of the loop since it is not necessary to continue.

Step 3: Optimize the array initialization

The program initializes the array `p` with `n + 2` elements. However, the loop that follows only fills `n` elements of the array. Therefore, we can reduce the size of the array to `n` elements.

Step 4: Optimize the printing of the newline character

The program uses the `printf` statement to print a newline character after each iteration of the outer loop. However, we can optimize this by using `cout` instead and simply printing a newline character using `endl`.

Step 5: Optimize the printing of integers

The program uses the `printf` statement to print integers. However, we can optimize this by using `cout` instead and simply printing the integers using the `<<` operator.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  int n, k;
  while (true) {
    cin >> n >> k;
    if (n == 0 || k == 0) {
      break;
    }
    if (n / 2 < k) {
      cout << "-1" << endl;
      continue;
    }
    int p[n];
    p[0] = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i < n; i += 2) {
      p[i] = i / 2 + 1;
      p[i + 1] = n - p[i];
    }
    for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
      if (i != 0) {
        cout << endl;
      }
      for (int j = 0; j < n - 1; j++) {
        int a = (p[j] + i) % n + 1;
        int b = (p[j + 1] + i) % n + 1;
        cout << a << " " << b << endl;
      }
    }
  }
}
```
