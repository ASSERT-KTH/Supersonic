The given program reads four integers from the user and prints their sum in a specific format. It continues reading and printing until the first integer entered is 0.

To optimize this program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove the unnecessary loop that prints 110,000 opening parentheses. This loop does not serve any purpose and only increases the running time and memory usage of the program.

2. Instead of storing the four integers in an array, we can directly use separate variables for each integer. This eliminates the need for an array and reduces memory usage.

3. We can use a more efficient loop condition to check for the termination condition. Instead of checking if the first integer is equal to 0 inside the loop, we can use a while loop with the termination condition as the input itself. This avoids unnecessary iterations of the loop.

Here is the optimized version of the program:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  int a, b, c, d;

  while (scanf("%d", &a) == 1 && a != 0) {
    scanf("%d%d%d", &b, &c, &d);
    printf("%d+%d+%d+%d\n", a, b, c, d);
  }

  return 0;
}
```

In this optimized version, we directly read the input integers into separate variables `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`. We use a while loop with the condition `scanf("%d", &a) == 1 && a != 0` to continue reading and printing until the first integer entered is 0. Finally, we print the sum of the four integers in the desired format.
