The given program reads four integers from the user and prints their sum in a specific format. It continues to do so until the user enters a zero as the first integer.

To optimize this program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove the unnecessary loop to read four integers. Instead, we can use `scanf` directly to read four integers at once.
2. Remove the loop that prints 110,000 opening parentheses. This loop does not serve any purpose and only adds unnecessary overhead.
3. Change the format specifier in `printf` to use `%d` for each integer instead of `%d+%d+%d+%d`. This will eliminate the need for string concatenation and simplify the output statement.

Here is the optimized version of the program:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  int a[4];
  while (1) {
    scanf("%d %d %d %d", &a[0], &a[1], &a[2], &a[3]);
    if (a[0] == 0) {
      break;
    }
    printf("%d+%d+%d+%d\n", a[0], a[1], a[2], a[3]);
  }
}
```
