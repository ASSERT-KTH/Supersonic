The given program reads four integers from the user in a loop, checks if the first integer is zero, and if not, prints the sum of the four integers surrounded by 110000 opening parentheses.

To optimize the program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove the unnecessary loop that prints 110000 opening parentheses. This loop does not serve any purpose and only wastes CPU cycles and memory.

2. Instead of storing the input integers in an array, we can directly use variables to store them. This eliminates the need for an array and reduces memory usage.

3. Since the program only needs to check if the first integer is zero, we can simplify the code by using a single variable instead of an array. This reduces memory usage and improves readability.

4. We can also remove the `while (1)` loop by using a `do-while` loop. This way, the loop will always execute at least once, eliminating the need for an initial check.

Here is the optimized program:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  int a, b, c, d;
  
  do {
    scanf("%d", &a);
    if (a == 0) {
      break;
    }
    scanf("%d %d %d", &b, &c, &d);
    printf("%d+%d+%d+%d\n", a, b, c, d);
  } while (1);
}
```
