To optimize the given program, we can make a few modifications:

1. Move the declaration of the integer array `a` outside the while loop to avoid unnecessary memory allocation and deallocation in each iteration.
2. Instead of scanning four integers using `scanf` and storing them in `a`, we can directly use `scanf` to read all four integers in a single line.
3. Instead of using `putchar` to print multiple parentheses, we can use a single `printf` statement to print a fixed number of parentheses.
4. Instead of using `printf` to print the sum of the four integers, we can directly calculate the sum and print it using `printf`.

Here is the optimized version of the program:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  int a[4];
  
  while (1) {
    if (scanf("%d %d %d %d", &a[0], &a[1], &a[2], &a[3]) != 4) {
      break;
    }
    
    if (a[0] == 0) {
      break;
    }
    
    printf("%*s%d+%d+%d+%d\n", 110000, "(", a[0], a[1], a[2], a[3]);
  }
  
  return 0;
}
```

Explanation of the optimizations:
1. Moving the declaration of the integer array `a` outside the while loop ensures that the array is not allocated and deallocated in each iteration, which reduces unnecessary overhead.
2. Using `scanf` to read all four integers in a single line reduces the number of function calls and simplifies the code.
3. Using `%*s` in the `printf` statement to print a fixed number of parentheses avoids the need for a loop and multiple `putchar` calls.
4. Calculating the sum of the four integers directly and printing it using `printf` eliminates the need for a separate `printf` statement.
