The given program reads four integers from the user and prints their sum in a specific format. It continues doing this until the first integer entered is 0.

To optimize this program for running time and memory usage, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove the unnecessary loop that prints 110,000 opening parenthesis characters before printing the sum. This loop is not needed and only adds unnecessary processing time and memory usage.

2. Use a single `printf` statement to print the sum of the four integers instead of separate `printf` statements for each integer. This will reduce the number of function calls and improve performance.

Here is the optimized program:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  int a[4];
  
  while (1) {
    for (int i = 0; i < 4; ++i) {
      scanf("%d", &a[i]);
    }
    
    if (a[0] == 0) {
      break;
    }
    
    printf("%d+%d+%d+%d\n", a[0], a[1], a[2], a[3]);
  }
  
  return 0;
}
```

Explanation:
- We removed the unnecessary loop that prints 110,000 opening parenthesis characters.
- We replaced the separate `printf` statements for each integer with a single `printf` statement that prints the sum of all four integers.
- We added a `return 0;` statement at the end of the `main` function for completeness, although it is not strictly necessary.
