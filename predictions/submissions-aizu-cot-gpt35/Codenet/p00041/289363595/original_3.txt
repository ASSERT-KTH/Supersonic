To optimize the given program, we can make the following changes:

1. Instead of using a fixed-size array `a` with size 4, we can use individual variables `a, b, c, d` to store the input values. This way, we don't need to initialize an array every time the loop runs.

2. We can remove the `if (a[0] == 0)` condition and break statement. Instead, we can break the loop when the first input value is zero.

3. We can remove the loop that prints 110,000 parentheses. This loop seems unnecessary and doesn't contribute to the functionality of the program.

4. We can remove the `putchar('\n')` statement and instead use `printf("\n")` to print a newline character.

Here is the optimized version of the program:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  int a, b, c, d;
  
  while (1) {
    scanf("%d", &a);
    
    if (a == 0) {
      break;
    }
    
    scanf("%d %d %d", &b, &c, &d);
    
    printf("%d+%d+%d+%d\n", a, b, c, d);
  }
}
```
