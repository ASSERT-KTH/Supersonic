First, let's analyze the given C program and identify areas for optimization:

1. The program uses a fixed-size array `a` to store input values. This limits the program to only process 4 values at a time.

2. The program uses an infinite loop `while(1)` to continuously read input values until the condition `a[0] == 0` is met.

3. Inside the loop, the program uses a nested loop to read 4 values from the user using `scanf()`. This loop can be optimized to read the values in a more efficient way.

4. After reading the values, the program checks if `a[0]` is equal to 0. If true, it breaks the loop and terminates the program.

5. If `a[0]` is not equal to 0, the program prints a large number of opening parenthesis characters `(` using a loop with 110000 iterations. This loop can be optimized to reduce the number of iterations.

6. After printing the opening parenthesis characters, the program prints the sum of the 4 input values using `printf()`.

7. Finally, the program prints a newline character using `putchar('\n')`.

Based on this analysis, here's the optimized C program:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  int a[4];
  
  while (1) {
    scanf("%d %d %d %d", &a[0], &a[1], &a[2], &a[3]);
    
    if (a[0] == 0) {
      break;
    }
    
    for (int i = 0; i < 110000; ++i)
      putchar('(');
    
    printf("%d+%d+%d+%d\n", a[0], a[1], a[2], a[3]);
  }
}
```

Explanation of the optimizations:

1. Instead of using a nested loop to read 4 values from the user, we can modify the `scanf()` function to read all 4 values in a single call. This reduces the number of loop iterations and improves input processing efficiency.

2. The loop condition `a[0] == 0` remains unchanged as it is required to break the loop when the input condition is met.

3. The loop that prints opening parenthesis characters is left unchanged as it is necessary to reproduce the original program's behavior.

4. The `printf()` function call for printing the sum of the 4 input values is modified to include the newline character `\n` at the end. This ensures proper formatting and readability of the output.

Overall, these optimizations improve the efficiency of the program by reducing the number of loop iterations and improving input processing.
