To optimize the given C++ program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The program includes the `<cstring>` header, but it's not used in the code. We can remove this include statement.

2. Replace the `std::queue` with a `std::deque`: The program currently uses a `std::queue` to store the intermediate positions during the BFS traversal. However, `std::queue` uses a `std::deque` as its underlying container, and using a `std::deque` directly can provide better performance. We can replace `std::queue` with `std::deque` for better efficiency.

3. Optimize the `visited` array size: The `visited` array is currently defined as `bool visited[51][51][51][51]`. This array is used to store the visited states during the BFS traversal. However, the dimensions of the array are not correct. The correct dimensions should be `bool visited[51][51][51][51]` to match the size of the input grid. We can update the size of the `visited` array to match the correct dimensions.

4. Use a `std::vector` instead of an array for `mp`: The program currently uses a 2D array `mp[2][51]` to store the input grid. However, using a `std::vector` instead of an array can provide better flexibility and performance. We can replace the array with a `std::vector<std::vector<std::string>>` to store the input grid.

Optimized C++ program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <deque>

struct po {
  int lx, ly, rx, ry;
};

int w, h;
std::vector<std::vector<std::string>> mp;
std::vector<std::vector<std::vector<std::vector<bool>>>> visited;
int dx[4] = {0, 0, 1, -1};
int dy[4] = {1, -1, 0, 0};

bool bfs(int lx, int ly, int rx, int ry) {
  std::deque<po> Q;
  Q.push_back((po){lx, ly, rx, ry});

  while (!Q.empty()) {
    po t = Q.front();
    Q.pop_front();
    int cnt = (mp[0][t.ly][t.lx] == '%') + (mp[1][t.ry][t.rx] == '%');

    if (cnt == 2)
      return true;

    if (visited[t.lx][t.ly][t.rx][t.ry] || cnt == 1)
      continue;

    visited[t.lx][t.ly][t.rx][t.ry] = true;

    for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
      int flg = 0;
      int nlx = t.lx + dx[i], nly = t.ly + dy[i];
      int nrx = t.rx - dx[i], nry = t.ry + dy[i];

      if (nlx < 0 || nly < 0 || nlx >= w || nly >= h || mp[0][nly][nlx] == '#')
        nlx = t.lx, nly = t.ly, flg++;

      if (nrx < 0 || nry < 0 || nrx >= w || nry >= h || mp[1][nry][nrx] == '#')
        nrx = t.rx, nry = t.ry, flg++;

      if (flg == 2)
        continue;

      Q.push_back((po){nlx, nly, nrx, nry});
    }
  }

  return false;
}

int main() {
  while (1) {
    std::cin >> w >> h;
    if (!w && !h)
      break;

    mp.resize(2, std::vector<std::string>(h));
    visited.resize(w, std::vector<std::vector<std::vector<bool>>>(h, std::vector<std::vector<bool>>(w, std::vector<bool>(h, false))));

    for (int i = 0; i < h; i++)
      std::cin >> mp[0][i] >> mp[1][i];

    int lx, ly, rx, ry;

    for (int i = 0; i < h; i++) {
      for (int j = 0; j < w; j++) {
        if (mp[0][i][j] == 'L')
          lx = j, ly = i;
        if (mp[1][i][j] == 'R')
          rx = j, ry = i;
      }
    }

    if (bfs(lx, ly, rx, ry))
      std::cout << "Yes" << std::endl;
    else
      std::cout << "No" << std::endl;
  }

  return 0;
}
```

Explanation of optimizations:

1. Removed unnecessary includes: The `<cstring>` header was not used in the code, so it was removed.

2. Replaced `std::queue` with `std::deque`: The `std::queue` was replaced with `std::deque` to improve the performance of pushing and popping elements.

3. Optimized the `visited` array size: The `visited` array was resized to match the correct dimensions of the input grid. This ensures that only the required memory is allocated for the `visited` array.

4. Used `std::vector` instead of an array for `mp`: `std::vector` provides better flexibility and performance compared to arrays. The `mp` array was replaced with a `std::vector<std::vector<std::string>>` to store the input grid.
