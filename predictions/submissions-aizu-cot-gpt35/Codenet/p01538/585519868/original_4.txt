To optimize the given program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary include statements: The program includes unnecessary header files such as `<algorithm>`, `<cmath>`, `<queue>`, `<stack>`, and `<vector>`. Since these headers are not used in the program, we can remove them to improve compilation time and memory usage.

2. Use `std::array` instead of dynamic memory allocation: The program currently uses dynamic memory allocation to create a boolean array `table`. We can replace this with `std::array<bool, 1000001>` to avoid the overhead of dynamic memory allocation and deallocation.

3. Avoid unnecessary initialization of `table` array: The program initializes the `table` array to `false` in every iteration of the outer loop. We can remove this initialization since the array is already initialized to `false` when it is created.

4. Avoid unnecessary check if `N / 10 == 0`: The program checks if `N / 10 == 0` in every iteration of the inner loop. Since the inner loop calculates the maximum product of digits, we can modify the loop condition to `N != 0` to avoid this unnecessary check.

5. Use a more descriptive variable name instead of `max`: The variable `max` is used to store the maximum product of digits. However, `max` is a reserved keyword in C++, so it is better to use a different variable name.

Based on these optimizations, the optimized program is as follows:

```cpp
#include <stdio.h>
#include <array>

int main() {
  int Q, N, count, tmp, maxProduct, S;
  bool FLG;
  scanf("%d", &Q);
  std::array<bool, 1000001> table;
  for (int loop = 0; loop < Q; loop++) {
    count = 0;
    scanf("%d", &N);
    table.fill(false);
    table[N] = true;
    FLG = false;
    while (N != 0) {
      maxProduct = 0;
      for (S = 10; N / S != 0; S *= 10) {
        tmp = (N / S) * (N % S);
        maxProduct = (maxProduct >= tmp) ? maxProduct : tmp;
      }
      N = maxProduct;
      if (table[N]) {
        FLG = true;
        break;
      } else {
        table[N] = true;
        count++;
      }
    }
    if (FLG) {
      printf("-1\n");
    } else {
      printf("%d\n", count);
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```

These optimizations should improve the running time and memory usage of the program.
