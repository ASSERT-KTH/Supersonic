The given program calculates the count of iterations required to reach a repeating number based on a mathematical operation. The program utilizes a boolean array called `table` to keep track of the numbers that have already been encountered.

To optimize the program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary header files: The program includes several unnecessary header files (`<algorithm>`, `<cmath>`, `<queue>`, `<stack>`, `<stdio.h>`, `<vector>`) that are not used. We can remove these to reduce the compilation time and memory usage.

2. Use `std::vector<bool>` instead of a dynamic array: Instead of using a dynamically allocated boolean array (`bool *table = new bool[1000001]`), we can use a `std::vector<bool> table(1000001)` which provides better memory management and avoids potential memory leaks.

3. Remove unnecessary initialization of `table` inside the loop: The program initializes the `table` array inside the loop for each test case. However, this is unnecessary as we can simply clear the array using `table.clear()` after each test case.

4. Replace the `if (table[N] == true)` condition with `if (table[N])`: We can simplify the condition to `if (table[N])` as it already evaluates to a boolean value.

5. Use `std::max` instead of the ternary operator: Instead of using the ternary operator to update the `max` variable (`max = (max >= tmp) ? max : tmp`), we can use the `std::max` function from the `<algorithm>` header to simplify the code.

Based on these optimizations, the optimized program is as follows:

```cpp
#include <stdio.h>
#include <vector>

int main() {
  int Q, N, count, tmp, max, S;
  bool FLG;
  scanf("%d", &Q);
  std::vector<bool> table(1000001);
  for (int loop = 0; loop < Q; loop++) {
    table.clear();
    count = 0;
    scanf("%d", &N);
    table[N] = true;
    FLG = false;
    while (true) {
      if (N / 10 == 0)
        break;
      max = 0;
      for (S = 10; N / S != 0; S *= 10) {
        tmp = (N / S) * (N % S);
        max = std::max(max, tmp);
      }
      N = max;
      if (table[N]) {
        FLG = true;
        break;
      } else {
        table[N] = true;
        count++;
      }
    }
    if (FLG) {
      printf("-1\n");
    } else {
      printf("%d\n", count);
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```

These optimizations should improve the running time and memory usage of the program.
