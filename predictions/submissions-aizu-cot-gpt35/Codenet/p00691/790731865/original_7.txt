The given program calculates the minimum value of `z^3 - i^3 - j^3` for each `z` from 1 to 1111, where `i` and `j` are integers such that `1 <= i < z` and `j` is the largest integer such that `j^3 <= z^3 - i^3`. The program stores the results in the array `ans`.

To optimize the program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary headers: The program includes the `<algorithm>` header, but there are no algorithm functions used in the code. We can remove this header.

2. Remove unnecessary array `tb`: The array `tb` is used to store the cubes of numbers from 1 to 1111. Instead of using this array, we can directly calculate the cube of `i` inside the `nr` function.

3. Improve `nr` function: The `nr` function is used to find the largest integer `j` such that `j^3 <= a`. Currently, it iterates from 2 to 1111, checking if the cube of each number is greater than `a`. We can optimize this by using a binary search instead of linear search.

4. Improve `calc` function: The `calc` function calculates the minimum value of `z^3 - i^3 - j^3` for each `i` from 1 to `z-1`. Currently, it iterates from 1 to `z-1`, calculating the cube of `i` and finding the largest cube less than `z^3 - i^3` using the `nr` function. We can optimize this by calculating `z^3` only once and storing it in a variable.

Here is the optimized C++ program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int ans[1112], N;

int nr(int a) {
  int ret = 1;
  int low = 1, high = 1111;
  while (low <= high) {
    int mid = low + (high - low) / 2;
    int cube = mid * mid * mid;
    if (cube <= a) {
      ret = mid;
      low = mid + 1;
    } else {
      high = mid - 1;
    }
  }
  return ret;
}

int calc(int z) {
  int z3 = z * z * z;
  int ret = z3;
  for (int i = 1; i < z; i++) {
    int i3 = i * i * i;
    int j3 = nr(z3 - i3);
    if (i3 + j3 >= z3)
      break;
    ret = min(ret, z3 - i3 - j3);
  }
  return ret;
}

int main() {
  for (int i = 1; i < 1112; i++)
    ans[i] = calc(i);
  while (cin >> N, N)
    cout << ans[N] << endl;
}
```

This optimized version of the program improves the efficiency by using a binary search in the `nr` function and avoids unnecessary calculations in the `calc` function.
