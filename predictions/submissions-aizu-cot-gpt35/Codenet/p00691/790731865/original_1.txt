Step 1: Avoid unnecessary calculations

In the `nr` function, we are iterating over all the elements in the `tb` array to find the largest element that is smaller than `a`. However, since the `tb` array is sorted in ascending order, we can use binary search to find the index of the largest element that is smaller than `a`. This will reduce the number of iterations required and improve the running time of the function.

Step 2: Precompute the values of `ret` in the `calc` function

In the `calc` function, we are computing the value of `ret` for each iteration of the loop. However, the value of `ret` is only dependent on `z` and does not change within the loop. Therefore, we can compute the value of `ret` once before the loop and reuse it in each iteration. This will eliminate unnecessary computations and improve the running time of the function.

Step 3: Avoid unnecessary calculations in the main loop

In the main loop, we are calling the `calc` function for each value of `i` from 1 to 1111. However, the `ans` array is pre-initialized with the values of `calc(i)` for each `i`. Therefore, we can directly access the pre-computed values from the `ans` array instead of calling the `calc` function. This will eliminate unnecessary function calls and improve the running time of the program.

Optimized program:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int tb[1112], ans[1112], N;
int nr(int a) {
  int low = 1, high = 1111, ret = 1;
  while (low <= high) {
    int mid = (low + high) / 2;
    if (tb[mid] <= a) {
      ret = mid;
      low = mid + 1;
    } else {
      high = mid - 1;
    }
  }
  return tb[ret];
}
int calc(int z) {
  int z3 = z * z * z;
  int ret = z3 - nr(z3 - 1) - 1;
  for (int i = 1; i < z; i++) {
    int i3 = i * i * i, j3 = nr(z3 - i3);
    if (i3 + j3 >= z3)
      break;
    ret = min(ret, z3 - i3 - j3);
  }
  return ret;
}
int main() {
  for (int i = 1; i < 1112; i++)
    tb[i] = i * i * i;
  for (int i = 1; i < 1112; i++)
    ans[i] = calc(i);
  while (cin >> N, N)
    cout << ans[N] << endl;
}
