The current program calculates the minimum value of `z3 - i3 - j3` for each `z` in the range [1, 1111]. The function `nr` is used to find the largest cube smaller than a given value.

To optimize the program, we can pre-calculate the values of `tb[i]` and store them in an array, rather than calculating them in the `nr` function every time. This will reduce the number of calculations and improve the running time.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

const int MAX_N = 1112;
int tb[MAX_N], ans[MAX_N], N;

int calc(int z) {
  int z3 = z * z * z, ret = z3;
  for (int i = 1; i < z; i++) {
    int i3 = i * i * i, j3 = tb[z3 - i3];
    if (i3 + j3 >= z3)
      break;
    ret = min(ret, z3 - i3 - j3);
  }
  return ret;
}

int main() {
  for (int i = 1; i < MAX_N; i++)
    tb[i] = i * i * i;
  for (int i = 1; i < MAX_N; i++)
    ans[i] = calc(i);
  while (cin >> N, N)
    cout << ans[N] << endl;
}
```

In the optimized program, we have removed the `nr` function and replaced the calculation of `j3` with a direct lookup in the `tb` array. This eliminates the loop in `nr` and reduces the number of calculations.

The overall logic of the program remains the same, but the optimized version should run faster and use less memory due to the pre-calculation of `tb` values.
