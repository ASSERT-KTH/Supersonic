The given program calculates the value of `z^3 - ans` for each input `z`. `ans` is calculated by finding the maximum value of `x^3 + y^3` such that `x^3 + y^3 <= z^3`. 

To optimize this program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary header files: The `cmath`, `map`, `set`, and `vector` header files are not used in the program. We can remove them.

2. Remove the unused `typedef`: The `typedef long long ll` is not used in the program. We can remove it.

3. Optimize the `b_pow` function: The `b_pow` function calculates `x^n` using the binary exponentiation algorithm. However, this function is not used in the program. We can remove it.

4. Optimize the nested loops: The nested loops iterate over `x` and `y` values to find the maximum value of `x^3 + y^3` such that `x^3 + y^3 <= z^3`. This can be optimized by using a single loop for `x` and calculating the maximum value of `y^3` inside that loop.

5. Avoid unnecessary multiplication: Instead of calculating `z^3` multiple times, we can calculate it once and store it in a variable.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int z;
  while (cin >> z && z) {
    int ans = 0;
    int zCube = z * z * z;
    for (int x = 1; x * x * x <= zCube; x++) {
      int maxyCube = zCube - x * x * x;
      int y = 1;
      while (y * y * y <= maxyCube) {
        ans = max(ans, x * x * x + y * y * y);
        y++;
      }
    }
    cout << zCube - ans << endl;
  }
}
```
