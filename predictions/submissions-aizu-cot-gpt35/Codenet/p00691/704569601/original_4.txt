This program calculates the difference between z^3 and the maximum value of x^3 + y^3 such that x^3 + y^3 is less than or equal to z^3.

To optimize this program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary header files: The <algorithm>, <cmath>, <map>, <set>, and <vector> header files are not used in the program, so we can remove them.

2. Remove unused typedef: The typedef for long long (ll) is not used in the program, so we can remove it.

3. Optimize the power function: The b_pow function uses a recursive approach to calculate the power of a number. We can optimize this function by using the std::pow function from the <cmath> library.

4. Optimize the nested loops: The nested loops iterate over x and y, calculating x^3 + y^3 and updating the maximum value. We can optimize this by using a single loop and calculating x^3 + y^3 directly.

5. Use a more descriptive variable name: The variable "z" is not very descriptive. We can change it to "input" to better represent its purpose.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>

int main() {
  int input;
  while (std::cin >> input && input) {
    int ans = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i * i * i <= input * input * input; i++) {
      int temp = input * input * input - i * i * i;
      if (temp < ans) {
        break;
      }
      ans = temp;
    }
    std::cout << ans << std::endl;
  }
}
```
