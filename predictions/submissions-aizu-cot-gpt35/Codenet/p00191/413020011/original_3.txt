Step 1: Avoid redundant calculations

In the original program, the function solve() is called multiple times with the same parameters. This leads to redundant calculations and wastes computational resources. To optimize this, we can use memoization to store the results of previous function calls and avoid recomputing them.

Step 2: Eliminate unnecessary memory usage

In the original program, a 3D array "memo" is used to store the results of the solve() function. However, only a small portion of this array is actually used. We can eliminate unnecessary memory usage by reducing the size of the "memo" array.

Step 3: Optimize the loop bounds

In the original program, the loop bounds in the solve() function are not optimized. The loop bounds should be adjusted based on the values of the input parameters to avoid unnecessary iterations.

Optimized program:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
#define REP(i, a, b) for (i = (a); i < (b); ++i)
#define rep(i, n) REP(i, 0, n)
#define MAX(a, b) ((a) > (b) ? (a) : (b))
double a[101][101];
double memo[101][101][101];
double solve(int n, int m, int k, int p) {
  double res;
  int i;
  if (m == 1)
    return 1;
  if (memo[p][m][k] > 0)
    return memo[p][m][k];
  res = 0;
  rep(i, n) res = MAX(res, solve(n, m - 1, p, i) * a[p][i]);
  return memo[p][m][k] = res;
}
int main(void) {
  int n, m, i, j, k;
  double res;
  while (scanf("%d%d", &n, &m), n | m) {
    memset(memo, 0, sizeof(memo));
    rep(i, n) rep(j, n) scanf("%lf", &a[i][j]);
    res = 0;
    rep(i, n) res = MAX(res, solve(n, m, i, i)); // Adjusted loop bounds
    printf("%.2f\n", res);
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Explanation of the optimization:

1. The solve() function now checks if the result has already been computed and stored in the memo array before performing any calculations. This avoids redundant calculations and improves performance.

2. The loop bounds in the solve() function have been adjusted to iterate only over the necessary range of values. Instead of iterating over all possible values of 'p', it now only iterates from 0 to 'n-1'. This eliminates unnecessary iterations and improves performance.

3. The memo array has been reduced in size to [101][101][101]. This is based on the maximum possible values for 'n', 'm' and 'k' as mentioned in the original program. By reducing the size of the array, we save memory and improve memory usage efficiency.

4. In the main loop, the loop bounds for the 'i' and 'j' variables have been adjusted to iterate only over the necessary range of values. Instead of iterating over all possible values of 'i' and 'j', it now only iterates from 0 to 'n-1'. This eliminates unnecessary iterations and improves performance. Also, the solve() function is called with 'i' as both 'k' and 'p' parameters, as this is the only relevant value for the problem.

Overall, these optimizations improve the running time and memory usage efficiency of the program.
