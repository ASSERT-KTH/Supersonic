The given program calculates the maximum product of probabilities in a matrix by recursively iterating through all possible paths. To optimize this program, we can use memoization to avoid redundant calculations.

Here is the step-by-step optimization:

1. Remove unnecessary macro definitions: The macro definitions `REP`, `rep`, and `MAX` are not necessary and can be replaced with their respective function calls.

2. Use a 2-dimensional array instead of a 3-dimensional array for memoization: The current implementation uses a 3-dimensional array `memo` to store the results of the recursive calls. However, since the value of `k` is not used, we can use a 2-dimensional array for memoization to save memory.

3. Initialize the memoization array with a special value: Instead of using `memset` to initialize the `memo` array with zeros, we can initialize it with a special value that represents an uninitialized state. This way, we can check if a value has been memoized by comparing it to this special value.

4. Optimize the recursive function: Instead of iterating over all possible values of `i` in each recursive call, we can pass the maximum value of `i` as a parameter to the `solve` function. This way, we can avoid unnecessary iterations and reduce the running time.

Here is the optimized program:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

#define MAX_N 101

double a[MAX_N][MAX_N];
double memo[MAX_N][MAX_N];
int max_i[MAX_N];

double solve(int n, int m, int p, int max_i_p) {
  if (m == 1)
    return 1;
  if (memo[p][m] > 0)
    return memo[p][m];
  double res = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < max_i_p; ++i)
    res = fmax(res, solve(n, m - 1, p, i) * a[p][i]);
  return memo[p][m] = res;
}

int main(void) {
  int n, m;
  while (scanf("%d%d", &n, &m), n | m) {
    memset(memo, 0, sizeof(memo));
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
      for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
        scanf("%lf", &a[i][j]);
      }
      max_i[i] = i; // Initialize max_i with the maximum possible value of i
    }
    double res = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
      res = fmax(res, solve(n, m, i, max_i[i]));
      for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
        if (a[i][j] > a[i][max_i[i]]) {
          max_i[i] = j; // Update max_i if a higher probability is found
        }
      }
    }
    printf("%.2f\n", res);
  }
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized program reduces the memory usage by using a 2-dimensional array for memoization and improves the running time by avoiding unnecessary iterations in the recursive function.
