Step 1: Remove unnecessary macros

The REP macro is not used in the program, so we can remove it.

Step 2: Optimize the solve function

Currently, the solve function uses recursion to solve the problem. However, this approach has exponential time complexity, which can be very inefficient for large inputs.

To optimize the solve function, we can use dynamic programming to avoid redundant calculations. We can create a 3-dimensional memoization table to store the results of subproblems. The dimensions of the table will be (n+1) x (m+1) x (n+1), where n is the number of nodes, m is the number of steps, and p is the current node.

By using the memoization table, we can avoid recalculating the same subproblem multiple times. Instead, we can look up the result in the table and return it if it exists. If it doesn't exist, we can calculate the result and store it in the table for future use.

Step 3: Optimize memory usage

The current implementation uses a 2-dimensional array 'a' of size 101 x 101 to store the edge weights between nodes. However, the actual input constraints are not specified, so it is unclear if such a large array is necessary.

To optimize memory usage, we can dynamically allocate the 'a' array based on the actual input size. We can use malloc() to allocate memory for the array at runtime.

Step 4: Optimize running time

The current implementation uses nested loops to iterate over the 'a' array and calculate the maximum result. However, this approach has a time complexity of O(n^2) for each step, resulting in a total time complexity of O(n^4) for the entire program.

To optimize running time, we can precalculate the maximum edge weight for each node and store it in a separate array. Then, during the calculation of the solve function, we can use this precalculated value instead of iterating over the 'a' array.

Step 5: Use a different data type for the memoization table

The current implementation uses a double data type for the memoization table. However, since the values being stored are either 0 or a positive floating-point number, we can use a boolean data type instead to save memory.

Here is the optimized program:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <stdbool.h>
#include <string.h>

double** a;
bool*** memo;
double* maxWeight;

double solve(int n, int m, int p) {
  double res;
  int i;
  if (m == 1)
    return 1;
  if (memo[p][m][n])
    return memo[p][m][n];
  res = 0;
  for (i = 0; i < n; ++i)
    res = fmax(res, solve(n, m - 1, i) * a[p][i]);
  return memo[p][m][n] = res;
}

int main(void) {
  int n, m, i, j;
  double res;
  while (scanf("%d%d", &n, &m), n | m) {
    a = (double**)malloc(n * sizeof(double*));
    for (i = 0; i < n; ++i)
      a[i] = (double*)malloc(n * sizeof(double));
    memo = (bool***)malloc(n * sizeof(bool**));
    for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
      memo[i] = (bool**)malloc((m + 1) * sizeof(bool*));
      for (j = 0; j <= m; ++j)
        memo[i][j] = (bool*)calloc(n + 1, sizeof(bool));
    }
    maxWeight = (double*)malloc(n * sizeof(double));
    for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
      maxWeight[i] = 0;
      for (j = 0; j < n; ++j)
        maxWeight[i] = fmax(maxWeight[i], a[i][j]);
    }
    for (i = 0; i < n; ++i)
      for (j = 0; j < n; ++j)
        scanf("%lf", &a[i][j]);
    res = 0;
    for (i = 0; i < n; ++i)
      for (j = 0; j < n; ++j)
        res = fmax(res, solve(n, m, i) * a[j][i]);
    printf("%.2f\n", res);
    for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
      free(a[i]);
      for (j = 0; j <= m; ++j)
        free(memo[i][j]);
      free(memo[i]);
    }
    free(a);
    for (i = 0; i < n; ++i)
      free(memo[i]);
    free(memo);
    free(maxWeight);
  }
  return 0;
}
```
