Step 1: Avoiding unnecessary calculations

The current implementation of the `solve` function calculates the maximum value for each combination of `n`, `m`, `p`, and `i` even if the result has already been calculated and stored in the `memo` array. 

To optimize this, we can modify the code to only calculate the maximum value if it has not been previously calculated. We can do this by checking if `memo[p][m][k]` is greater than 0 before proceeding with the calculations.

Step 2: Reducing unnecessary function calls

The current implementation of the `solve` function calls itself recursively for each combination of `n`, `m`, `p`, and `i`. This leads to a large number of unnecessary function calls.

We can optimize this by storing the maximum values for each combination of `n`, `m`, `p`, and `i` in the `memo` array as we calculate them. This way, we can avoid redundant function calls and directly retrieve the maximum values from the `memo` array.

Step 3: Avoiding unnecessary memory allocations

The current implementation uses a 2D array `a` to store the input values and a 3D array `memo` to store the maximum values. However, we only need to store the maximum values for each combination of `n`, `m`, and `p`.

We can optimize this by using a 2D array `memo` to store the maximum values. This way, we can reduce the memory usage by eliminating the need for the `a` array.

Step 4: Avoiding unnecessary loops and calculations

The current implementation uses nested loops to iterate over the values of `n`, `m`, `i`, and `j` in the `main` function. However, we only need to iterate over the values of `i` and `j` once to calculate the maximum value.

We can optimize this by removing the nested loops and calculating the maximum value directly in a single loop.

Step 5: Miscellaneous optimizations

- We can remove the unused variable `k` from the `main` function.
- We can remove the unused macro `MAX` since we can use the `fmax` function from the `math.h` library instead.

Here is the optimized version of the program:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <math.h>

#define REP(i, a, b) for (i = (a); i < (b); ++i)
#define rep(i, n) REP(i, 0, n)

double memo[101][101];
double solve(int n, int m, int p) {
  double res;
  int i;
  if (m == 1)
    return 1;
  if (memo[p][m] > 0)
    return memo[p][m];
  res = 0;
  rep(i, n) res = fmax(res, solve(n, m - 1, i) * memo[p][i]);
  return memo[p][m] = res;
}

int main(void) {
  int n, m, i, j;
  double res;
  while (scanf("%d%d", &n, &m), n | m) {
    memset(memo, 0, sizeof(memo));
    rep(i, n) rep(j, n) scanf("%lf", &memo[i][j]);
    res = 0;
    rep(i, n) res = fmax(res, solve(n, m, i));
    printf("%.2f\n", res);
  }
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized version reduces unnecessary calculations, function calls, and memory allocations to improve the running time and memory usage of the program.
