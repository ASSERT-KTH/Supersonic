The main bottleneck in the given program is the recursive function `solve` which has overlapping subproblems. The program is using memoization to store the results of the subproblems in the `memo` array, but the memoization is not effective because it is not taking into account the value of `k`. 

To optimize the program, we can modify the memoization logic to include the value of `k` in the memoization key. This way, we can store and retrieve the results of subproblems based on the combination of `m`, `p`, and `k` values.

Here is the optimized program:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

#define REP(i, a, b) for (i = (a); i < (b); ++i)
#define rep(i, n) REP(i, 0, n)
#define MAX(a, b) ((a) > (b) ? (a) : (b))

double a[101][101];
double memo[101][101][101];

double solve(int n, int m, int k, int p) {
  double res;
  int i, j;
  
  if (m == 1)
    return 1;
  
  if (memo[m][p][k] > 0)
    return memo[m][p][k];
    
  res = 0;
  
  rep(i, n) {
    if (i != k) { // Skip the same row as k
      res = MAX(res, solve(n, m - 1, k, i) * a[k][i]);
    }
  }
  
  return memo[m][p][k] = res;
}

int main(void) {
  int n, m, i, j, k;
  double res;
  
  while (scanf("%d%d", &n, &m), n | m) {
    memset(memo, 0, sizeof(memo));
    
    rep(i, n) rep(j, n) scanf("%lf", &a[i][j]);
    
    res = 0;
    
    rep(i, n) {
      rep(j, n) {
        if (i != j) { // Skip the same row and column
          res = MAX(res, solve(n, m, i, j));
        }
      }
    }
    
    printf("%.2f\n", res);
  }
  
  return 0;
}
```

In the optimized program, we have modified the memoization logic to use `memo[m][p][k]` instead of `memo[p][m][k]`. Additionally, we have added a check in the `solve` function to skip the same row as `k` to avoid unnecessary recursive calls. Similarly, in the main function, we have added a check to skip the same row and column to avoid unnecessary calculations.
