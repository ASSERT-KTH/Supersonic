Step 1: Remove unnecessary macros

The program includes two macros, `REP` and `rep`, which are used to define loops. However, these macros are not necessary and can be replaced with regular for-loops. This will improve the readability of the code.

Step 2: Improve array indexing

The program uses 2D arrays `a`, `memo`, and `solve` to store and manipulate data. However, the indexing of these arrays can be improved to reduce unnecessary calculations and memory access.

Step 3: Optimize recursion

The `solve` function uses recursion to calculate the maximum value. However, this recursive approach can be optimized by using dynamic programming. Instead of recalculating the same values multiple times, we can store the results in a memoization array and reuse them when needed.

Step 4: Optimize memory usage

The program uses a 3D memoization array `memo` to store intermediate results. However, this array is larger than necessary and can be reduced to a 2D array, as the `p` parameter is always equal to `k`.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

#define MAX(a, b) ((a) > (b) ? (a) : (b))

double a[101][101];
double memo[101][101];

double solve(int n, int m, int k) {
  double res = 0;
  
  if (m == 1)
    return 1;
  
  if (memo[m][k] > 0)
    return memo[m][k];
  
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    res = MAX(res, solve(n, m - 1, i) * a[k][i]);
  }
  
  return memo[m][k] = res;
}

int main(void) {
  int n, m;
  
  while (scanf("%d%d", &n, &m), n | m) {
    memset(memo, 0, sizeof(memo));
    
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
      for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
        scanf("%lf", &a[i][j]);
      }
    }
    
    double res = 0;
    
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
      res = MAX(res, solve(n, m, i));
    }
    
    printf("%.2f\n", res);
  }
  
  return 0;
}
```

Explanation of optimization steps:

Step 1: The unnecessary macros `REP` and `rep` were removed and replaced with regular for-loops. This improves code readability.

Step 2: The array indexing of `a`, `memo`, and `solve` was improved by using more meaningful loop variables (`i`, `j`, `k`, `m`).

Step 3: The recursive approach of the `solve` function was optimized using dynamic programming. The results are stored in a memoization array `memo` to avoid redundant calculations.

Step 4: The `memo` array was reduced to a 2D array since the `p` parameter is always equal to `k`. This reduces the memory usage of the program.
