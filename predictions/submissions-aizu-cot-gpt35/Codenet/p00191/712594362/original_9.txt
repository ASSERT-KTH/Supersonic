The given program is using a naive recursive approach to solve a dynamic programming problem. It calculates the probability of a sequence of events happening over a given number of times.

To optimize the program, we can use memoization to avoid redundant calculations. Memoization is a technique where we store the results of expensive function calls and return the cached result when the same inputs occur again.

Here are the steps to optimize the program:

1. Remove unnecessary headers: The program includes unnecessary headers such as `<algorithm>` and `<cmath>`. We can remove them since they are not used in the program.

2. Use `std::vector` instead of C-style array: Instead of using C-style arrays `dp[101][101]` and `t[101][101]`, we can use `std::vector` to dynamically allocate memory. This will allow us to handle any input size without worrying about fixed array sizes.

3. Use `std::vector` to initialize `dp` array: Instead of using `fill()` function to initialize `dp` array, we can use `std::vector` constructor to set all elements to -1.

4. Use `std::vector` to read input values: Instead of using nested loops to read input values into `t` array, we can use `std::vector` and `std::cin` to read the values directly into the vector.

5. Use integer arithmetic instead of floating-point arithmetic: Since the result is expected to be printed with only two decimal places, we can use integer arithmetic to avoid the overhead of floating-point calculations.

6. Remove unnecessary variables: The variables `ret` and `retd` are not used and can be removed.

7. Use a bottom-up approach instead of a top-down approach: Instead of using a recursive function, we can use a bottom-up approach to calculate the probabilities iteratively. This will avoid the overhead of function calls and recursion.

Here is the optimized C++ program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

int main() {
  int n, m;
  while (std::cin >> n >> m) {
    if (n == 0 && m == 0)
      break;

    std::vector<std::vector<double>> t(n, std::vector<double>(n));
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
        std::cin >> t[i][j];
      }
    }

    std::vector<std::vector<double>> dp(m + 1, std::vector<double>(n, -1.0));
    dp[m][0] = 1.0;

    for (int times = m - 1; times >= 0; times--) {
      for (int prev = 0; prev < n; prev++) {
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
          if (times == 0) {
            dp[times][prev] = std::max(dp[times][prev], dp[times + 1][i]);
          } else {
            dp[times][prev] = std::max(dp[times][prev], dp[times + 1][i] * t[prev][i]);
          }
        }
      }
    }

    int result = static_cast<int>(dp[0][0] * 100);
    std::cout << result / 100 << "." << result % 100 << std::endl;
  }

  return 0;
}
```

This optimized program uses a bottom-up approach to calculate the probabilities iteratively. It initializes the `dp` array with -1, reads the input values directly into the `t` vector, and calculates the probabilities using nested loops. The result is then printed with two decimal places using integer arithmetic.
