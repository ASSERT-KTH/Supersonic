This program calculates the maximum probability of a sequence of events occurring. It uses dynamic programming to store the calculated probabilities in the dp array to avoid redundant calculations.

To optimize this program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary headers: The program includes `<algorithm>`, `<cmath>`, and `<cstdio>`, which are not used in the program. We can remove them to reduce unnecessary overhead.

2. Avoid using `using namespace std;`: The program currently uses `using namespace std;` which can lead to naming conflicts. It's better to avoid using this statement and prefix the standard library functions and types with `std::` to prevent any potential conflicts.

3. Use a more appropriate data type for the dp array: The current implementation uses a double data type for the dp array, but the values stored in the array are either -1 or probabilities. Using a double for storing -1 is unnecessary and wastes memory. We can use an integer data type instead.

4. Use a more appropriate data type for the tmp variable: The tmp variable is used to store intermediate maximum values. Using a double for this variable is unnecessary, as the maximum values are probabilities. We can use a variable of the same type as the probabilities in the t array.

5. Use a more appropriate loop condition: The loop condition `times == m` can be replaced with `times >= m` since the maximum probability is already calculated at `times == m` and it won't change for `times > m`.

6. Avoid unnecessary multiplication with 1: In the loop, there is a multiplication by 1, which is unnecessary. We can remove it to improve the performance slightly.

7. Use a more appropriate loop condition for filling the dp array: The current implementation uses `fill` function with the size of `(double *)dp + 101 * 101`. We can replace it with a loop that iterates over the dp array indexes to fill it with -1.

With these modifications, the optimized program is as follows:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

const int MAX_N = 101;
int n, m;
int dp[MAX_N][MAX_N];
double t[MAX_N][MAX_N];

double solve(int times, int prev) {
  if (dp[times][prev] != -1)
    return dp[times][prev];
  if (times >= m)
    return dp[times][prev] = 1;

  int tmp = -1;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    if (times == 0) {
      tmp = std::max(tmp, solve(times + 1, i));
    } else {
      tmp = std::max(tmp, solve(times + 1, i) * t[prev][i]);
    }
  }
  return dp[times][prev] = tmp;
}

int main() {
  while (std::cin >> n >> m) {
    if (!(n | m))
      break;

    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
        std::cin >> t[i][j];
      }
    }

    for (int i = 0; i < MAX_N; i++) {
      for (int j = 0; j < MAX_N; j++) {
        dp[i][j] = -1;
      }
    }

    double retd = solve(0, 0) * 100;
    printf("%.2lf\n", round(retd) / 100);
  }
  return 0;
}
