The given program calculates the maximum probability of a sequence of events occurring. It uses a dynamic programming approach to solve the problem. However, there are a few optimizations that can be made to improve the program's running time and memory usage.

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The program includes unnecessary header files such as <algorithm> and <cmath>. Since these headers are not used in the program, they can be removed.

2. Remove unnecessary namespace: The program uses the "using namespace std;" statement, which is considered bad practice. We can remove it and prefix the standard library functions and types with "std::" where needed.

3. Use a constant for array size: The program uses the constant value 101 for the size of the dp and t arrays. We can define a constant variable to represent this size and use it instead of the hardcoded value.

4. Use a 2D array instead of a dynamically sized array: The program uses a dynamically sized array (t) for storing the input values. We can use a fixed-size 2D array instead, which can improve memory efficiency.

5. Optimize the solve function: The solve function can be optimized by removing unnecessary checks and calculations. We can avoid recalculating the same values by storing them in the dp array. Additionally, we can use a bottom-up approach instead of recursion to improve performance.

6. Avoid using floating-point arithmetic: The program uses floating-point arithmetic to calculate the final result. Floating-point arithmetic can introduce rounding errors. We can avoid this by using integer arithmetic and multiplying the result by 100 at the end.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <cstdio>
#include <iostream>

const int MAX_N = 101;

int n, m;
int t[MAX_N][MAX_N];
int dp[MAX_N][MAX_N];

int solve() {
  for (int times = 0; times <= m; times++) {
    for (int prev = 0; prev < n; prev++) {
      if (times == 0) {
        dp[times][prev] = 1;
      } else {
        int tmp = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
          tmp = std::max(tmp, dp[times - 1][i] * t[i][prev]);
        }
        dp[times][prev] = tmp;
      }
    }
  }
  return dp[m][0];
}

int main(void) {
  while (std::cin >> n >> m) {
    if (!(n | m))
      break;

    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
        std::cin >> t[i][j];
      }
    }

    int result = solve() * 100;
    std::printf("%.2lf\n", result / 100.0);
  }
}
```
