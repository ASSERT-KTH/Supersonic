This program calculates the maximum probability of a sequence of events occurring, given a transition matrix. The program uses dynamic programming to memoize the results and avoid redundant calculations.

Here are the steps to optimize the program:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The program includes unnecessary headers like `<algorithm>` and `<cmath>`. Since they are not used in the program, we can remove them.

2. Avoid using `using namespace std;`: The program uses `using namespace std;` which is generally considered bad practice. We should avoid using this statement and instead prefix the standard library functions and types with `std::`.

3. Optimize the `solve` function: The `solve` function is the main bottleneck in this program. It uses recursion and memoization to calculate the maximum probability. However, the recursion can be replaced with a loop to avoid the overhead of function calls. Additionally, we can optimize the `tmp` variable initialization and calculation of the maximum probability. Instead of initializing `tmp` with `-1` and then comparing it with the updated value, we can directly initialize it with `0` and update it if the new value is greater.

4. Use the `memset` function to initialize the `dp` array: Instead of using `fill` to initialize the `dp` array, we can use the `memset` function which is generally faster for large arrays.

5. Use `std::fixed` and `std::setprecision` to format the output: Instead of using `printf` to format the output, we can use the `std::fixed` and `std::setprecision` functions from the `<iomanip>` header to achieve the same result.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <iomanip>
#include <cstring>

const int MAX_N = 101;

int n, m;
double dp[MAX_N][MAX_N];
double t[MAX_N][MAX_N];

double solve() {
  memset(dp, 0, sizeof(dp));

  for (int times = m; times >= 0; times--) {
    for (int prev = 0; prev < n; prev++) {
      if (times == m) {
        dp[times][prev] = 1;
      } else {
        double tmp = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
          tmp = std::max(tmp, dp[times + 1][i] * t[prev][i]);
        }
        dp[times][prev] = tmp;
      }
    }
  }

  return dp[0][0];
}

int main() {
  while (std::cin >> n >> m && (n || m)) {
    memset(t, 0, sizeof(t));

    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
        std::cin >> t[i][j];
      }
    }

    double result = solve() * 100;
    std::cout << std::fixed << std::setprecision(2) << round(result) / 100 << std::endl;
  }

  return 0;
}
```

This optimized program eliminates unnecessary includes, avoids using `using namespace std;`, replaces recursion with a loop in the `solve` function, uses `memset` to initialize the `dp` and `t` arrays, and uses `std::fixed` and `std::setprecision` to format the output. These optimizations should improve the running time and memory usage of the program.
