The given program calculates the maximum probability of a certain event happening after a certain number of trials. The program uses dynamic programming to memoize the results and avoid recomputing the same subproblems.

To optimize the program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Use a 2D array of bools instead of doubles for `dp` array: Since we are only storing a boolean value (whether the result has been computed or not), using a bool array will consume less memory compared to a double array.

2. Use a 2D array of floats instead of doubles for `t` array: The given program uses a double array to store the transition probabilities. However, the problem statement mentions that the probabilities are given as percentages, which are typically represented using float data type. Using floats instead of doubles will reduce memory usage without sacrificing precision significantly.

3. Optimize the `solve` function:
   - Instead of checking `if (dp[times][prev] != -1)` to see if the result has been computed, we can initialize the `dp` array with `0` instead of `-1`. This will allow us to directly check if the result is non-zero to determine if it has been computed or not.
   - Instead of using `max` function to find the maximum probability, we can use the `std::max` function from the `<algorithm>` header. This will improve readability and maintainability of the code.

After applying these optimizations, the optimized program will look like this:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <cmath>
#include <cstdio>
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int n, m;
bool dp[101][101];
float t[101][101];

float solve(int times, int prev) {
  if (dp[times][prev])
    return dp[times][prev];
  if (times == m)
    return dp[times][prev] = true;
  float tmp = 0.0;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    if (times == 0) {
      tmp = std::max(tmp, solve(times + 1, i) * 1.0);
    } else {
      tmp = std::max(tmp, solve(times + 1, i) * t[prev][i]);
    }
  }
  return dp[times][prev] = tmp;
}

int main(void) {
  while (cin >> n >> m) {
    if (!(n | m))
      break;
    std::fill_n((bool *)dp, 101 * 101, false);
    int ret;
    float retd;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
        cin >> t[i][j];
      }
    }
    retd = solve(0, 0) * 100;
    printf("%.2f\n", round(retd) / 100);
  }
}
```
