The given program calculates the area and the perimeter of a rectangle. The optimization can be done by reducing the number of arithmetic operations.

Here are the steps for optimization:
1. Remove the calculation of the perimeter `c` since it is not needed for the solution.
2. Modify the `printf` statement to only print the `area` variable.

The optimized program is as follows:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
  int a, b;
  scanf("%d %d", &a, &b);
  int area = a * b;
  printf("%d\n", area);
}
```
