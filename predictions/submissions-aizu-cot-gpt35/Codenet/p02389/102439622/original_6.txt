Step 1: Remove unnecessary variables
- The variable `area` is unnecessary since it is only used once to print its value. We can directly print `a * b`.
- The variable `c` is unnecessary since it is only used once to print its value. We can directly print `a * 2 + b * 2`.
- By removing these unnecessary variables, we can reduce memory usage.

Optimized program:
```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
  int a, b;
  scanf("%d %d", &a, &b);
  printf("%d %d\n", a * b, a * 2 + b * 2);
}
```
