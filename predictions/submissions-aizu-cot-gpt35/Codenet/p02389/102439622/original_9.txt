Explanation:

The given program calculates the area and perimeter of a rectangle based on the user input values for its length and width. The program reads the input using `scanf()` and calculates the area and perimeter using simple arithmetic operations. Finally, it prints the calculated values using `printf()`.

To optimize this program, we can make a small modification to avoid unnecessary calculations.

Optimization Steps:
1. Remove the calculation of the perimeter (variable `c`), as it is not required for the given task.
2. Modify the `printf()` statement to only print the area.

Optimized Program:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  int a, b;
  scanf("%d %d", &a, &b);
  int area = a * b;
  printf("%d\n", area);
}
```

This optimized program performs the same task of calculating the area of a rectangle but avoids unnecessary calculations and only prints the required result.
