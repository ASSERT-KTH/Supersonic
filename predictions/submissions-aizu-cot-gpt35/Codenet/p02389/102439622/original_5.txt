Step 1: Remove unnecessary variable declaration and initialization.
- The variable `area` can be directly printed without storing it in a separate variable.

Step 2: Combine the calculation and printing of `c` with the existing `printf` statement.
- Instead of calculating the value of `c` and then printing it separately, we can include it in the existing `printf` statement.

Step 3: Optimize input/output operations.
- Replace the `scanf` and `printf` functions with faster alternatives like `scanf_s` and `printf_s`.

Here is the optimized program:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  int a, b;
  scanf_s("%d %d", &a, &b);
  
  int c = a * 2 + b * 2;
  printf_s("%d %d\n", a * b, c);
}
```
