Step 1: Remove unnecessary variable

The variable `area` is not used anywhere else in the program. We can remove it and directly print the result of `a * b` in the `printf` statement.

Step 2: Simplify the calculation of `c`

Instead of calculating `a * 2 + b * 2`, we can simplify it to `(a + b) * 2`.

Step 3: Optimize input/output operations

Instead of using `scanf` and `printf` for input and output, we can use the more efficient `scanf_s` and `printf_s` functions.

Here is the optimized program:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  int a, b;
  scanf_s("%d %d", &a, &b);
  printf_s("%d %d\n", a * b, (a + b) * 2);
}
```
