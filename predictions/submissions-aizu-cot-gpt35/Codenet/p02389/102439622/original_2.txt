To optimize the given C program, we can make the following changes:

1. Remove unnecessary variable declarations: The variables `area` and `c` can be declared directly in the `printf` statement instead of being assigned separately.

2. Use a more efficient formula to calculate the perimeter: Instead of calculating the perimeter using `c = a * 2 + b * 2`, we can simplify it to `c = 2 * (a + b)`.

3. Eliminate redundant calculations: Since both `area` and `c` depend on the values of `a` and `b`, we can calculate them directly in the `printf` statement without assigning them to separate variables.

Here is the optimized version of the program:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  int a, b;
  scanf("%d %d", &a, &b);
  printf("%d %d\n", a * b, 2 * (a + b));
}
```
