The given program seems to be quite optimized already. However, we can make a small modification to improve its efficiency.

Currently, the program reads the input values for `a` and `b` using the `scanf` function. However, `scanf` can be slow and error-prone. We can use the `fgets` function to read the input as a string and then convert it to integers using the `sscanf` function.

Here is the optimized program:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
  char input[255];
  fgets(input, sizeof(input), stdin);
  int a, b;
  sscanf(input, "%d %d", &a, &b);

  int area = a * b;
  int c = a * 2 + b * 2;
  printf("%d %d\n", area, c);
}
```

In this optimized version, we use the `fgets` function to read the input as a string and store it in the `input` character array. We specify the maximum length of the input as 255 characters. Then, we use the `sscanf` function to extract the integers from the input string and store them in `a` and `b`.

By using `fgets` and `sscanf` instead of `scanf`, we can improve the program's efficiency and make it more robust against input errors.
