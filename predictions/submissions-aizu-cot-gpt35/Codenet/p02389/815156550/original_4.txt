The given program reads two integers from the user, multiplies them, and then prints the product followed by the sum of the two integers.

To optimize this program, we can eliminate the need for separate multiplication operations by calculating the product and sum simultaneously.

Here's the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    int a, b;
    std::cin >> a >> b;
    int product = a * b;
    int sum = a + b;
    std::cout << product << " " << sum * 2 << std::endl;
}
```

Explanation of optimization:
1. We declare two integer variables, `product` and `sum`, to store the calculated values.
2. Instead of multiplying `a` and `b` twice, we calculate the product once and store it in the `product` variable.
3. We calculate the sum of `a` and `b` and store it in the `sum` variable.
4. Finally, we print the `product` and the double of the `sum` in a single `cout` statement.
