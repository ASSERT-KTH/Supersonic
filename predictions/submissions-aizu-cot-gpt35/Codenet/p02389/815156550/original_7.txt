The given program reads two integer inputs from the user and calculates the product of the two numbers and the sum of their double values. The output is then printed to the console.

To optimize this program, we can eliminate the unnecessary variable `a` and directly calculate the required values using only `b`. This will result in a slight improvement in both running time and memory usage.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  int b;
  std::cin >> b;
  std::cout << b * b << " " << b * 6 << std::endl;
}
```
