The given program takes two integers as input, multiplies them, and then calculates the sum of the two numbers multiplied by 2. The result is then printed to the console.

To optimize this program, we can remove the unnecessary calculations and reduce the number of operations being performed.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  int a, b;
  std::cin >> a >> b;

  int product = a * b;
  int sum = a + b;

  std::cout << product << " " << sum * 2 << std::endl;
}
```

In the optimized program, we calculate the product of `a` and `b` only once and store it in a variable called `product`. Similarly, we calculate the sum of `a` and `b` only once and store it in a variable called `sum`. Finally, we print the `product` and the double of `sum` to the console. This reduces the number of multiplications and additions performed in the program, leading to improved performance.
