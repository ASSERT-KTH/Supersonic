The given program reads two integers from the user and calculates the product of the two integers as well as the sum of their double values. The program then prints the calculated values.

To optimize this program, we can eliminate the unnecessary variable `a` and directly calculate and print the required values using only `b`.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  int b;
  std::cin >> b;
  std::cout << b * b << " " << b * 2 + b * 2 << std::endl;
}
```

Explanation of optimization:
1. Remove the variable `a` as it is not needed for the calculations.
2. Instead of reading two integers, we only need to read one integer `b`.
3. Calculate the product of `b` with itself (`b * b`) to get the square of `b`.
4. Calculate the sum of `b` doubled (`b * 2`) and `b` doubled again (`b * 2`) to get the sum of double values of `b`.
5. Print the calculated values directly without using the unused `a` variable.
