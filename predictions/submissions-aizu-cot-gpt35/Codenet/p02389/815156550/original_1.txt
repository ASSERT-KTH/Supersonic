Explanation of optimization steps:

1. Avoid unnecessary variable declarations: The variables `a` and `b` are declared separately, but they can be declared in a single line to reduce code size.

2. Avoid unnecessary iostream usage: Instead of including the entire iostream library, we can include only the necessary headers `iostream` and `ostream` to reduce compilation time and memory usage.

3. Avoid repeated calculation: The expression `a * b` is calculated twice. We can calculate it once and store it in a variable for reuse.

4. Avoid repeated multiplication: The expressions `a * 2` and `b * 2` are calculated separately. We can calculate them once and store them in variables for reuse.

Optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <ostream>

int main() {
  int a, b;
  std::cin >> a >> b;
  
  int product = a * b;
  int sum = a * 2 + b * 2;
  
  std::cout << product << " " << sum << std::endl;
}
```
