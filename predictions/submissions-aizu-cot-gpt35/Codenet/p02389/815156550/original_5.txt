Step 1: Remove unnecessary variable declarations and assignments.

The variables `a` and `b` are declared and assigned values, but they are not used anywhere else in the program. We can remove these declarations and assignments to optimize the program.

Step 2: Combine the calculations into a single statement.

The program calculates `a * b` and `a * 2 + b * 2` separately. We can combine these calculations into a single statement to optimize the program.

Step 3: Remove unnecessary input/output operations.

The program takes input values for `a` and `b` using `std::cin`, but it does not use these values in any calculations. Similarly, the program outputs the results using `std::cout`, but it does not use these results anywhere else. We can remove these input/output operations to optimize the program.

Optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  int a, b;
  
  int result1 = a * b;
  int result2 = a * 2 + b * 2;
  
  return 0;
}
```
