Explanation of the optimization steps:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The program only uses `iostream`, so we can remove the unused `iostream` include.

2. Avoid redundant calculations: The original program calculates `a * 2` and `b * 2` separately. We can optimize this by calculating `a * 2 + b * 2` only once and storing it in a variable.

3. Optimize memory usage: The original program declares `int a` and `int b` separately. We can optimize memory usage by declaring them as a single line, `int a, b;`.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  int a, b;
  std::cin >> a >> b;
  int perimeter = a * 2 + b * 2;
  std::cout << a * b << " " << perimeter << std::endl;
}
```
