To optimize the given C++ program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary header file inclusion: The `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` header includes a large number of standard C++ library headers. However, the program does not use all of these headers. We can remove this line and include only the necessary headers.

2. Avoid unnecessary map usage: The program uses a `map` to store objects based on their y-coordinate. However, the y-coordinates are integers and are in a limited range. Instead of using a `map`, we can use a vector of vectors to store the objects directly based on their y-coordinate index. This will eliminate the need for the `map` and improve performance.

3. Avoid unnecessary matrix multiplications: The program uses matrix multiplication to calculate the result. However, some of these multiplications are unnecessary. We can remove the unnecessary matrix multiplications by calculating the required matrix powers directly.

4. Avoid unnecessary calculations: The program performs unnecessary calculations when the value of `Y - ny` or `h - 1 - ny` is 0. We can avoid these calculations by adding a simple check.

Here is the optimized C++ program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;
using ll = long long;

const ll mod = 1000000009;

using vl = vector<ll>;
using mat = vector<vl>;

mat mul(const mat &A, const mat &B) {
  int n = A.size();
  mat C(n, vl(n));
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
      for (int k = 0; k < n; ++k) {
        C[i][j] = (C[i][j] + A[i][k] * B[k][j]) % mod;
      }
    }
  }
  return C;
}

mat mat_pow(const mat &A, ll x) {
  int n = A.size();
  mat ret(n, vl(n, 0));
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    ret[i][i] = 1;
  }
  mat P(A);
  while (x) {
    if (x & 1) {
      ret = mul(ret, P);
    }
    P = mul(P, P);
    x >>= 1;
  }
  return ret;
}

vl mul(const mat &A, const vl &b) {
  int n = A.size();
  vl ret(n, 0);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
      ret[i] = (ret[i] + A[i][j] * b[j]) % mod;
    }
  }
  return ret;
}

int main() {
  int T = 1;
  int w, n;
  ll h;
  while (cin >> w >> h >> n, w) {
    vector<vector<int>> obj(h, vector<int>());
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
      ll x, y;
      cin >> x >> y;
      --x;
      --y;
      if (y > 0) {
        obj[y].push_back(x);
      }
    }
    mat O(w, vl(w, 0));
    for (int i = 0; i < w; ++i) {
      for (int j = -1; j <= 1; ++j) {
        if (0 <= i + j && i + j < w) {
          O[i][i + j] = 1;
        }
      }
    }
    mat A(w, vl(w, 0));
    for (int i = 0; i < w; ++i) {
      A[i][i] = 1;
    }
    ll ny = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < h; ++i) {
      if (obj[i].size() > 0) {
        ll Y = i;
        if (Y - ny > 1) {
          A = mul(mat_pow(O, Y - ny - 1), A);
        }
        mat B(O);
        for (int j : obj[i]) {
          for (int k = -1; k <= 1; ++k) {
            if (0 <= j + k && j + k < w) {
              B[j][j + k] = 0;
            }
          }
        }
        A = mul(B, A);
        ny = Y;
      }
    }
    if (ny != h - 1) {
      A = mul(mat_pow(O, h - 1 - ny), A);
    }
    vl b(w, 0);
    b[0] = 1;
    vl res = mul(A, b);
    ll ans = res[w - 1];
    printf("Case %d: %lld\n", T++, ans);
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Explanation of the optimizations:

1. Removed unnecessary header file inclusion: The `bits/stdc++.h` header includes a large number of standard C++ library headers. However, the program does not use all of these headers. By removing this line and including only the necessary headers, we can reduce the compilation time and improve the program's performance.

2. Avoided unnecessary map usage: The program uses a `map` to store objects based on their y-coordinate. However, the y-coordinates are integers and are in a limited range. Instead of using a `map`, we can use a vector of vectors to store the objects directly based on their y-coordinate index. This eliminates the need for the `map` and improves performance by reducing the overhead of map operations.

3. Avoided unnecessary matrix multiplications: The program uses matrix multiplication to calculate the result. However, some of these multiplications are unnecessary. By calculating the required matrix powers directly, we can avoid unnecessary multiplications and improve the program's performance.

4. Avoided unnecessary calculations: The program performs unnecessary calculations when the value of `Y - ny` or `h - 1 - ny` is 0. By adding a simple check to skip these calculations, we can improve the program's performance by reducing unnecessary operations.
