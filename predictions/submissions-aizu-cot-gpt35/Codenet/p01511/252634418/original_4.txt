Step 1: Remove unnecessary includes
- The program includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header, which includes all the standard library headers. This is not necessary and can slow down the compilation process. We should only include the necessary headers.

Step 2: Avoid using the `using namespace std` directive
- The program uses the `using namespace std` directive, which imports all the names from the `std` namespace into the global namespace. This can lead to naming conflicts and make the code harder to read. It's better to explicitly specify the namespace for each name that is used from the `std` namespace.

Step 3: Avoid using macros for loop constructs
- The program uses the `rep` macro to define a loop construct. Macros can be error-prone and are not type-safe. It's better to use a regular loop construct like `for` to iterate over a range.

Step 4: Optimize the matrix multiplication function
- The program uses a nested loop to perform matrix multiplication. This can be slow for large matrices. We can optimize it by using a more efficient algorithm, such as Strassen's algorithm or the Coppersmith-Winograd algorithm.

Step 5: Optimize the matrix exponentiation function
- The program uses a naive algorithm to perform matrix exponentiation. This can be slow for large exponents. We can optimize it by using a more efficient algorithm, such as the binary exponentiation algorithm or the repeated squaring algorithm.

Step 6: Optimize the matrix-vector multiplication function
- The program uses a nested loop to perform matrix-vector multiplication. This can be slow for large matrices. We can optimize it by using a more efficient algorithm, such as the Strassen algorithm or the Coppersmith-Winograd algorithm.

Step 7: Optimize the construction of the matrix 'O'
- The program uses a nested loop to construct the matrix 'O'. This can be slow for large matrices. We can optimize it by using a more efficient algorithm, such as using the `fill` function to set the main diagonal and the adjacent elements.

Step 8: Optimize the construction of the matrix 'A'
- The program uses a nested loop to construct the matrix 'A'. This can be slow for large matrices. We can optimize it by using a more efficient algorithm, such as using the `fill` function to set the main diagonal.

Step 9: Optimize the construction of the matrix 'B'
- The program uses a nested loop to construct the matrix 'B'. This can be slow for large matrices. We can optimize it by using a more efficient algorithm, such as using the `fill` function to set the main diagonal and the adjacent elements.

Step 10: Optimize the multiplication of matrices 'A' and 'B'
- The program uses a nested loop to multiply matrices 'A' and 'B'. This can be slow for large matrices. We can optimize it by using a more efficient algorithm, such as the Strassen algorithm or the Coppersmith-Winograd algorithm.

Step 11: Optimize the multiplication of matrix 'B' and vector 'b'
- The program uses a nested loop to multiply matrix 'B' and vector 'b'. This can be slow for large matrices. We can optimize it by using a more efficient algorithm, such as the Strassen algorithm or the Coppersmith-Winograd algorithm.
