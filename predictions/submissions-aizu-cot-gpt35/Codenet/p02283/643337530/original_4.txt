The given program is a basic implementation of a binary search tree. To optimize the program for running time and memory usage, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The program includes the `<cstdlib>` and `<string>` headers, but they are not used. We can remove them to improve compilation time.

2. Remove unnecessary `using namespace std;`: The program has a global `using namespace std;` statement. It is considered a good practice to avoid using the entire namespace in global scope. We can remove it and use the `std::` prefix where needed.

3. Use `nullptr` instead of `NIL`: The program uses a global `NIL` pointer to represent a null node in the binary search tree. Instead of using a separate pointer, we can use the `nullptr` keyword, which is more idiomatic in modern C++.

4. Use `new` instead of `malloc`: The program uses `malloc` to allocate memory for a new node in the binary search tree. It is recommended to use `new` instead, as it is more consistent with C++ memory management and allows for automatic destruction of objects.

5. Use pass-by-reference for node pointers: The functions `inorder` and `preorder` currently take the root node pointer by value. To avoid unnecessary copying, we can modify them to take the root node pointer by reference.

6. Use `std::cout` instead of `printf`: The program currently uses `printf` for printing the tree nodes. We can use `std::cout` instead, which is more idiomatic in C++.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <cstdio>
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

struct Node {
  int key;
  Node* right;
  Node* left;
  Node* parent;
};

Node* root = nullptr;

void insert(int k) {
  Node* y = nullptr;
  Node* x = root;
  Node* z = new Node();
  z->key = k;
  z->left = nullptr;
  z->right = nullptr;

  while (x != nullptr) {
    y = x;
    if (z->key < x->key) {
      x = x->left;
    } else {
      x = x->right;
    }
  }

  z->parent = y;
  if (y == nullptr) {
    root = z;
  } else {
    if (z->key < y->key) {
      y->left = z;
    } else {
      y->right = z;
    }
  }
}

void inorder(Node*& u) {
  if (u == nullptr) {
    return;
  }
  inorder(u->left);
  std::cout << " " << u->key;
  inorder(u->right);
}

void preorder(Node*& u) {
  if (u == nullptr) {
    return;
  }
  std::cout << " " << u->key;
  preorder(u->left);
  preorder(u->right);
}

int main() {
  int n, i, x;
  std::string com;
  std::scanf("%d", &n);

  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    std::cin >> com;
    if (com == "insert") {
      std::scanf("%d", &x);
      insert(x);
    } else if (com == "print") {
      inorder(root);
      std::cout << std::endl;
      preorder(root);
      std::cout << std::endl;
    }
  }

  return 0;
}
```

These modifications optimize the program for running time and memory usage without changing its overall functionality.
