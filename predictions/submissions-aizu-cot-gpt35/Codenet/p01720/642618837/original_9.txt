Step 1: Remove unnecessary includes
The program includes unnecessary headers, such as `<functional>` and `<iostream>`. Since we are not using any functionality from these headers, we can safely remove them.

Step 2: Remove unnecessary macros
The program defines a macro `INF` but it is not used anywhere. We can remove this macro.

Step 3: Optimize input reading
The program uses `scanf` for input reading. `scanf` is known to be slower than `cin` or `getline` for input reading in C++. We can replace `scanf` with `cin` for faster input reading.

Step 4: Optimize output writing
The program uses `printf` for output writing. `printf` is slower than `cout` for output writing in C++. We can replace `printf` with `cout` for faster output writing.

Step 5: Optimize the BFS algorithm
The program uses a BFS algorithm to find the shortest paths from the source node `s` and target node `t` to all other nodes. However, the BFS algorithm is implemented using a queue, which has a time complexity of O(N) for each iteration. We can optimize this by using a deque instead of a queue. A deque allows us to push elements from both ends, which can reduce the time complexity to O(1) for each iteration.

Step 6: Optimize memory usage
The program uses two vectors `d1` and `d2` to store the distances from the source node `s` and target node `t` to all other nodes. However, these vectors are initialized with a very large value `INF` (1 << 23). Since the maximum number of nodes `N` is given as an input, we can initialize these vectors with a value greater than `N` to save memory.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <deque>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int N, M, s, t, u, v;
  cin >> N >> M >> s >> t;
  s--;
  t--;
  vector<vector<int>> G(N);
  for (int i = 0; i < M; i++) {
    cin >> u >> v;
    G[u - 1].push_back(v - 1);
    G[v - 1].push_back(u - 1);
  }
  
  vector<int> d1(N, N + 1);
  d1[s] = 0;
  vector<int> d2(N, N + 1);
  d2[t] = 0;
  
  deque<int> que;
  que.push_back(s);
  while (!que.empty()) {
    int node = que.front();
    que.pop_front();
    for (int i = 0; i < G[node].size(); i++) {
      if (d1[G[node][i]] == N + 1) {
        d1[G[node][i]] = d1[node] + 1;
        que.push_back(G[node][i]);
      }
    }
  }
  
  que.push_back(t);
  while (!que.empty()) {
    int node = que.front();
    que.pop_front();
    for (int i = 0; i < G[node].size(); i++) {
      if (d2[G[node][i]] == N + 1) {
        d2[G[node][i]] = d2[node] + 1;
        que.push_back(G[node][i]);
      }
    }
  }
  
  int shortest = d1[t];
  vector<int> r1(shortest - 1, 0);
  for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
    if (d1[i] < shortest - 1) {
      r1[d1[i]]++;
    }
  }
  
  vector<int> r2(shortest - 1, 0);
  for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
    if (d2[i] < shortest - 1) {
      r2[d2[i]]++;
    }
  }
  
  long long ret = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < shortest - 1; i++) {
    ret += 1LL * r1[i] * r2[shortest - i - 2];
  }
  
  cout << ret << endl;
  return 0;
}
```

Explanation of optimization steps:

Step 1: Removed unnecessary includes.

Step 2: Removed the `INF` macro.

Step 3: Replaced `scanf` with `cin` for faster input reading.

Step 4: Replaced `printf` with `cout` for faster output writing.

Step 5: Replaced the queue with a deque for faster BFS algorithm.

Step 6: Initialized the distance vectors `d1` and `d2` with a value greater than `N` to save memory.
