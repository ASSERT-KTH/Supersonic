The given program calculates the number of shortest paths of length `shortest - 1` between two nodes `s` and `t` in an undirected graph. The program uses a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to calculate the shortest distances from `s` and `t` to all other nodes in the graph.

To optimize the program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary header files: The program includes `<functional>` and `<iostream>` header files, but they are not used. We can remove these lines.

2. Remove unnecessary `#pragma` directive: The `#pragma warning(disable : 4996)` directive is not needed. We can remove this line.

3. Remove unnecessary `#define` directive: The `INF` value is used as a constant for representing infinity. However, it is not used consistently in the program. We can remove this line and use `INT_MAX` from the `<limits.h>` header file instead.

4. Use `cin` and `cout` instead of `scanf` and `printf`: The program currently uses `scanf` and `printf` for input and output. We can use `cin` and `cout` from the `<iostream>` header file instead, which are type-safe and provide better performance.

5. Use `reserve` function for vector sizes: The vectors `G`, `d1`, `d2`, `r1`, and `r2` are initialized with a size of `N`, which is the number of nodes in the graph. We can use the `reserve` function to pre-allocate memory for these vectors to avoid unnecessary reallocations during push_back operations.

6. Use `emplace` instead of `push_back`: In the BFS loops, the program uses `push_back` to add elements to the vectors. We can use `emplace_back` instead, which constructs the element in-place without unnecessary copies.

7. Use `size_t` for loop variables: The loop variables `i` and `node` can be declared as `size_t` instead of `int` to avoid signed-unsigned comparison warnings.

8. Use `auto` for range-based loops: The program uses a range-based loop to iterate over the elements of `G[node]`. We can use `auto` instead of explicitly specifying the type of the elements.

9. Use `long long` for intermediate calculations: The variable `ret` is used to store the result of a calculation. We can change its type to `long long` to avoid overflow issues.

Here is the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <limits.h>
#include <queue>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

int main() {
  size_t N, M, s, t, u, v;
  cin >> N >> M >> s >> t;
  s--;
  t--;

  vector<vector<int>> G(N);
  G.reserve(N);
  for (size_t i = 0; i < M; i++) {
    cin >> u >> v;
    G[u - 1].emplace_back(v - 1);
    G[v - 1].emplace_back(u - 1);
  }

  vector<int> d1(N, INT_MAX), d2(N, INT_MAX);
  d1[s] = 0;
  d2[t] = 0;

  queue<size_t> que;
  que.push(s);
  while (!que.empty()) {
    size_t node = que.front();
    que.pop();
    for (auto neighbor : G[node]) {
      if (d1[neighbor] == INT_MAX) {
        d1[neighbor] = d1[node] + 1;
        que.push(neighbor);
      }
    }
  }

  que.push(t);
  while (!que.empty()) {
    size_t node = que.front();
    que.pop();
    for (auto neighbor : G[node]) {
      if (d2[neighbor] == INT_MAX) {
        d2[neighbor] = d2[node] + 1;
        que.push(neighbor);
      }
    }
  }

  int shortest = d1[t];
  vector<int> r1(shortest - 1, 0), r2(shortest - 1, 0);
  r1.reserve(shortest - 1);
  r2.reserve(shortest - 1);

  for (size_t i = 0; i < N; i++) {
    if (d1[i] < shortest - 1) {
      r1[d1[i]]++;
    }
  }

  for (size_t i = 0; i < N; i++) {
    if (d2[i] < shortest - 1) {
      r2[d2[i]]++;
    }
  }

  long long ret = 0;
  for (size_t i = 0; i < shortest - 1; i++) {
    ret += 1LL * r1[i] * r2[shortest - i - 2];
  }

  cout << ret << endl;
  return 0;
}
```
