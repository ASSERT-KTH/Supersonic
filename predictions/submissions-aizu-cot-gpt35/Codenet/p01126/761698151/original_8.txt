The given program reads inputs and simulates a game called "Amida". The game involves a ladder with multiple vertical bars, and the player needs to determine the final position of a ball dropped from a certain position.

To optimize the program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove the unnecessary check for `n` in the input loop: The variable `n` is not being used in the program, so we can remove the `cin >> n` statement.

2. Use a single-dimensional array instead of a two-dimensional array: Instead of using a two-dimensional array `amida[101][1001]`, we can use a single-dimensional array `amida[1001]` and calculate the index using the formula `amida[h * 1000 + p]`.

3. Minimize the number of array lookups: Instead of checking `amida[a][j]` and `amida[a - 1][j]` in each iteration, we can store the values in variables `current` and `previous` respectively and update them accordingly.

4. Break out of the loop if `a` reaches the boundary: If the value of `a` reaches the boundary of the ladder (0 or 1000), we can break out of the loop since the ball cannot move any further.

Here's the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int m, a;

  while (true) {
    cin >> m >> a;

    if (m == 0 && a == 0) {
      break;
    }
    
    int amida[1001] = {0};

    for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
      int h, p, q;
      cin >> h >> p >> q;
      amida[h * 1000 + p] = 1;
    }

    int current = a;
    int previous = a;

    for (int j = 1000; j > 0; j--) {
      if (amida[current * 1000 + j] == 1) {
        current++;
      } else if (amida[previous * 1000 + j] == 1) {
        current--;
        previous = current;
      }

      if (current == 0 || current == 1000) {
        break;
      }
    }

    cout << current << endl;
  }

  return 0;
}
```
