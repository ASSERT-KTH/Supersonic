The given program is a C++ program that takes input coordinates ax, ay, bx, by, and n, and then takes n pairs of coordinates cx, cy. For each pair of coordinates, it calculates the projection of the point (cx, cy) onto the line segment defined by points (ax, ay) and (bx, by), and prints the coordinates of the projected point.

To optimize the program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove the unnecessary inclusion of the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header. This header includes all the standard library headers, which can slow down the compilation process and increase memory usage. Instead, include only the necessary headers.

2. Avoid using the `complex` library for the `P` type. Since we are only interested in the real and imaginary parts of the complex number, we can use a simple struct or pair to represent the coordinates.

3. Avoid using the `using namespace std` directive. It is considered a bad practice as it can lead to name clashes and make the code less readable. Instead, use the `std::` prefix to specify the standard library functions and types.

4. Use `std::cin` and `std::cout` instead of `scanf` and `printf`. The `std::cin` and `std::cout` functions are type-safe and provide better error handling compared to the C-style input/output functions.

5. Avoid repetitive calculations inside the loop. Instead of recalculating the values for `P(ax, ay)`, `P(bx, by)`, and `P(cx, cy)` in each iteration, calculate them once before the loop and reuse them.

6. Use `std::setprecision` to control the precision of the output. Instead of using `printf` with a fixed precision specifier, use `std::setprecision` to specify the precision for the `std::cout` stream.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <iomanip>

struct Point {
  double x, y;
};

Point project(const Point& a, const Point& b, const Point& c) {
  double bx = b.x - a.x;
  double by = b.y - a.y;
  double cx = c.x - a.x;
  double cy = c.y - a.y;
  double dot = bx * cx + by * cy;
  double lenSq = bx * bx + by * by;
  double t = dot / lenSq;
  return {a.x + t * bx, a.y + t * by};
}

int main() {
  int n;
  double ax, ay, bx, by, cx, cy;
  std::cin >> ax >> ay >> bx >> by >> n;

  Point a = {ax, ay};
  Point b = {bx, by};

  while (n--) {
    std::cin >> cx >> cy;
    Point c = {cx, cy};
    Point p = project(a, b, c);
    std::cout << std::fixed << std::setprecision(8) << p.x << " " << p.y << "\n";
  }

  return 0;
}
```
