Step 1: Remove unnecessary header file
The program includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header file, which includes a lot of unnecessary header files. Since the program only requires the `<complex>` and `<iostream>` header files, we can remove the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header file.

Step 2: Remove unused variables
The program declares unused variables `ax`, `ay`, `bx`, `by`, `cx`, `cy`. We can remove these variables since they are not used in the program.

Step 3: Optimize the loop
The loop in the program reads `n` points and calculates the projection of each point. However, the loop can be optimized by precalculating the values `b - a` and `c - a` outside the loop. This way, we only need to calculate these values once instead of repeatedly calculating them for each iteration of the loop.

Step 4: Use `std::cout` instead of `printf`
The program currently uses `printf` to print the coordinates of the projected points. We can use `std::cout` instead, which is faster and more efficient.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <complex>
using namespace std;

typedef complex<double> P;

P project(P a, P b, P c) {
    b -= a, c -= a;
    return a + b * real(c / b);
}

int main() {
    double ax, ay, bx, by;
    int n;
    
    cin >> ax >> ay >> bx >> by >> n;
    P ab = P(bx - ax, by - ay);

    while (n--) {
        double cx, cy;
        cin >> cx >> cy;
        P ac = P(cx - ax, cy - ay);
        P p = ax + ab * real(ac / ab);
        cout << fixed << setprecision(8) << p.real() << " " << p.imag() << "\n";
    }

    return 0;
}
```
