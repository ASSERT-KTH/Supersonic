Step 1: Remove unnecessary includes
The program includes `<bits/stdc++.h>`, which is not necessary. We can remove it.

Step 2: Optimize complex number operations
The program uses the `complex<double>` type for calculations involving points. However, using complex numbers for this purpose introduces unnecessary overhead. We can optimize the program by directly using the point coordinates instead of complex numbers.

Step 3: Remove unused variables
The variables `ax`, `ay`, `bx`, `by` are only used to create `P` objects in the `project` function. We can remove these variables and initialize the `P` objects directly using the input values.

Step 4: Optimize the `project` function
The `project` function can be optimized by directly calculating the projected point coordinates using the input values, without creating and manipulating complex numbers.

Step 5: Optimize the input/output operations
The program can be optimized by using `scanf` and `printf` for input/output instead of `cin` and `cout`. This can significantly improve the performance.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cstdio>

struct Point {
  double x, y;
};

Point project(Point a, Point b, Point c) {
  b.x -= a.x, b.y -= a.y;
  c.x -= a.x, c.y -= a.y;
  double dot = b.x * c.x + b.y * c.y;
  double lenSq = b.x * b.x + b.y * b.y;
  double t = dot / lenSq;
  return {a.x + t * b.x, a.y + t * b.y};
}

int main() {
  int n;
  Point a, b, c;
  scanf("%lf %lf %lf %lf %d", &a.x, &a.y, &b.x, &b.y, &n);
  while (n--) {
    scanf("%lf %lf", &c.x, &c.y);
    Point p = project(a, b, c);
    printf("%.8f %.8f\n", p.x, p.y);
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Explanation:
1. Removed the unnecessary include `<bits/stdc++.h>`.
2. Changed the `typedef` to a `struct` for representing points.
3. Removed the unused variables `ax`, `ay`, `bx`, `by`, and initialized the `Point` objects directly using the input values.
4. Optimized the `project` function to directly calculate the projected point coordinates.
5. Replaced the input/output operations with `scanf` and `printf` for better performance.
