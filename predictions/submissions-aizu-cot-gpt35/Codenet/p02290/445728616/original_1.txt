Step 1: Remove unnecessary header inclusion
The `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` includes a large number of standard library headers, which can lead to longer compilation times. Since the program only uses a few standard headers, we can remove this line and include only the necessary headers.

Step 2: Avoid unnecessary type aliasing
The `typedef complex<double> P;` creates an alias for the `complex<double>` type called `P`. However, this type alias is only used once in the program. We can directly use `complex<double>` instead of `P` to simplify the code.

Step 3: Avoid unnecessary subtraction
In the `project` function, the lines `b -= a, c -= a;` subtract `a` from `b` and `c`. These operations modify the original objects and are not necessary for the calculation. We can remove these lines to optimize the code.

Step 4: Use `std::cout` instead of `printf`
The `printf` function from the C standard library is used to print the results. However, the program is written in C++, so it is more appropriate to use `std::cout` for output. This allows us to remove the `#include <cstdio>` line.

Step 5: Optimize floating-point precision
The `printf` statement `printf("%.8f %.8f\n", p.real(), p.imag());` prints the real and imaginary parts of a complex number with 8 decimal places. We can optimize this by using `std::cout` with `std::setprecision` and `std::fixed` manipulators to achieve the same result.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <complex>
#include <iomanip>

typedef std::complex<double> Complex;

Complex project(Complex a, Complex b, Complex c) {
  return a + b * std::real(c / b);
}

int main() {
  double ax, ay, bx, by, cx, cy;
  int n;

  std::cin >> ax >> ay >> bx >> by >> n;

  while (n--) {
    std::cin >> cx >> cy;
    Complex p = project(Complex(ax, ay), Complex(bx, by), Complex(cx, cy));
    std::cout << std::fixed << std::setprecision(8) << p.real() << ' ' << p.imag() << '\n';
  }

  return 0;
}
```
