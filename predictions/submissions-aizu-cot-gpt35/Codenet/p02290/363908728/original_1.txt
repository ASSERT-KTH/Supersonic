The given program can be optimized by removing unnecessary includes, removing unused variables and functions, and removing unnecessary operations in the `projection` function.

Here are the steps to optimize the program:

1. Remove the unnecessary includes `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` and `using namespace std;`. These includes are not needed in this program.

2. Remove the unused struct `CWW` and the instance `STAR`. They are not used in the program.

3. Remove the unused constants `EPS` and `INF`. They are not used in the program.

4. Remove the unused struct `Segment` and `Circle`. They are not used in the program.

5. Remove the unused `using Polygon = vector<Point>;`. It is not used in the program.

6. Remove the unused `istream` and `ostream` operators for `Line` and `Point`. They are not used in the program.

7. Remove the unused functions `dot` and `cross`. They are not used in the program.

8. Optimize the `projection` function by removing the unnecessary division operation `b / a`. Since `a` is a complex number, the division operation is not needed. The updated `projection` function would look like this:

```cpp
Point projection(const Point &a, const Point &b) {
  return a * dot(b, a) / norm(a);
}
```

9. Optimize the main loop by removing the unnecessary subtraction operation `L.p2 - L.p1` in the `projection` function call. Instead, we can precalculate the vector `v = L.p2 - L.p1` outside the loop. The updated main loop would look like this:

```cpp
Point v = L.p2 - L.p1;
while (Q--) {
  Point p;
  cin >> p;
  Point w = L.p1 + projection(v, p - L.p1);
  cout << w << endl;
}
```

After applying all these optimizations, the optimized program would look like this:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <complex>
using namespace std;

using D = double;
using Point = complex<D>;
struct Line {
  Point p1, p2;
  Line(const Point &p1 = Point(), const Point &p2 = Point()) : p1(p1), p2(p2) {}
};

Point projection(const Point &a, const Point &b) {
  return a * dot(b, a) / norm(a);
}

int main() {
  Line L;
  cin >> L;
  int Q;
  cin >> Q;
  Point v = L.p2 - L.p1;
  while (Q--) {
    Point p;
    cin >> p;
    Point w = L.p1 + projection(v, p - L.p1);
    cout << w << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```
