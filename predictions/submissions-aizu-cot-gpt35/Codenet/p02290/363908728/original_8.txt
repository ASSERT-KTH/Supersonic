Optimization Steps:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The program includes `<bits/stdc++.h>`, which is not necessary and can be replaced with the necessary headers only.

2. Remove unused constants: The program defines the constants `EPS` and `INF`, but they are not used. We can remove them to improve the clarity of the code.

3. Remove unnecessary struct: The struct `CWW` is not used anywhere in the program. We can remove it to simplify the code.

4. Change the `Point` type: The program uses `complex<double>` as the `Point` type. However, using complex numbers for this purpose is unnecessary and can be replaced with a simple struct or class to store the x and y coordinates. This will reduce the memory usage and improve performance.

5. Remove unnecessary constructors: The structs `Segment`, `Line`, and `Circle` define constructors with default arguments. However, these default arguments are not used in the program. We can remove the default arguments to simplify the code.

6. Use pass-by-reference in operator overloading: The `operator>>` and `operator<<` functions for `Point` and `Line` currently take the objects by value. We can modify them to take the objects by reference (`const &`) to avoid unnecessary copying and improve performance.

7. Avoid unnecessary calculations: The `projection` function currently calculates `a * real(b / a)`. However, the division operation (`b / a`) is unnecessary and can be avoided to improve performance.

8. Use `'\n'` instead of `endl`: The program uses `endl` to end each line of output. However, `endl` also flushes the output, which can be a performance bottleneck. We can use `'\n'` instead, which only adds a newline character without flushing the output.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <iomanip>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

struct Point {
  double x, y;
};

struct Line {
  Point p1, p2;
};

istream &operator>>(istream &is, Point &a) {
  return is >> a.x >> a.y;
}

ostream &operator<<(ostream &os, Point &a) {
  return os << a.x << " " << a.y;
}

istream &operator>>(istream &is, Line &l) {
  return is >> l.p1 >> l.p2;
}

Point projection(const Point &a, const Point &b) {
  return {a.x * b.x / (a.x * a.x + a.y * a.y), a.y * b.y / (a.x * a.x + a.y * a.y)};
}

int main() {
  Line L;
  cin >> L;
  int Q;
  cin >> Q;
  while (Q--) {
    Point p;
    cin >> p;
    Point w = {L.p1.x + projection(L.p2 - L.p1, p - L.p1).x, L.p1.y + projection(L.p2 - L.p1, p - L.p1).y};
    cout << fixed << setprecision(15) << w << '\n';
  }
  return 0;
}
```
