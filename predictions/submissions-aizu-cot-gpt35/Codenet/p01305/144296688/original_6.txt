The given program calculates the win rate for a game by simulating all possible combinations of moves. However, it uses nested loops and repetitive calculations, resulting in high time complexity and memory usage.

To optimize the program, we can eliminate the nested loops and repetitive calculations by using a recursive function. This recursive function will generate all possible combinations of moves and calculate the win rate for each combination.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

double calculateWinRate(vector<vector<int>>& a, vector<int>& num, int idx) {
    if (idx == 9) {
        int geitu = 0, jacky = 0;
        for (int m = 0; m < 9; m++) {
            geitu += num[m];
            jacky += a[1][m] - num[m];
        }
        if (geitu > jacky)
            return 1.0;
        else if (geitu < jacky)
            return 0.0;
        else
            return 0.5;
    }
    
    double winrate = 0.0;
    for (int i = 0; i < 9; i++) {
        if (num[i] == -1) {
            num[i] = a[0][idx];
            winrate += calculateWinRate(a, num, idx + 1);
            num[i] = -1;
        }
    }
    return winrate;
}

int main() {
    int n;
    cin >> n;
    
    for (int l = 0; l < n; l++) {
        vector<vector<int>> a(2, vector<int>(9));
        for (int j = 0; j < 2; j++) {
            for (int k = 0; k < 9; k++)
                cin >> a[j][k];
        }
        
        vector<int> num(9, -1);
        double winrate1 = calculateWinRate(a, num, 0);
        double winrate2 = 1.0 - winrate1;
        
        cout << fixed;
        cout.precision(5);
        cout << winrate1 << " " << winrate2 << "\n";
    }
    
    return 0;
}
```

Explanation of optimization:
1. The nested loops for generating combinations of moves have been replaced by a recursive function `calculateWinRate`.
2. The function takes the game state (`a`), the current move combination (`num`) and the current index (`idx`) as parameters.
3. The function calculates the win rate for the current move combination by recursively generating all possible combinations of moves.
4. The function returns the win rate for the current move combination.
5. In the main function, the game state and the initial move combination are passed to `calculateWinRate` to calculate the win rates.
6. The win rates are then printed with 5 decimal places of precision.
