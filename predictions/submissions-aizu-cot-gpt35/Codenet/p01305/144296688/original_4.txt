The given program calculates the win rates for a game by simulating all possible outcomes. It uses nested loops to iterate through all possible combinations of moves and calculates the win rate for each combination.

To optimize the program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Instead of using nested loops to iterate through all possible combinations of moves, we can use a recursive function to generate all possible combinations. This will simplify the code and reduce the number of nested loops.

2. Instead of storing the win rates for each combination in separate variables (winrate1 and winrate2), we can calculate the win rates directly inside the recursive function and pass the win rates as parameters to the function. This will eliminate the need for storing and updating winrate1 and winrate2 in each iteration.

3. We can eliminate the unnecessary calculations for winrate1 and winrate2 by calculating them only once after all combinations have been generated.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

void calculateWinRates(int a[2][9], int num[2][9], int z, double& winrate1, double& winrate2, int depth) {
  if (depth == 9) {
    int geitu = 0, jacky = 0;
    for (int m = 0; m < 9; m++) {
      geitu += num[0][m];
      jacky += num[1][m];
    }
    if (geitu > jacky)
      winrate1++;
    else if (geitu < jacky)
      winrate2++;
    return;
  }

  for (int i = 0; i < 9; i++) {
    if (i == z)
      continue;
    num[0][depth] = 0;
    num[1][depth] = 0;
    if (a[0][depth] > a[1][i])
      num[0][depth] = (a[0][depth] + a[1][i]);
    else
      num[1][depth] = (a[0][depth] + a[1][i]);
    calculateWinRates(a, num, z, winrate1, winrate2, depth + 1);
  }
}

int main() {
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  for (int l = 0; l < n; l++) {
    int a[2][9], num[2][9];
    double winrate1 = 0, winrate2 = 0;
    for (int j = 0; j < 2; j++) {
      for (int k = 0; k < 9; k++)
        cin >> a[j][k];
    }
    for (int z = 0; z < 9; z++) {
      calculateWinRates(a, num, z, winrate1, winrate2, 0);
    }
    double ans = winrate1 / 362880;
    double ans2 = winrate2 / 362880;
    cout << ans << " " << ans2 << "\n";
  }
  return 0;
}
```

In the optimized program, we use a recursive function `calculateWinRates` to generate all possible combinations of moves. We pass the arrays `a` and `num`, the current index `z`, the win rates `winrate1` and `winrate2`, and the current depth of recursion `depth` as parameters to the function.

Inside the `calculateWinRates` function, we check if the depth is equal to 9. If it is, we calculate the win rates based on the generated combination of moves and update `winrate1` and `winrate2` accordingly.

If the depth is less than 9, we iterate through all possible moves for the current index `z` and recursively call `calculateWinRates` with the updated `num` array and incremented `depth`.

After all combinations have been generated, we calculate the win rates `ans` and `ans2` by dividing `winrate1` and `winrate2` by the total number of combinations (362880 in this case) and print the results.
