The given program is using a nested loop structure to iterate through all possible combinations of two arrays `a[2][9]`. For each combination, it calculates the win rate and prints it.

To optimize this program, we can reduce the number of nested loops by using a recursive function. This will eliminate the need for the multiple nested loops and significantly reduce the running time and memory usage.

Here's the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

double calculateWinRate(int num[2][9], int a[2][9], int depth) {
  if (depth == 9) {
    int geitu = 0, jacky = 0;
    for (int m = 0; m < 9; m++) {
      geitu += num[0][m];
      jacky += num[1][m];
    }
    if (geitu > jacky)
      return 1.0;
    else if (geitu < jacky)
      return 0.0;
    else
      return 0.5;
  }

  double winrate1 = 0.0;
  for (int z = 0; z < 9; z++) {
    if (num[0][depth] != 0 || num[1][z] != 0)
      continue;
    num[0][depth] = a[0][depth] + a[1][z];
    num[1][z] = a[0][depth] + a[1][z];
    winrate1 += calculateWinRate(num, a, depth + 1);
    num[0][depth] = 0;
    num[1][z] = 0;
  }

  return winrate1;
}

int main() {
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  for (int l = 0; l < n; l++) {
    int num[2][9], a[2][9];
    double winrate1 = 0, winrate2 = 0;
    for (int j = 0; j < 2; j++) {
      for (int k = 0; k < 9; k++)
        cin >> a[j][k];
    }
    winrate1 = calculateWinRate(num, a, 0);
    winrate2 = 362880 - winrate1;
    double ans = winrate1 / 362880;
    double ans2 = winrate2 / 362880;
    cout << fixed;
    cout.precision(5);
    cout << ans << " " << ans2 << "\n";
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Explanation of the optimization steps:

1. Created a recursive function `calculateWinRate` that takes `num`, `a`, and `depth` as parameters. `num` is used to store the calculated values for each combination, `a` contains the input values, and `depth` represents the current depth of recursion.

2. In the `calculateWinRate` function, if `depth` reaches 9, it means all elements of `num` have been filled. At this point, we calculate the win rate based on the sums of `num` array and return the result.

3. Inside the recursive function, we iterate through all possible combinations of `a[depth]` and `a[1]`. If the current combination is valid (the corresponding elements in `num` are 0), we calculate the win rate recursively by setting the values in `num` and incrementing the `depth` by 1.

4. After the recursive calculation, we reset the modified values in `num` to 0 to ensure the correctness of future combinations.

5. In the main function, we call `calculateWinRate` to calculate the win rate for the given input arrays `a`. We also calculate the `winrate2` by subtracting `winrate1` from the total number of combinations (362880).

6. Finally, we calculate the final win rate and print it with 5 decimal places precision.
