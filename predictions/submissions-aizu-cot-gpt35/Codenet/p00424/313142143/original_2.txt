The original program reads a number `n` from the user, followed by `n` pairs of characters `a` and `b`. It then calculates the difference between `b` and `a` for each pair and stores it in an array `d`. Finally, it reads `n` more characters `a` from the user and prints the character `a` plus the value in `d[a]`.

To optimize this program, we can make the following changes:

1. Use `std::vector` instead of a fixed-size array for `d` to avoid wasting memory.
2. Use `std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false)` to disable synchronization between C and C++ standard streams, which can improve input/output performance.
3. Use `std::endl` instead of `"\n"` with `puts("")` to flush the output buffer after each line, which can improve output performance.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

int main() {
  std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);

  int n;
  while (std::cin >> n && n) {
    std::vector<int> d(256, 0);

    char a, b;
    while (n--) {
      std::cin >> a >> b;
      d[a] = b - a;
    }

    while (n--) {
      std::cin >> a;
      std::cout << (char)(a + d[a]);
    }

    std::cout << std::endl;
  }

  return 0;
}
```
