The original program reads a number `n` from input and then enters a loop where it reads pairs of characters `a` and `b`. It calculates the difference between `b` and `a` and stores it in an array `d` at the index corresponding to the ASCII value of `a`. Then, it again reads a number `n` and enters another loop where it reads `n` characters `a` from input and prints `a` plus the difference stored in `d` at the index corresponding to the ASCII value of `a`.

To optimize this program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Instead of using `#import <iostream>`, we can use `#include <iostream>` which is the correct syntax for including the iostream library in C++.

2. We can remove the unnecessary `puts("")` statement after the first loop as it is not needed.

3. We can remove the second loop and read and print the characters `a` directly inside the first loop. This will eliminate the need to read the value of `n` again.

4. We can remove the declaration of the array `d` inside the first loop and move it outside the loop. This will ensure that the array is not re-initialized in each iteration of the loop.

5. We can remove the subtraction operation when storing the difference between `b` and `a` in the array `d`. Instead of `d[a] = b - a`, we can simply use `d[a] = b`.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#define z std::cin >>
int main() {
  int n;
  int d[256] = {};
  for (char a, b; z n, n;) {
    for (; n--; ) {
      z a >> b;
      d[a] = b;
      putchar(a + d[a]);
    }
  }
}
```
