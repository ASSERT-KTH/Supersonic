The original program reads a number `n` from input and then proceeds to read `n` pairs of characters `a` and `b`. For each pair, it calculates the difference between `b` and `a` and stores it in an array `d`. Then, it reads another number `n` from input and for each character `a`, it prints `a + d[a]`.

To optimize this program, we can make the following changes:

1. Instead of using `std::cin` and `std::cout`, we can use the faster `scanf` and `printf` functions from the C standard library.
2. We can avoid using `puts("")` to print a newline character and instead use `putchar('\n')`.
3. We can remove the `#import <iostream>` statement as it is not needed.

Here's the optimized code:

```c++
#include <cstdio>

int main() {
  int n;
  while (scanf("%d", &n) == 1 && n) {
    int d[256] = {};
    while (n--) {
      char a, b;
      scanf(" %c %c", &a, &b);
      d[a] = b - a;
    }
    scanf("%d", &n);
    while (n--) {
      char a;
      scanf(" %c", &a);
      putchar(a + d[a]);
    }
    putchar('\n');
  }
}
```
