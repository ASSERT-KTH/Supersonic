Step 1: Removing unnecessary header
The program includes the `<iostream>` header, but it is not used in the code. Therefore, we can remove this line to optimize the program.

Step 2: Replacing `std::cin` and `std::cout` with `scanf` and `printf`
Using `scanf` and `printf` functions instead of `std::cin` and `std::cout` can lead to faster input/output operations. We can replace `std::cin` with `scanf` and `puts` with `printf` to optimize the program.

Step 3: Simplifying the loop condition
The loop condition `z n, n` can be simplified to `z n` since the value of `n` is not used after this line.

Step 4: Reusing the variable `a`
In the second loop, the variable `a` is used to read input characters and print them. We can reuse the same variable to avoid unnecessary memory usage.

Step 5: Removing unnecessary array
The array `d` is used to store the difference between characters `a` and `b`. However, it is not used after the second loop. We can remove this array to optimize memory usage.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <cstdio>

int main() {
  int n;
  for (char a; scanf("%d", &n) == 1 && n; printf("\n")) {
    for (; n--; ) {
      char b;
      scanf(" %c %c", &a, &b);
      putchar(b - a);
    }
    for (; n--; ) {
      scanf(" %c", &a);
      putchar(a);
    }
  }
}
```
