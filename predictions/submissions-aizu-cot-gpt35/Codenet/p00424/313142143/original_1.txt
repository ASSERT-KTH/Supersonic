Explanation of the optimization steps:

1. Remove unnecessary header file: The program does not use any features from the `iostream` library, so we can remove the `#include <iostream>` line.

2. Remove unnecessary macro: The macro `#define z std::cin >>` is not necessary and can be removed. We can directly use `std::cin >>` instead.

3. Move variable declarations inside the for loop: The variables `a` and `b` are only used inside the for loop, so we can move their declarations inside the loop to limit their scope.

4. Optimize the second for loop: In the second for loop, we are using `putchar(a + d[a])`, which involves an addition operation. We can optimize this by precalculating `a + d[a]` before the loop and using a separate variable to store this value.

5. Remove unnecessary `puts("")` line: The `puts("")` line is unnecessary and can be removed.

Optimized program:

```cpp
#include <cstdio>

int main() {
  int n;
  while (std::cin >> n && n) {
    for (int i = 0; i < 256; i++) {
      int d[256] = {};
      for (; n--; ) {
        char a, b;
        std::cin >> a >> b;
        d[a] = b - a;
      }
      for (; n--; ) {
        char a;
        std::cin >> a;
        char result = a + d[a];
        std::putchar(result);
      }
    }
  }
}
```
