Step 1: Remove unnecessary variables and operations
- The variable `i` is only used as an index in the loops. We can replace it with the loop variable itself to eliminate the need for an additional variable.
- The `puts("")` statement at the end of the outer loop is unnecessary and can be removed.

Step 2: Optimize memory usage
- The array `t` is declared with a fixed size of 999. We can optimize the memory usage by dynamically allocating memory for `t` based on the input value of `n`.
- Instead of using `bzero` to zero out the memory of `t`, we can use `memset` which is more efficient.

Step 3: Improve input/output operations
- The `scanf` and `printf` functions are called multiple times inside the loops, which can be time-consuming. We can optimize this by using a single `scanf` and `printf` outside the loops, and store the input values in an array. Then, we can iterate over the array to process the values.

Step 4: Combine the inner loops
- The two inner loops can be combined into a single loop to eliminate the need for nested loops.

Here's the optimized version of the program:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int main() {
  int n;
  scanf("%d", &n);

  while (n) {
    int *t = (int*)malloc(n * sizeof(int));
    memset(t, 0, n * sizeof(int));

    char input[2 * n + 1];
    scanf("%s", input);

    int index = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      sscanf(&input[index], " %c %c", &index, &t[i]);
    }

    scanf("%d", &n);

    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      putchar(!t[i] * i + t[i]);
    }

    free(t);
  }

  return 0;
}
```
