Explanation of the optimization steps:

1. Remove the unnecessary `puts("")` statement: The `puts("")` statement is not needed as it adds an extra newline character after each test case. We can remove it to optimize the program.

2. Replace `bzero` with `memset`: The `bzero` function is deprecated in modern C/C++ standards. We can replace it with the `memset` function to zero-initialize the `t` array.

3. Remove the second `scanf` call: The second `scanf` call is not necessary as it is not being used in the loop. We can safely remove it to optimize the program.

4. Simplify the `putchar` statement: The `putchar(!t[i] * i + t[i])` statement can be simplified to `putchar(t[i])`. This is because `!t[i] * i + t[i]` is equivalent to `t[i]` in this context.

5. Declare the loop variables inside the loop: It is generally considered good practice to declare loop variables inside the loop itself. We should declare the loop variable `i` inside the for loop where it is being used.

Optimized code:

```cpp
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int main() {
  int n, t[999];
  for (; n *= scanf("%d", &n); putchar('\n')) {
    memset(t, 0, sizeof(t));
    for (int i = 0; n--; t[i] = *t)
      scanf(" %c %c", &i, t);
    for (; n--; putchar(t[i]))
      scanf(" %c", &i);
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Note: I have assumed that the size of the `t` array is fixed at 999. If the size needs to be dynamic, please provide the necessary information, and the code can be modified accordingly.
