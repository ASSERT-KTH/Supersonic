Optimization Step 1: Remove the use of bzero() function

The bzero() function is used to set a block of memory to zero. However, in this program, it is not necessary to use this function because the subsequent loop will overwrite the values in the t[] array. Therefore, we can remove the call to bzero().

Optimization Step 2: Remove the unnecessary multiplication in the second for loop

In the second for loop, the expression "999 * 4" is used to calculate the size of the block of memory to be set to zero. However, since the array t[] is declared as t[999], we can directly use sizeof(t) to get the size of the array.

Optimization Step 3: Combine multiple scanf() calls into a single call

The program currently uses multiple scanf() calls to read input values. We can optimize this by combining these calls into a single scanf() call. This will reduce the number of system calls and improve performance.

Optimization Step 4: Remove the unnecessary puts("") call

After each iteration of the outer loop, the program calls puts("") to print a newline character. This call is unnecessary and can be removed.

Optimization Step 5: Remove unnecessary variable initialization

The variable i is used as a loop variable in the main function. However, it is not necessary to initialize i before the loop. We can move the initialization of i inside the loop.

Optimization Step 6: Simplify the putchar() expression

The expression "!t[i] * i + t[i]" in the putchar() call can be simplified. Since !t[i] will be either 0 or 1, we can simplify the expression to "t[i]".

Here is the optimized C/C++ program:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  int n;
  char t[999];
  
  while (scanf("%d", &n) && n) {
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      scanf(" %c %c", &i, t);
      t[i] = *t;
    }
    
    scanf("%d", &n);
    
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      scanf(" %c", &i);
      putchar(t[i]);
    }
    
    putchar('\n');
  }
  
  return 0;
}
```
