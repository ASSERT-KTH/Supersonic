The given program reads inputs from the user and performs some operations based on those inputs. It uses a loop to read integers and characters from the user and then performs some calculations and prints the result.

To optimize this program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove the unnecessary use of `bzero` function: The `bzero` function is used to initialize the `t` array to zero. However, this step is not necessary because the array is initialized again in the next loop. We can remove the `bzero` function call to improve the runtime efficiency.

2. Use a more efficient way to initialize the array: Instead of using a separate loop to initialize each element of the `t` array to zero, we can use the `memset` function to initialize the entire array in a single call. This will improve the runtime efficiency.

3. Simplify the calculation in the inner loop: The calculation `putchar(!t[i] * i + t[i])` can be simplified to `putchar(t[i])`. This is because the expression `!t[i] * i + t[i]` is equivalent to `t[i]` when `t[i]` is either 0 or 1. This simplification will improve the runtime efficiency.

Here is the optimized program:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int main() {
  int n, t[999];
  int i;

  while (scanf("%d", &n) && n) {
    memset(t, 0, sizeof(t));

    for (; n--; t[i] = *t)
      scanf(" %d %d", &i, t);

    for (scanf("%d", &n); n--; putchar(t[i]))
      scanf(" %d", &i);

    putchar('\n');
  }

  return 0;
}
```
