Step 1: Remove unnecessary variable declaration and initialization.

In the given program, the variable `i` is declared in the `main()` function but never used. We can remove this declaration to simplify the code.

Step 2: Use a more efficient memory allocation function.

The `bzero()` function is used to set all elements of the array `t` to zero. Instead of using `bzero()`, we can use the `memset()` function which is more efficient.

Step 3: Optimize the loop conditions.

The loop conditions in the program can be optimized to improve performance. The current condition `n *= scanf("%d", &n)` is a bit confusing and can be simplified to `scanf("%d", &n)`.

Step 4: Avoid redundant calculations.

In the second loop, the expression `!t[i] * i + t[i]` can be simplified. Since both `!t[i]` and `t[i]` are either 0 or 1, we can simply use `t[i]` instead of `!t[i] * i + t[i]`.

Here is the optimized version of the program:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int t[999];

int main() {
  int n;
  while (scanf("%d", &n) == 1) {
    memset(t, 0, sizeof(t));
    for (; n > 0; n--) {
      int i;
      char c;
      scanf(" %d %c", &i, &c);
      t[i] = c;
    }
    scanf("%d", &n);
    for (; n > 0; n--) {
      int i;
      scanf(" %d", &i);
      putchar(t[i]);
    }
    putchar('\n');
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Explanation of optimizations:

1. Removed unnecessary variable declaration and initialization.
2. Replaced `bzero()` with `memset()` for more efficient memory allocation.
3. Simplified loop conditions for better readability.
4. Simplified the expression in the second loop to avoid redundant calculations.
