Step 1: Remove unnecessary variables and function calls
- The variable `i` is not used anywhere in the program. We can remove it.
- The `puts("")` function call is not necessary. We can remove it.

Step 2: Replace `bzero` with `memset`
- The `bzero` function call can be replaced with the more common `memset` function call.

Step 3: Optimize the inner loops
- The inner loops can be optimized by combining the two loops into one loop.
- Instead of using two separate loops to read input and output, we can read input and output in the same loop.

Step 4: Optimize the outer loop
- Instead of using the `scanf` return value to control the loop, we can use a `while` loop with a conditional check for `scanf`.

Step 5: Remove unnecessary variable initialization
- The variable `n` is initialized to 0 at the beginning of the program, but it is immediately overwritten by the `scanf` call. We can remove the initial assignment.

Optimized program:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int main() {
    int n;
    int t[999];

    while (scanf("%d", &n) == 1) {
        memset(t, 0, 999 * sizeof(int));

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            scanf(" %d %d", &i, &t[i]);
        }

        scanf("%d", &n);

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            putchar(!t[i] * i + t[i]);
        }
    }

    return 0;
}
```
