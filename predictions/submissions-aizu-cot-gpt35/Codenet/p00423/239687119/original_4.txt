Step 1: Remove unnecessary variable "vec"

The variable "vec" is not used anywhere in the program. We can safely remove it.

Step 2: Avoid unnecessary vector resizing

The vectors "veca" and "vecb" are resized in each iteration of the while loop. This can be avoided by pre-allocating the required size of the vectors.

Step 3: Avoid unnecessary copying of values

The values of "a" and "b" are pushed into the vectors "veca" and "vecb" after each iteration of the for loop. We can avoid this by directly printing the values instead of storing them in vectors.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

int main() {
    int n;
    int a = 0;
    int b = 0;
    int game_a, game_b;
    std::vector<int> veca, vecb;

    while (true) {
        std::cin >> n;
        if (n == 0)
            break;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            std::cin >> game_a >> game_b;
            if (game_a == game_b) {
                a += game_a;
                b += game_b;
            } else if (game_a > game_b)
                a += game_a + game_b;
            else
                b += game_a + game_b;
        }
        
        std::cout << a << " " << b << std::endl;
        a = 0;
        b = 0;
    }

    return 0;
}
```
