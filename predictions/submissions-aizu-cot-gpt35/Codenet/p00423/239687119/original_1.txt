To optimize the given program, we can make the following changes:

1. Remove the unnecessary `vec` variable, as it is not being used.

2. Change the `while (1)` loop condition to `while (true)` for better readability.

3. Instead of using a separate loop to print the results, we can print the results while calculating them in the main loop.

4. Instead of using a vector to store the results, we can directly print them.

5. Initialize `a` and `b` to 0 inside the `else` block, instead of outside the loop.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  int n;
  while (true) {
    std::cin >> n;
    if (n == 0)
      break;
    else {
      int a = 0;
      int b = 0;
      for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        int game_a, game_b;
        std::cin >> game_a >> game_b;
        if (game_a == game_b) {
          a += game_a;
          b += game_b;
        } else if (game_a > game_b)
          a += game_a + game_b;
        else
          b += game_a + game_b;
      }
      std::cout << a << " " << b << std::endl;
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```
