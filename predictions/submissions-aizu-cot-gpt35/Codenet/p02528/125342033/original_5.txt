Explanation of optimization steps:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The `<algorithm>` header is not needed as the only algorithm used is `std::sort` which is already included in `<cstdio>`. We can remove the `<algorithm>` header.

2. Optimize the loop: In the second loop `for (i = f = 0; i < n; i++)`, the variable `f` is used to determine whether to print a space before the number. Instead of using `f`, we can directly print a space before each number except the first one. This eliminates the need for the `f` variable.

3. Avoid unnecessary assignment: In the second loop, the assignment `f = 1` is performed in each iteration. Since we only need to assign `1` once, we can move the assignment outside the loop to avoid unnecessary assignments.

Optimized program:

```cpp
#include <cstdio>

int main() {
  int n, i, A[1000001];
  scanf("%d", &n);
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++)
    scanf("%d", A + i);
  std::sort(A, A + n);
  printf("%d", A[0]);
  for (i = 1; i < n; i++)
    printf(" %d", A[i]);
  puts("");
}
```
