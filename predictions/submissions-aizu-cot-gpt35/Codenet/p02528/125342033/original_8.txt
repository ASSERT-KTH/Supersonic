Explanation of the optimization step by step:

1. Remove unnecessary header files: The program includes the `<algorithm>` and `<cstdio>` header files, but it does not use any functions from these headers. We can remove these header file includes.

2. Remove unnecessary variables: The variables `i` and `f` are used in the loops and for printing, but they are not necessary. We can remove these variables and simplify the loops.

3. Remove unnecessary condition: The condition `f ? " %d" : "%d"` in the `printf` statement is used to add a space before every number except the first one. We can simplify this by always adding a space before the number and then remove the space after the last number.

4. Optimize the sorting algorithm: The program uses `std::sort` function to sort the array `A`. We can optimize this by using a more efficient sorting algorithm, such as quicksort.

5. Reduce the size of the array: The array `A` is declared with a size of 1000001, which is larger than necessary. We can reduce the size of the array to match the input size `n`.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <cstdio>

void quicksort(int* arr, int left, int right) {
  if (left < right) {
    int pivot = arr[right];
    int i = left - 1;

    for (int j = left; j <= right - 1; j++) {
      if (arr[j] < pivot) {
        i++;
        std::swap(arr[i], arr[j]);
      }
    }

    std::swap(arr[i + 1], arr[right]);

    quicksort(arr, left, i);
    quicksort(arr, i + 2, right);
  }
}

int main() {
  int n;
  scanf("%d", &n);

  int A[n];
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    scanf("%d", &A[i]);
  }

  quicksort(A, 0, n - 1);

  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    printf("%d ", A[i]);
  }
  puts("");
}
```
