The given program reads an array of integers, sorts it in ascending order, and then prints the sorted array. 

To optimize the program for running time and memory usage, we can make the following modifications:

1. Instead of using the `<algorithm>` library to sort the array, we can implement a more efficient sorting algorithm, such as quicksort or mergesort. This would improve the running time of the program.

2. We can remove the unnecessary `f` variable and simplify the print loop to directly print each element of the sorted array without checking if it's the first element or not. This would reduce the number of print statements and improve the running time.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <cstdio>

void quicksort(int arr[], int left, int right) {
  if (left >= right) return;
  int pivot = arr[right];
  int i = left - 1;
  for (int j = left; j < right; j++) {
    if (arr[j] <= pivot) {
      i++;
      std::swap(arr[i], arr[j]);
    }
  }
  std::swap(arr[i + 1], arr[right]);

  quicksort(arr, left, i);
  quicksort(arr, i + 2, right);
}

int main() {
  int n, A[1000001];
  scanf("%d", &n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    scanf("%d", A + i);

  quicksort(A, 0, n - 1);

  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    printf("%d ", A[i]);
  puts("");
}
```

Explanation of the optimizations:

1. Implemented quicksort: I replaced the `std::sort` function with an implementation of the quicksort algorithm. Quick sort is generally faster than the default sorting algorithm used by `std::sort` in most cases.

2. Removed the unnecessary `f` variable: Instead of using `f` to check if it's the first element or not, I directly printed each element of the sorted array using a space separator. This simplifies the code and reduces the number of print statements.

These optimizations should improve the running time and memory usage of the program.
