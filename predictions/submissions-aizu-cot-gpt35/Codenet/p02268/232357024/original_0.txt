The given program is a binary search algorithm that searches for a given value in an array of integers. The optimization can be done in the following steps:

1. Remove unnecessary header files: The `<cstdio>` header file is not needed in this program as we are not using any functions from it. Therefore, we can remove the line `#include <cstdio>`.

2. Remove unused variable: The variable `q` is declared but not used in the program. We can remove the line `int q;`.

3. Use `cin` instead of `scanf`: The program is using `scanf` for input. We can use `cin` which is faster and more efficient. We need to include the `<iostream>` header file for using `cin` and `cout`. Therefore, we can replace `scanf("%d", &n);` with `cin >> n;` and `scanf("%d", &S[i]);` with `cin >> S[i];`.

4. Use `binary_search` algorithm: Instead of implementing the binary search algorithm manually, we can use the `binary_search` algorithm provided by the C++ Standard Library. This will simplify the code and make it more efficient. We need to include the `<algorithm>` header file for using `binary_search`. Therefore, we can replace the while loop with the following code:

```cpp
if (binary_search(S, S + n, T)) {
    ++cnt;
}
```

5. Remove unnecessary variable assignments: The variable `mid` is assigned a value before entering the while loop, but it is reassigned inside the loop. We can remove the initial assignment `int mid = (right + left) / 2;` as it is not needed.

6. Optimize the binary search: The binary search can be optimized by changing the condition in the while loop from `left < right` to `left <= right`. This will eliminate the need to reassign `right` when `T < S[mid]`. Therefore, we can replace the while loop condition with `while (left <= right)`.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    int n;
    cin >> n;
    
    int S[n];
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        cin >> S[i];
    }
    
    int cnt = 0;
    int q;
    cin >> q;
    
    for (int i = 0; i < q; ++i) {
        int T;
        cin >> T;
        
        int left = 0;
        int right = n - 1;
        
        while (left <= right) {
            int mid = (right + left) / 2;
            
            if (T > S[mid]) {
                left = mid + 1;
            } else if (T < S[mid]) {
                right = mid - 1;
            } else {
                ++cnt;
                break;
            }
        }
    }
    
    cout << cnt << endl;
    
    return 0;
}
```
