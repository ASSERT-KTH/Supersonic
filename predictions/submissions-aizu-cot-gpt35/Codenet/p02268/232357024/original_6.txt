Step 1: Avoid using the `using namespace std;` directive

The `using namespace std;` directive is generally considered bad practice because it brings all the names from the `std` namespace into the global namespace, which can lead to naming conflicts. Instead, it is better to explicitly qualify the names from the `std` namespace when using them.

Step 2: Use `std::vector` instead of a variable-length array

Using a variable-length array (`int S[n];`) is not standard C++. It is better to use `std::vector` which is a more flexible and safer container.

Step 3: Use `std::cin` and `std::cout` instead of `scanf` and `printf`

`std::cin` and `std::cout` are safer and more idiomatic in C++ compared to `scanf` and `printf`.

Step 4: Optimize the binary search

The binary search can be optimized by checking for equality (`T == S[mid]`) before checking for less than or greater than. This way, we can avoid unnecessary comparisons.

Step 5: Remove unnecessary variable initialization

The variables `left`, `right`, and `mid` can be initialized directly inside the while loop, as their initial values are not used.

Step 6: Move the binary search termination condition check outside the loop

Currently, the termination condition `left < right` is checked at the beginning of each loop iteration. Instead, we can move this check to the end of the loop and use a `do-while` loop.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

int main() {
  int n;
  std::cin >> n;
  std::vector<int> S(n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    std::cin >> S[i];
  }
  int cnt = 0;
  int q;
  std::cin >> q;
  for (int i = 0; i < q; ++i) {
    int T;
    std::cin >> T;
    int left = 0;
    int right = n;
    int mid;
    do {
      mid = (right + left) / 2;
      if (T > S[mid]) {
        left = mid + 1;
      } else if (T == S[mid]) {
        ++cnt;
        break;
      } else {
        right = mid;
      }
    } while (left < right);
  }
  std::cout << cnt << std::endl;
  return 0;
}
```
