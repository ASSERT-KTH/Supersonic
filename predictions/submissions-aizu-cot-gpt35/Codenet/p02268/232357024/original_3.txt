This program is performing a binary search on an array to count the number of occurrences of certain elements. Here are the steps to optimize the program:

1. Remove the unnecessary inclusion of `<cstdio>` and `<iostream>` headers as they are not used in the program.

2. Change the `scanf` and `printf` functions to `cin` and `cout` for input and output respectively. This will improve the I/O performance of the program.

3. Use a more efficient method to calculate the middle index `mid` instead of `(right + left) / 2`. This can be done by using `left + (right - left) / 2`.

4. Instead of using an array `S` to store the elements, use a `vector<int>` to dynamically allocate memory. This will avoid the issue of variable-length arrays in C++.

5. Use a `unordered_set<int>` to store the elements of the array `S` for faster lookup. This will replace the binary search loop.

6. Instead of using a separate loop to read the elements of the array `S`, read them directly inside the binary search loop.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_set>

using namespace std;

int main() {
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  vector<int> S(n);
  unordered_set<int> setS;
  
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    cin >> S[i];
    setS.insert(S[i]);
  }
  
  int cnt = 0;
  int q;
  cin >> q;
  
  for (int i = 0; i < q; ++i) {
    int T;
    cin >> T;
    
    if (setS.count(T) > 0) {
      ++cnt;
    }
  }
  
  cout << cnt << endl;
  
  return 0;
}
```
