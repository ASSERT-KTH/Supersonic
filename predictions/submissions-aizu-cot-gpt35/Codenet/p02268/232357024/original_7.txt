The given program is a binary search algorithm that searches for a given value `T` in an array `S`. The program reads an integer `n` as the size of the array, followed by `n` integers as the values of the array. Then it reads an integer `q` as the number of queries, followed by `q` integers as the values to search for in the array. The program outputs the number of queries that match a value in the array.

To optimize this program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Avoid using `namespace std`: Using `using namespace std` is considered bad practice in C++. It can cause naming conflicts and make the code less readable. Instead, we can prefix the standard library classes and functions with `std::`.

2. Use `cin` and `cout` instead of `scanf` and `printf`: The `cin` and `cout` stream classes provide a safer and more efficient way to read and write data compared to `scanf` and `printf`. They also have better type checking.

3. Use `vector` instead of a variable-length array: Variable-length arrays (VLAs) are not standard in C++, although some compilers support them as an extension. Instead of using a VLA, we can use a `std::vector` to store the array `S`. This allows us to dynamically allocate and resize the array as needed.

4. Use the `lower_bound` algorithm: Instead of manually implementing binary search, we can use the `std::lower_bound` algorithm from the `<algorithm>` header. This algorithm returns an iterator to the first element that is not less than the searched value. By comparing the value at the iterator with the searched value, we can determine if it is a match.

5. Use prefix increment operator: Instead of using the postfix increment operator (`++cnt`), we can use the prefix increment operator (`++cnt`) to increment the counter `cnt`. This avoids the creation of a temporary object and is generally more efficient.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

int main() {
  int n;
  std::cin >> n;
  std::vector<int> S(n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    std::cin >> S[i];
  }
  
  int cnt = 0;
  int q;
  std::cin >> q;
  for (int i = 0; i < q; ++i) {
    int T;
    std::cin >> T;
    auto it = std::lower_bound(S.begin(), S.end(), T);
    if (it != S.end() && *it == T) {
      ++cnt;
    }
  }
  
  std::cout << cnt << std::endl;
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized program uses `cin` and `cout` for input and output, replaces the variable-length array with a `std::vector`, and uses `std::lower_bound` for binary search. The prefix increment operator is used to increment the counter `cnt`.
