The given program generates a list of prime numbers up to 1,000,000 and then answers queries about the number of prime numbers up to a given input.

To optimize the program, we can make the following changes:

1. Use a more efficient algorithm for generating prime numbers. The current approach checks divisibility for every number up to the square root of 1,000,000. We can use the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm, which eliminates multiples of primes to generate prime numbers. This algorithm has a time complexity of O(n log log n), which is much faster than the current approach.

2. Remove unnecessary memory usage. The array `num` is currently defined with a size of 1,000,000, even though we only need to store prime numbers up to that limit. We can reduce the size of the array to only store the required prime numbers.

3. Use a more efficient method for calculating the number of prime numbers up to a given input. The current approach iterates over the `num` array and counts the number of non-zero elements. Instead, we can store the cumulative sum of prime numbers in a separate array and directly access the count for a given input.

Here's the optimized program:

```c
#include <math.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdbool.h>

int main() {
  int i, j;
  int n;
  int num[100000];
  bool isPrime[1000000];

  // Use Sieve of Eratosthenes to generate prime numbers
  for (i = 0; i < 1000000; i++) {
    isPrime[i] = true;
  }
  isPrime[0] = isPrime[1] = false;
  for (i = 2; i < sqrt(1000000); i++) {
    if (isPrime[i]) {
      for (j = i * i; j < 1000000; j += i) {
        isPrime[j] = false;
      }
    }
  }

  // Store the prime numbers in num array
  int count = 0;
  for (i = 0; i < 1000000; i++) {
    if (isPrime[i]) {
      num[count++] = i;
    }
  }

  int primeCount[100000];
  primeCount[0] = 0;

  // Calculate the cumulative sum of prime numbers
  for (i = 1; i < count; i++) {
    primeCount[i] = primeCount[i - 1] + 1;
  }

  while (scanf("%d", &n) != EOF) {
    printf("%d\n", primeCount[n]);
  }

  return 0;
}
```

Explanation of the optimization steps:

1. We replaced the prime number generation algorithm with the Sieve of Eratosthenes. This algorithm eliminates multiples of primes to generate prime numbers efficiently. We only need to iterate up to the square root of 1,000,000 to mark all non-prime numbers.

2. We reduced the size of the `num` array to store only the required prime numbers. This saves memory usage.

3. We introduced a new array `primeCount` to store the cumulative sum of prime numbers. This allows us to directly access the count of prime numbers up to a given input, instead of iterating over the `num` array.

These optimizations should significantly improve the running time and memory usage of the program.
