The given program is a prime number generator using the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm. It initializes an array `num` with all elements set to 1, and then iteratively marks multiples of each prime number as non-prime. Finally, it calculates the cumulative sum of the array elements and prints the number of primes less than or equal to a given input number.

To optimize this program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Change the loop condition in the second `for` loop from `i < sqrt(1000000)` to `i * i < 1000000`. This avoids the unnecessary calculation of the square root in each iteration.

2. Change the loop condition in the third `for` loop from `i < 1000000 - 1` to `i < n - 1`, where `n` is the input number. This ensures that we only calculate the cumulative sum up to the given input number.

3. Move the initialization of the `num` array inside the `for` loop that reads input numbers. This allows us to reuse the `num` array for each input number, reducing memory usage.

Here is the optimized program:

```c
#include <math.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  int i, j;
  int n;

  for (; scanf("%d", &n) != EOF;) {
    int num[1000000];
    for (i = 0; i < 1000000; i++) {
      num[i] = 1;
    }
    num[0] = num[1] = 0;
    for (i = 2; i * i < 1000000; i++) {
      if (num[i] == 1) {
        for (j = i * i; j < 1000000; j += i)
          num[j] = 0;
      }
    }
    for (i = 1; i < n - 1; i++) {
      num[i + 1] += num[i];
    }
    printf("%d\n", num[n]);
  }

  return 0;
}
```

By making these optimizations, we have reduced unnecessary calculations and memory usage, resulting in improved performance for both running time and memory usage.
