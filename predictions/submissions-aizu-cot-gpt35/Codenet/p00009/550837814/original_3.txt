Step 1: Remove unnecessary include statements

The program includes the <math.h> library, but it does not use any math-related functions. Therefore, we can remove the line `#include <math.h>`.

Step 2: Reduce the size of the num array

The num array has a size of 1000000, but the program only uses the first 1000000 - 1 elements. We can reduce the size of the array to avoid unnecessary memory usage.

Step 3: Optimize the loop condition

In the second for loop, the condition `i < sqrt(1000000)` is evaluated in every iteration. We can optimize this by calculating the square root outside the loop and storing it in a variable.

Step 4: Optimize the loop iterations

In the second for loop, the loop iterates from `i * i` to 1000000 with a step size of `i`. However, we can optimize this by starting the loop from `i * i` and incrementing `j` by `2 * i` instead of `i` in each iteration. This reduces the number of iterations by half.

Step 5: Remove unnecessary array element initialization

The initial loop that sets all elements of the num array to 1 is unnecessary because the subsequent loop immediately sets num[0] and num[1] to 0. We can remove this loop.

Step 6: Remove unnecessary variable initialization

The variable `n` is not used before it is read from input. We can remove the initialization of `n`.

Here is the optimized program:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  int i, j;
  int n;
  int num[999999];

  num[0] = num[1] = 0;
  for (i = 2; i * i < 1000000; i++) {
    if (num[i] == 1) {
      for (j = i * i; j < 1000000; j += 2 * i)
        num[j] = 0;
    }
  }
  for (i = 1; i < 999999; i++) {
    num[i + 1] += num[i];
  }
  for (; scanf("%d", &n) != EOF;) {
    printf("%d\n", num[n]);
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Explanation:
- Removed unnecessary include statement `#include <math.h>`.
- Reduced the size of the num array to 999999.
- Optimized the loop condition to `i * i < 1000000`.
- Optimized the loop iterations by incrementing `j` by `2 * i`.
- Removed the unnecessary loop that initializes all elements of the num array to 1.
- Removed the unnecessary initialization of the variable `n`.
