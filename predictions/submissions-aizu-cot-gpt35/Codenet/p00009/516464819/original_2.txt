The given program aims to find the number of primes less than or equal to each input number.

To optimize the program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Instead of using a `list` to store the prime numbers, we can use a `vector` since the number of primes is not known in advance and it will avoid the need for dynamic memory allocation.

2. We can eliminate the need for the `inputs` vector by directly calculating the maximum input number while reading the input.

3. Instead of checking if a number is prime by iterating through all the primes, we can use a more efficient algorithm called the Sieve of Eratosthenes. This algorithm marks all the multiples of each prime number as non-prime, reducing the number of iterations needed.

4. Instead of counting the primes for each input number individually, we can count the primes up to the maximum input number and store the counts in a `vector`. Then, we can directly access the count for each input number.

Here's the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <cmath>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

void sieve(int n, vector<bool>& isPrime) {
  isPrime.resize(n + 1, true);
  isPrime[0] = isPrime[1] = false;
  
  for (int i = 2, end = sqrt(n); i <= end; ++i) {
    if (isPrime[i]) {
      for (int j = i * i; j <= n; j += i) {
        isPrime[j] = false;
      }
    }
  }
}

int main() {
  vector<bool> isPrime;
  int maxInput = 0;
  int x;
  
  while (cin >> x) {
    maxInput = max(maxInput, x);
  }
  
  sieve(maxInput, isPrime);
  
  vector<int> countPrimes(maxInput + 1, 0);
  
  for (int i = 2; i <= maxInput; ++i) {
    countPrimes[i] = countPrimes[i - 1] + isPrime[i];
  }
  
  cin.clear();
  cin.seekg(0, ios::beg);
  
  while (cin >> x) {
    cout << countPrimes[x] << endl;
  }
  
  return 0;
}
```

Explanation of the optimization steps:

1. Replaced `list<int> primes` with `vector<bool> isPrime` to store the prime numbers.

2. Removed the `vector<int> inputs` and calculated the maximum input number (`maxInput`) directly while reading the input.

3. Modified the `sieve` function to take a `vector<bool>& isPrime` as a parameter. This vector is resized to `n + 1` and initialized as `true` for all indices. The Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm is then applied to mark the non-prime numbers as `false`.

4. Created a new vector `vector<int> countPrimes` to store the count of primes up to each index. Initialized all counts to 0.

5. Modified the second loop to calculate the count of primes up to each index. Starting from index 2, the count is calculated by adding the previous count with the boolean value of `isPrime[i]`.

6. Added `cin.clear()` and `cin.seekg(0, ios::beg)` to reset the input stream before the second loop to read the input numbers again.

Overall, these optimizations reduce the runtime complexity from O(n * sqrt(n)) to O(n * log(log(n))) and improve memory usage by eliminating unnecessary dynamic memory allocation.
