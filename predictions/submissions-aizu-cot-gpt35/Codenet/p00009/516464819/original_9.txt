The given program calculates the number of primes less than or equal to each input number and prints the count for each input. 

To optimize the program for running time and memory usage, we can make the following modifications:

1. Instead of using a `list` to store the primes, we can use a `vector`. A `vector` has better performance characteristics for random access and memory usage compared to a `list`.

2. Instead of using a `list` or `vector` to store the inputs, we can process each input number one by one as we read them from the input stream. This will reduce the memory usage as we don't need to store all the input numbers in memory.

3. We can remove the `using namespace std;` statement and explicitly qualify the standard library types and functions with `std::` to avoid namespace pollution.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <cmath>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

void sieve(int n, std::vector<int>& primes) {
  std::vector<bool> v(n + 1, true);
  for (int i = 3, end = std::sqrt(n); i <= end; i += 2) {
    if (!v[i])
      continue;
    for (int j = i * i, skip = i * 2; j <= n; j += skip)
      v[j] = false;
  }
  primes.push_back(2);
  for (int i = 3; i <= n; i += 2)
    if (v[i])
      primes.push_back(i);
}

int main() {
  std::vector<int> primes;
  int x;
  while (std::cin >> x) {
    sieve(x, primes);
    int count = 0;
    for (auto p : primes) {
      if (p == x) {
        count++;
        break;
      } else if (p > x) {
        break;
      } else {
        count++;
      }
    }
    std::cout << count << std::endl;
    primes.clear();
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Explanation of optimizations:
1. Replaced `list<int>` with `vector<int>` for storing primes. This improves performance for random access and reduces memory usage.

2. Removed the `vector<int> inputs` and the loop for storing inputs. Instead, we read each input number one by one from the input stream and directly process it.

3. Removed the `using namespace std;` statement to avoid namespace pollution and explicitly qualified standard library types and functions with `std::`.

4. Added `primes.clear()` to clear the vector of primes after processing each input number. This ensures that the vector is empty before calculating primes for the next input.
