The given program generates a list of prime numbers up to a given number and counts the number of prime numbers less than or equal to each number in a given list of inputs. 

To optimize the program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Instead of using a `list<int>` to store the prime numbers, we can use a `vector<int>` which has a faster access time due to contiguous memory allocation.
2. Instead of iterating through the `primes` vector to count the number of primes less than or equal to each number, we can use the `lower_bound` function from the `<algorithm>` library to find the first prime number greater than each number. The difference between the iterator returned by `lower_bound` and the beginning of the `primes` vector will give us the count of prime numbers less than or equal to each number.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <cmath>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

void sieve(int n, vector<int>& primes) {
  vector<bool> v(n + 1, true);
  for (int i = 3, end = sqrt(n); i <= end; i += 2) {
    if (!v[i])
      continue;
    for (int j = i * i, skip = i * 2; j <= n; j += skip)
      v[j] = false;
  }
  primes.push_back(2);
  for (int i = 3; i <= n; i += 2)
    if (v[i])
      primes.push_back(i);
}

int main() {
  vector<int> primes;
  vector<int> inputs;
  for (int x; cin >> x;)
    inputs.push_back(x);
  sieve(*max_element(inputs.begin(), inputs.end()), primes);
  for (auto x : inputs) {
    int count = lower_bound(primes.begin(), primes.end(), x + 1) - primes.begin();
    cout << count << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Explanation of the optimization:
1. Changed `list<int> primes` to `vector<int> primes` to improve memory access time.
2. Replaced the inner loop in the main function with a call to `lower_bound`, which finds the first element greater than `x` in the `primes` vector. The difference between this iterator and the beginning of the `primes` vector gives us the count of primes less than or equal to `x`.
