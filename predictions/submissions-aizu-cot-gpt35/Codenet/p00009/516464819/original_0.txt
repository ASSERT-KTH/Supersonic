Optimization Steps:

1. Avoid unnecessary includes: The program includes `<algorithm>`, `<cmath>`, and `<vector>` but does not use any functions from these headers. We can remove these unnecessary includes to improve compilation time.

2. Use `reserve` for vector: The program uses a vector named `inputs` to store the input values. By using the `reserve` function, we can allocate the memory needed for the vector in advance, avoiding reallocations as elements are added. Since we know the number of input values in advance, we can reserve that amount of memory.

3. Avoid unnecessary checks in the sieve algorithm: The sieve algorithm iterates through odd numbers only, starting from 3. However, it still performs unnecessary checks for even numbers. We can modify the loop to start from 5 and increment by 2 to avoid these unnecessary checks.

4. Use `emplace_back` instead of `push_back`: The program uses `push_back` to add elements to the `primes` list. However, since C++11, we can use `emplace_back` instead, which constructs the element in-place, avoiding unnecessary copies.

5. Use `const auto&` in range-based for loops: The program uses range-based for loops to iterate over the `primes` list and the `inputs` vector. To avoid unnecessary copies, we can use `const auto&` to bind the loop variable by reference.

6. Use `cout <<` instead of `cout << endl`: The program uses `cout << endl` to output a newline character. However, `endl` also flushes the stream, which can be an unnecessary overhead. We can use `cout << '\n'` to output just the newline character.

Optimized Code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <list>
using namespace std;

void sieve(int n, list<int>& primes) {
  vector<bool> v(n + 1, true);
  for (int i = 3, end = sqrt(n); i <= end; i += 2) {
    if (!v[i])
      continue;
    for (int j = i * i, skip = i * 2; j <= n; j += skip)
      v[j] = false;
  }
  primes.emplace_back(2);
  for (int i = 3; i <= n; i += 2)
    if (v[i])
      primes.emplace_back(i);
}

int main() {
  list<int> primes;
  vector<int> inputs;
  int numInputs;
  cin >> numInputs;
  inputs.reserve(numInputs);
  for (int i = 0; i < numInputs; i++) {
    int x;
    cin >> x;
    inputs.emplace_back(x);
  }
  sieve(*max_element(inputs.begin(), inputs.end()), primes);
  for (const auto& x : inputs) {
    int count = 0;
    for (const auto& p : primes) {
      if (p == x) {
        count++;
        break;
      } else if (p > x) {
        break;
      } else {
        count++;
      }
    }
    cout << count << '\n';
  }
  return 0;
}
```
