Step 1: Remove unnecessary includes
- The program includes `<algorithm>`, `<cmath>`, and `<vector>`, but these headers are not used in the program. We can remove them to reduce unnecessary overhead.

Step 2: Use `reserve` for vector inputs
- The program uses a vector to store the inputs. By using the `reserve` function, we can preallocate memory for the vector, reducing the need for reallocation and improving memory usage.

Step 3: Use a `set` for primes instead of a `list`
- The program uses a `list` to store the prime numbers. However, searching for primes in a `list` is less efficient compared to a `set` due to the linear search time complexity of a `list`. By using a `set`, we can take advantage of its logarithmic search time complexity.

Step 4: Use `lower_bound` instead of a loop for counting primes
- The program currently uses a loop to count the number of primes that are less than or equal to the input number. However, we can use the `lower_bound` function from the `set` to find the position of the first prime greater than the input number. The difference between the iterator returned by `lower_bound` and the beginning of the `set` will give us the count of primes.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <cmath>
#include <iostream>
#include <list>
#include <set>
using namespace std;

void sieve(int n, set<int>& primes) {
  vector<bool> v(n + 1, true);
  for (int i = 3, end = sqrt(n); i <= end; i += 2) {
    if (!v[i])
      continue;
    for (int j = i * i, skip = i * 2; j <= n; j += skip)
      v[j] = false;
  }
  primes.insert(2);
  for (int i = 3; i <= n; i += 2)
    if (v[i])
      primes.insert(i);
}

int main() {
  list<int> primes;
  primes.reserve(100000);
  set<int> inputs;
  int x;
  while (cin >> x)
    inputs.insert(x);
  sieve(*inputs.rbegin(), primes);
  for (auto x : inputs) {
    int count = distance(primes.begin(), primes.lower_bound(x));
    cout << count << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Note: I have made a few additional optimizations to the code:
- Changed the type of `inputs` from `vector` to `set` for efficient insertion and unique element storage.
- Used `inputs.rbegin()` to find the maximum input value instead of `max_element(inputs.begin(), inputs.end())`.
- Used the `distance` function to calculate the count of primes instead of manually counting using a loop.
