Step 1: Remove unnecessary headers
- The program includes the `<list>` header, but it is not used. Therefore, we can remove it to optimize memory usage.

Step 2: Avoid unnecessary calculations
- In the `sieve` function, we can avoid unnecessary calculations by iterating only up to `end` instead of `n`.
- We can also optimize the inner loop by starting from `i*i` instead of `i` and incrementing by `i*2` each time.
- This will reduce the number of iterations and improve the program's running time.

Step 3: Use a more efficient data structure
- The `list<int>` container is used to store the prime numbers. However, using a `vector<int>` would be more efficient in terms of both memory usage and performance.

Step 4: Avoid unnecessary iterations
- In the main loop, we iterate over all the prime numbers for each input number. However, we can stop iterating as soon as we find a prime number greater than the input number.
- This will reduce the number of iterations and improve the program's running time.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <cmath>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

void sieve(int n, vector<int> &primes) {
  vector<bool> v(n + 1, true);
  for (int i = 3, end = sqrt(n); i <= end; i += 2) {
    if (!v[i])
      continue;
    for (int j = i * i, skip = i * 2; j <= n; j += skip)
      v[j] = false;
  }
  primes.push_back(2);
  for (int i = 3; i <= n; i += 2)
    if (v[i])
      primes.push_back(i);
}

int main() {
  vector<int> primes;
  vector<int> inputs;
  for (int x; cin >> x;)
    inputs.push_back(x);
  sieve(*max_element(inputs.begin(), inputs.end()), primes);
  for (auto x : inputs) {
    int count = 0;
    for (auto p : primes) {
      if (p == x) {
        count++;
        break;
      } else if (p > x) {
        break;
      } else {
        count++;
      }
    }
    cout << count << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```
