The given program generates a list of prime numbers using the sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm and then counts the number of prime numbers less than or equal to each input number. 

To optimize the program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Avoid unnecessary calculations in the sieve function by optimizing the inner loop that marks non-prime numbers. We can start marking non-prime numbers from `i * i` instead of `2 * i`. This is because all the numbers less than `i * i` will already be marked as non-prime by smaller prime numbers.

2. Avoid unnecessary calculations in the main loop that counts the number of prime numbers less than or equal to each input number. We can terminate the loop as soon as we find a prime number greater than the input number, as the prime numbers are stored in increasing order.

3. Use a more efficient data structure to store the list of prime numbers. Instead of using a list, we can use a vector, as the vector provides better random access performance.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <cmath>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

void sieve(int n, vector<int>& primes) {
  vector<bool> v(n + 1, true);
  for (int i = 3, end = sqrt(n); i <= end; i += 2) {
    if (!v[i])
      continue;
    for (int j = i * i, skip = i * 2; j <= n; j += skip)
      v[j] = false;
  }
  primes.push_back(2);
  for (int i = 3; i <= n; i += 2)
    if (v[i])
      primes.push_back(i);
}

int main() {
  vector<int> primes;
  vector<int> inputs;
  for (int x; cin >> x;)
    inputs.push_back(x);
  
  sieve(*max_element(inputs.begin(), inputs.end()), primes);
  
  for (auto x : inputs) {
    int count = 0;
    for (auto p : primes) {
      if (p > x)
        break;
      count++;
    }
    cout << count << endl;
  }
  
  return 0;
}
```

Explanation of optimizations:

1. We modified the sieve function to start marking non-prime numbers from `i * i` instead of `2 * i`. This reduces the number of iterations in the inner loop and avoids unnecessary calculations.

2. We modified the main loop to terminate as soon as we find a prime number greater than the input number. This reduces the number of iterations in the inner loop and avoids unnecessary calculations.

3. We changed the data structure used to store the list of prime numbers from list to vector. Vectors provide better random access performance, which is more suitable for this program.
