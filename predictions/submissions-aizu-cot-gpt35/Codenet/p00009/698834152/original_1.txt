The given program calculates the number of prime numbers up to a given number `n`. It uses the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to mark all non-prime numbers and counts the number of prime numbers using a prefix sum array.

To optimize this program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove the unnecessary `using namespace std` directive.

2. Use a more descriptive variable name instead of `MAX`. For example, `N` can be used to represent the maximum number.

3. Use a more efficient data type for the `not_prime_flag` array. Instead of using a `bool` array, we can use a `vector<bool>` which is optimized for space efficiency.

4. Instead of using a prefix sum array `num_prime`, we can directly calculate the count of prime numbers on the fly while marking the non-prime numbers in the `not_prime_flag` array.

5. Avoid performing unnecessary calculations by starting the inner loop of the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm from `i*i` instead of `2*i`. This is because all multiples of `i` less than `i*i` would have already been marked by previous iterations.

6. Use a more efficient input/output method than `cin` and `cout`. For example, we can use `scanf` and `printf` which are faster for reading and writing integers.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <cstdio>

int main() {
    const int N = 999999;
    std::vector<bool> not_prime_flag(N + 1, false);
    int count = 0;
    
    for (int i = 2; i <= N; ++i) {
        if (!not_prime_flag[i]) {
            ++count;
            for (int j = i * i; j <= N; j += i) {
                not_prime_flag[j] = true;
            }
        }
    }
    
    int n;
    while (std::scanf("%d", &n) == 1) {
        std::printf("%d\n", count);
    }
    
    return 0;
}
```

Explanation of the optimizations:

1. Removing the `using namespace std` directive is considered a best practice to avoid potential naming conflicts.

2. Using a more descriptive variable name, such as `N`, makes the code more readable and easier to understand.

3. Using `vector<bool>` for the `not_prime_flag` array saves memory compared to a regular `bool` array. The `vector<bool>` specialization uses a more compact representation, typically as a bit array.

4. By directly calculating the count of prime numbers on the fly while marking the non-prime numbers, we avoid the need for a separate prefix sum array.

5. Starting the inner loop of the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm from `i*i` instead of `2*i` reduces the number of iterations, improving the performance.

6. Using `scanf` and `printf` for input/output operations is faster than using `cin` and `cout` for handling large amounts of input/output data.
