The given program calculates the number of fields formed by a set of line segments on a 2D plane. The program reads the number of line segments, the coordinates of their starting and ending points, and then calculates the number of fields formed.

To optimize the program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary headers: The program includes several unnecessary headers (`<algorithm>`, `<cassert>`, `<cmath>`, `<cstdio>`, `<iostream>`) that are not used. We can remove these headers to improve compilation time.

2. Remove unnecessary macros: The program defines several unnecessary macros (`EPS`, `F`, `S`, `COUNTER_CLOCKWISE`, `CLOCKWISE`, `ONLINE_BACK`, `ONLINE_FRONT`, `ON_SEGMENT`) that are not used. We can remove these macros to simplify the code.

3. Remove unnecessary operator overloads: The struct `P` has unnecessary operator overloads (`operator*`, `operator/`). We can remove these operator overloads to simplify the code.

4. Simplify the `operator<` implementation: The `operator<` implementation in struct `P` can be simplified by directly comparing the x and y coordinates using `<` operator. We don't need to use `fabs` for comparison.

5. Optimize the `isIntersect` function: The `isIntersect` function can be optimized by removing the unnecessary checks and calculations. We can simplify the condition to check if the cross products of the segments have different signs. This will determine if the segments intersect. We don't need to perform additional checks using `ccw` function.

6. Optimize the `crosspoint` function: The `crosspoint` function can be optimized by removing the unnecessary calculations. We don't need to calculate the value of `A` and `B` separately. We can directly calculate `pro` using cross product and perform the scaling in a single step.

7. Optimize the loop for checking existing points: The loop for checking existing points can be optimized by using `std::set` instead of a vector. This will eliminate the need for linear searching and improve the performance.

8. Rename variables for clarity: Some variable names in the program are unclear (`xx`, `yy`, `xxx`, `yyy`). We can rename these variables to improve code readability.

Here is the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <set>

#define EPS 1e-10

struct Point {
  double x, y;
  Point(double x = 0, double y = 0) : x(x), y(y) {}
  Point operator+(const Point& p) const { return Point(x + p.x, y + p.y); }
  Point operator-(const Point& p) const { return Point(x - p.x, y - p.y); }
  bool operator==(const Point& p) const { return (x == p.x && y == p.y); }
  bool operator<(const Point& p) const { return x < p.x || (x == p.x && y < p.y); }
};

typedef std::pair<Point, Point> Segment;

double cross(const Point& a, const Point& b) { return a.x * b.y - a.y * b.x; }

bool isIntersect(const Point& p1, const Point& p2, const Point& p3, const Point& p4) {
  return cross(p2 - p1, p3 - p1) * cross(p2 - p1, p4 - p1) < -EPS &&
         cross(p4 - p3, p1 - p3) * cross(p4 - p3, p2 - p3) < -EPS;
}

Point crosspoint(const Point& p1, const Point& p2, const Point& p3, const Point& p4) {
  double A = cross(p2 - p1, p4 - p3);
  Point pro = cross(p2 - p1, p2 - p3);
  pro.x *= (pro.x / A);
  pro.y *= (pro.y / A);
  return p3 + pro;
}

int main() {
  int n;
  while (std::cin >> n && n) {
    int field = 1;
    std::vector<Segment> segments;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      int x1, y1, x2, y2;
      std::cin >> x1 >> y1 >> x2 >> y2;
      segments.push_back({Point(x1, y1), Point(x2, y2)});
      int x_counter = 0;
      std::set<Point> existingPoints;
      for (int j = 0; j < i; j++) {
        if (isIntersect(segments[j].first, segments[j].second, segments[i].first, segments[i].second)) {
          Point xp = crosspoint(segments[j].first, segments[j].second, segments[i].first, segments[i].second);
          if (100 - std::abs(xp.x) < EPS || 100 - std::abs(xp.y) < EPS)
            continue;
          if (existingPoints.count(xp) == 0) {
            x_counter++;
            existingPoints.insert(xp);
          }
        }
      }
      field += x_counter + 1;
    }
    std::cout << field << std::endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```
