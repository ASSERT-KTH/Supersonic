The given program calculates the maximum time required for a robot to reach a set of points. 

To optimize the program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary header files: The `<algorithm>` and `<cstdio>` headers are not used in the program and can be removed.

2. Remove unused variables: The variables `x` and `y` are not used after being read from input and can be removed.

3. Avoid unnecessary calculations: In the `add` function, the `abs` function is called twice for `a` and `b` which can be avoided by storing the absolute values in variables before the comparison.

4. Avoid unnecessary calculations: In the `dist` function, the `pow` function is used to calculate the square of the differences between `a.x` and `b.x`, and `a.y` and `b.y`. We can optimize this by directly multiplying the differences instead.

5. Avoid unnecessary calculations: In the `main` function, the `dist` function is called twice for the same input parameters in the inner loop. We can optimize this by storing the distance in a variable and reusing it.

6. Avoid unnecessary calculations: In the inner loop of the `main` function, the `dist` function is called multiple times for the same input parameters. We can optimize this by storing the distance in a variable before the loop and reusing it.

7. Avoid unnecessary calculations: In the inner loop of the `main` function, the `dist` function is called twice for the same input parameters in the condition and the assignment. We can optimize this by storing the distance in a variable before the loop and reusing it.

Here is the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <cmath>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

double EPS = 1e-6;

double add(double a, double b) {
  double abs_a = abs(a);
  double abs_b = abs(b);
  if (abs(a + b) < EPS * (abs_a + abs_b))
    return 0;
  return a + b;
}

struct point {
  double x, y;
  point() {}
  point(double x, double y) : x(x), y(y) {}
  point operator+(point p) { return point(add(x, p.x), add(y, p.y)); }
  point operator-(point p) { return point(add(x, -p.x), add(y, -p.y)); }
  point operator*(double d) { return point(x * d, y * d); }
  point operator/(double d) { return point(x / d, y / d); }
};

double dist(point a, point b) {
  double dx = a.x - b.x;
  double dy = a.y - b.y;
  return sqrt(dx * dx + dy * dy);
}

int main(void) {
  int n, v;
  vector<point> P;
  vector<double> V;
  while (cin >> n, n) {
    P.clear();
    V.clear();
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      point p;
      cin >> p.x >> p.y >> v;
      P.push_back(p);
      V.push_back(v);
    }
    double r = 0.98;
    point now(0, 0);
    for (double d = 10; d > EPS; d *= r) {
      int mx = 0;
      double mxd = 0;
      for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
        double d = dist(now, P[j]);
        double div = d / V[j];
        if (div > mxd) {
          mx = j;
          mxd = div;
        }
      }
      point diff = P[mx] - now;
      double norm = dist(P[mx], now);
      diff = diff / norm * d;
      now = now + diff;
    }
    double ans = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      double d = dist(now, P[i]);
      double div = d / V[i];
      ans = max(ans, div);
    }
    printf("%.8f\n", ans);
  }
  return 0;
}
