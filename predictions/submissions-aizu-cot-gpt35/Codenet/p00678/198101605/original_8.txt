The given program calculates the maximum time taken to reach a set of points from the origin, given the velocity of each point. The program works correctly, but it can be optimized for both running time and memory usage.

Here are the step-by-step optimizations:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The program includes several unnecessary header files such as `<algorithm>`, `<cmath>`, and `<vector>`. Since these headers are not used, we can remove them to improve compilation time.

2. Avoid unnecessary calculations: The `add` function is used to add two double values, but it also performs a check to determine if the result is close to zero based on a small epsilon value. This check is unnecessary and can be removed to improve running time.

3. Use `const` references for function parameters: The `dist` function takes two `point` objects as parameters. Since these objects are not modified within the function, we can pass them as `const` references instead of by value to avoid unnecessary copying.

4. Use range-based for loops: The program uses a traditional `for` loop to iterate over the elements of a vector. We can use a range-based for loop to simplify the code and improve readability.

5. Remove unnecessary variable initialization: The `point` constructor is called with default arguments, which initialize the `x` and `y` members to zero. Since these members are immediately overwritten in the loop, the default constructor is unnecessary and can be removed.

6. Use `emplace_back` instead of `push_back`: Instead of using `push_back` to add elements to the vector, we can use `emplace_back` to construct the objects in-place, avoiding unnecessary copies.

7. Use a constant reference for the `point` object in the `dist` function: The `dist` function takes two `point` objects as parameters. Since these objects are not modified within the function, we can pass them as constant references instead of by value to avoid unnecessary copying.

8. Use `std::max_element` instead of manual loop: The loop in the `main` function that finds the maximum distance can be replaced with `std::max_element` to simplify the code.

9. Use `std::cout` instead of `printf`: The program uses `printf` to print the result. We can use `std::cout` instead to improve consistency and readability.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

struct point {
  double x, y;
};

double dist(const point& a, const point& b) {
  return sqrt((a.x - b.x) * (a.x - b.x) + (a.y - b.y) * (a.y - b.y));
}

int main(void) {
  int n, x, y, v;
  std::vector<point> P;
  std::vector<double> V;
  while (std::cin >> n, n) {
    P.clear();
    V.clear();
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      std::cin >> x >> y >> v;
      P.emplace_back(point{x, y});
      V.emplace_back(v);
    }
    double r = 0.98;
    point now{0, 0};
    for (double d = 10; d > 1e-6; d *= r) {
      auto it = std::max_element(P.begin(), P.end(), [&](const point& a, const point& b) {
        return dist(now, a) / V[&a - &P[0]] < dist(now, b) / V[&b - &P[0]];
      });
      now.x += (it->x - now.x) / dist(*it, now) * d;
      now.y += (it->y - now.y) / dist(*it, now) * d;
    }
    double ans = 0;
    for (const auto& p : P) {
      ans = std::max(ans, dist(now, p) / V[&p - &P[0]]);
    }
    std::cout.precision(8);
    std::cout << std::fixed << ans << "\n";
  }
  return 0;
}
```
