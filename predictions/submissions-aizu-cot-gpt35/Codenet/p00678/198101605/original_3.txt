To optimize the given C/C++ program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The program includes the `<algorithm>` header, but it is not being used. We can remove this include to reduce unnecessary compile-time overhead.

2. Avoid unnecessary vector clearing: In the main loop, the program clears the vectors `P` and `V` in each iteration. However, this is not necessary since the vectors are populated anew in each iteration. We can remove the `P.clear()` and `V.clear()` statements.

3. Optimize the `add` function: The `add` function currently checks for a very small value (`EPS * (abs(a) + abs(b))`) to determine if the sum of `a` and `b` is close to zero. Instead, we can check if the absolute value of the sum is smaller than `EPS`. This avoids the unnecessary multiplication and addition.

4. Optimize the `dist` function: The `dist` function currently calculates the square root of the sum of squares of differences. However, we can avoid the square root calculation by comparing the squared distances instead. This can improve performance since calculating the square root is an expensive operation.

Here is the optimized C++ program:

```cpp
#include <cmath>
#include <cstdio>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

double EPS = 1e-6;

double add(double a, double b) {
  if (abs(a + b) < EPS)
    return 0;
  return a + b;
}

struct point {
  double x, y;
  point() {}
  point(double x, double y) : x(x), y(y) {}
  point operator+(point p) { return point(add(x, p.x), add(y, p.y)); }
  point operator-(point p) { return point(add(x, -p.x), add(y, -p.y)); }
  point operator*(double d) { return point(x * d, y * d); }
  point operator/(double d) { return point(x / d, y / d); }
};

double dist(point a, point b) {
  return (a.x - b.x) * (a.x - b.x) + (a.y - b.y) * (a.y - b.y);
}

int main(void) {
  int n, x, y, v;
  vector<point> P;
  vector<double> V;
  while (cin >> n, n) {
    P.resize(n);
    V.resize(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      cin >> x >> y >> v;
      P[i] = point(x, y);
      V[i] = v;
    }
    double r = 0.98;
    point now(0, 0);
    for (double d = 10; d > EPS; d *= r) {
      int mx = 0;
      double mxd = 0;
      for (int j = 0; j < n; j++)
        if (dist(now, P[j]) / V[j] > mxd)
          mx = j, mxd = dist(now, P[j]) / V[j];
      now = now + ((P[mx] - now) / sqrt(dist(P[mx], now)) * d);
    }
    double ans = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      ans = max(ans, dist(now, P[i]) / V[i]);
    }
    printf("%.8f\n", sqrt(ans));
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Explanation of optimizations:

1. Removed unnecessary includes: We removed the `<algorithm>` header since it is not being used in the program. This avoids unnecessary compile-time overhead.

2. Avoided unnecessary vector clearing: We removed the `P.clear()` and `V.clear()` statements in the main loop since the vectors are populated anew in each iteration. This improves performance by avoiding unnecessary vector clearing.

3. Optimized the `add` function: We modified the `add` function to check if the absolute value of the sum of `a` and `b` is smaller than `EPS` instead of using the more complex calculation. This simplification improves performance.

4. Optimized the `dist` function: We modified the `dist` function to calculate the squared distance between two points instead of calculating the square root of the sum of squares of differences. This avoids the expensive square root calculation and improves performance.

Overall, these optimizations aim to reduce unnecessary operations and improve the efficiency of the program.
