The given program is implementing merge sort to sort an array of integers. Here are the steps to optimize the program:

1. Remove the unnecessary global variables `n1`, `n2`, `i`, `j`, `k`. These variables are only used within the merge function, so they can be declared as local variables inside the function.

2. Instead of using a global variable `count` to keep track of the number of inversions, we can pass it as a parameter to the merge function and update it locally.

3. In the merge function, there is no need to copy the elements from the original array to separate Left and Right arrays. We can directly access the elements from the original array using the indices.

4. In the merge function, instead of using `MAX` as a sentinel value, we can use the maximum value of an integer (`INT_MAX`) from the `<limits.h>` header file.

5. Change the division operator `/` to the right shift operator `>>` to calculate the midpoint. This is a more efficient way to divide an integer by 2.

6. Use a pointer to pass the array `S` to the `mergesort` function, instead of passing it by value. This avoids unnecessary copying of the array.

Here is the optimized program:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <limits.h>

void mergesort(int *, int, int, int*);
void merge(int *, int, int, int, int*);

int main(void) {
    int n;
    scanf("%d", &n);

    int S[n];
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
        scanf("%d", &S[i]);

    int count = 0;
    mergesort(S, 0, n, &count);

    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        printf("%d", S[i]);
        if (i != n - 1)
            printf(" ");
    }
    printf("\n%d\n", count);

    return 0;
}

void mergesort(int *S, int left, int right, int *count) {
    if (left + 1 < right) {
        int mid = (left + right) >> 1;
        mergesort(S, left, mid, count);
        mergesort(S, mid, right, count);
        merge(S, left, mid, right, count);
    }
}

void merge(int *S, int left, int mid, int right, int *count) {
    int n1 = mid - left;
    int n2 = right - mid;

    int Left[n1];
    int Right[n2];

    for (int i = 0; i < n1; i++)
        Left[i] = S[left + i];
    for (int i = 0; i < n2; i++)
        Right[i] = S[mid + i];

    Left[n1] = Right[n2] = INT_MAX;

    int i = 0;
    int j = 0;
    int k = left;

    while (k < right) {
        if (Left[j] > Right[i]) {
            S[k++] = Right[i++];
            *count += n1 - j;
        } else {
            S[k++] = Left[j++];
        }
    }
}
```

In this optimized version of the program, we have made the following changes:
- Removed unnecessary global variables and made them local variables where required.
- Changed the sentinel value from `MAX` to `INT_MAX`.
- Replaced the division operator with the right shift operator to calculate the midpoint.
- Used a pointer to pass the array to avoid unnecessary copying.
- Passed the `count` variable as a parameter to the merge function and updated it locally.
