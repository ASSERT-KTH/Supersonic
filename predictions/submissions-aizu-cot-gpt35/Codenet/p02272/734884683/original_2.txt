Optimization steps:

1. Avoid unnecessary copying of vectors: In the `merge` function, the vectors `L` and `R` are assigned to subarrays of `A` using the `assign` function. This creates unnecessary copies of the subarrays. Instead, we can use pointers to refer to the subarrays without copying the data.

2. Unnecessary static variables: The variables `compared`, `L`, and `R` are declared as static variables. This means that they are shared across multiple function calls and retain their values between calls. However, they are only used within the `main` function and do not need to retain their values between calls. Therefore, we can remove the `static` keyword and declare them as local variables within the `main` function.

3. Avoid unnecessary assignment of UINT32_MAX: In the `merge` function, the sentinel values `UINT32_MAX` are assigned to the last elements of the `L` and `R` vectors. However, this assignment is unnecessary because those elements are never accessed. We can remove these assignments to save memory.

4. Use pointer arithmetic instead of indexing: In the `merge` function, the elements of `L` and `R` vectors are accessed using indexing (`L[i]` and `R[j]`). This involves the overhead of checking array bounds. We can use pointer arithmetic instead to directly access the elements, which can be faster.

5. Use `reserve` function to allocate memory: In the `main` function, the vector `A` is resized to `n` elements. However, we know the size of `A` in advance, so we can use the `reserve` function to allocate memory for `n` elements. This can save memory and improve performance by avoiding unnecessary reallocations.

Optimized program:

```cpp
#include <cstdint>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

static void inputArray(uint32_t A[], int num) {
  for (int i = 0; i < num; i++) {
    cin >> A[i];
  }
}

static void printArray(uint32_t A[], int num) {
  for (int i = 0; i < num; i++) {
    cout << (i != 0 ? " " : "") << A[i];
  }
  cout << endl;
}

static inline void merge(uint32_t A[], uint32_t left, uint32_t mid,
                         uint32_t right) {
  uint32_t n1 = mid - left;
  uint32_t n2 = right - mid;
  vector<uint32_t> L;
  vector<uint32_t> R;
  L.reserve(n1);
  R.reserve(n2);
  for (uint32_t i = 0; i < n1; i++) {
    L.push_back(A[left + i]);
  }
  for (uint32_t j = 0; j < n2; j++) {
    R.push_back(A[mid + j]);
  }
  uint32_t* pL = &L[0];
  uint32_t* pR = &R[0];
  uint32_t* pA = &A[left];
  uint32_t* pLend = pL + n1;
  uint32_t* pRend = pR + n2;
  while (pL < pLend && pR < pRend) {
    if (*pL <= *pR) {
      *pA = *pL;
      pL++;
    } else {
      *pA = *pR;
      pR++;
    }
    pA++;
  }
  while (pL < pLend) {
    *pA = *pL;
    pL++;
    pA++;
  }
  while (pR < pRend) {
    *pA = *pR;
    pR++;
    pA++;
  }
}

static inline void mergeSort(uint32_t A[], uint32_t left, uint32_t right) {
  if (left + 1 < right) {
    uint32_t mid = (left + right) / 2;
    mergeSort(A, left, mid);
    mergeSort(A, mid, right);
    merge(A, left, mid, right);
  }
}

int main() {
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  vector<uint32_t> A;
  A.reserve(n);
  inputArray(&A[0], n);
  mergeSort(&A[0], 0, n);
  printArray(&A[0], n);
  vector<uint32_t>().swap(A);
  return 0;
}
