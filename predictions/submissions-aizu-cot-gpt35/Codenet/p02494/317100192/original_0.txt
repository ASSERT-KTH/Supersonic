The given program reads two integers `h` and `w` from the user, and then prints a rectangle of `h` rows and `w` columns consisting of the character '#'. It continues to read new values of `h` and `w` until the user inputs `0` for both `h` and `w`.

To optimize the program, we can eliminate the unnecessary use of `std::stringstream`. Instead of storing the entire rectangle in a `std::stringstream` and then printing it using `std::cout`, we can directly print each row of the rectangle.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

auto main() -> int {
  int h, w;
  while (std::cin >> h >> w && (h != 0 || w != 0)) {
    for (int y = 0; y < h; ++y) {
      for (int x = 0; x < w; ++x) {
        std::cout << '#';
      }
      std::cout << '\n';
    }
    std::cout << std::endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Explanation:
1. We replace the infinite loop `for (;;) { ... }` with a `while` loop and use the condition `std::cin >> h >> w && (h != 0 || w != 0)` to check if `h` and `w` are both not zero before continuing the loop.
2. Instead of using `std::stringstream` to store the rectangle, we directly print each row of the rectangle using `std::cout`.
3. We remove the unnecessary inclusion of `<algorithm>` header as it is not used in the program.
