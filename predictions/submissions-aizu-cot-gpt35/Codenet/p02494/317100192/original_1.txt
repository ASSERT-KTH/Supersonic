The given program reads two integers `h` and `w` from the user and prints a rectangle of `#` characters with height `h` and width `w`. The program continues to read and print rectangles until the user enters `0` for both `h` and `w`.

To optimize the program, we can eliminate the use of `std::stringstream` and instead directly print the rectangle using a loop.

Here are the step-by-step optimizations:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The `algorithm` header is not used in the program, so we can remove it.

2. Use a single loop to print the rectangle: Instead of using a `stringstream` to accumulate the characters and then printing them, we can directly print the characters in a loop.

3. Use `'\n'` instead of `std::endl`: The use of `std::endl` flushes the output buffer, which can be expensive. We can use `'\n'` to print a newline character instead.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

auto main() -> int {
  int h, w;
  for (;;) {
    std::cin >> h >> w;
    if (h == 0 && w == 0) {
      break;
    }
    for (int y = 0; y < h; ++y) {
      for (int x = 0; x < w; ++x) {
        std::cout << '#';
      }
      std::cout << '\n';
    }
    std::cout << std::flush;
  }
  return 0;
}
```
