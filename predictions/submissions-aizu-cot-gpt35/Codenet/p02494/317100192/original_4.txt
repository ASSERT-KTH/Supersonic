Explanation of the optimization steps:

1. Remove unnecessary include statements: The `<algorithm>` header is not used in the program, so we can remove it to reduce clutter.

2. Use `'\n'` instead of `std::endl`: The `std::endl` manipulator not only adds a newline character but also flushes the output buffer, which can be an unnecessary overhead. Using `'\n'` directly will only add a newline character without the buffer flushing.

3. Avoid using `std::stringstream` for concatenation: The program currently uses `std::stringstream` to concatenate the '#' characters into a string. This adds unnecessary overhead. Instead, we can directly print the '#' characters using a loop.

4. Avoid using `std::endl` for flushing: The program currently uses `std::endl` to flush the output buffer after printing each frame. This can be an unnecessary overhead. We can flush the output buffer manually once after printing all frames.

5. Use a more efficient loop termination condition: The program currently uses an infinite loop with a `break` statement to terminate the loop when `h` and `w` are both 0. We can simplify this by using a single loop with a termination condition of `h != 0 && w != 0`.

Optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

auto main() -> int {
  int h, w;
  while (std::cin >> h >> w && (h != 0 && w != 0)) {
    for (int y = 0; y < h; ++y) {
      for (int x = 0; x < w; ++x) {
        std::cout << '#';
      }
      std::cout << '\n';
    }
    std::cout << std::flush;
  }
  return 0;
}
```
