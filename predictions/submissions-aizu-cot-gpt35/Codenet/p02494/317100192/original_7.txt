The given program reads two integers `h` and `w` from the user, and then prints a rectangle of `#` characters with height `h` and width `w`. The program continues to read and print rectangles until the user inputs `0` for both `h` and `w`.

To optimize the program for running time and memory usage, we can eliminate the need for the `std::stringstream` and directly print the rectangle using `std::cout` in the nested for loops. This way, we can avoid the overhead of creating and manipulating the `std::stringstream` object.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

auto main() -> int {
  int h, w;
  while (std::cin >> h >> w && (h != 0 || w != 0)) {
    for (int y = 0; y < h; ++y) {
      for (int x = 0; x < w; ++x) {
        std::cout << '#';
      }
      std::cout << '\n';
    }
    std::cout << std::endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```

In this optimized program, we use a `while` loop instead of a `for` loop to read the input and check if both `h` and `w` are zero. This allows us to eliminate the `break` statement and simplify the code.

Inside the loop, we directly print the `#` characters using `std::cout`, without the need for a `std::stringstream`. We also print a newline character after each row of the rectangle.

Finally, we print an extra `std::endl` after each rectangle to ensure that the output is flushed and displayed immediately.
