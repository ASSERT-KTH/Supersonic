The given program reads two integers h and w from the user, and then prints a rectangle of '#' characters with height h and width w. It repeats this process until both h and w are zero.

To optimize this program, we can eliminate the use of the stringstream and directly print the '#' characters to the standard output.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

auto main() -> int {
  int h, w;
  while (std::cin >> h >> w && !(h == 0 && w == 0)) {
    for (int y = 0; y < h; ++y) {
      for (int x = 0; x < w; ++x) {
        std::cout << '#';
      }
      std::cout << '\n';
    }
    std::cout << std::endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Explanation of optimization steps:

1. Replaced the `for(;;)` loop with a `while` loop that reads `h` and `w` from the `std::cin` stream. This avoids an unnecessary conditional check inside the loop.

2. Removed the use of `std::stringstream` and directly printed the '#' characters to the standard output using `std::cout`. This eliminates the need to create and manipulate a stringstream object, improving both memory usage and running time.

3. Replaced `std::cout << ss.str() << std::endl;` with `std::cout << '\n';`. There is no need to explicitly flush the output buffer using `std::endl`. Instead, we can simply print a newline character '\n' to move to the next line. This reduces unnecessary flushing of the output buffer, improving running time.
