Step 1: Remove unnecessary header files
The `<algorithm>` header file is not being used in the program, so it can be removed to reduce unnecessary overhead.

Step 2: Optimize the input loop
Instead of using an infinite loop with a `break` statement, we can use a `while` loop with a condition to check if `h` and `w` are both zero. This way, we can eliminate the need for the `break` statement.

Step 3: Optimize the output loop
Instead of using a `std::stringstream` to accumulate the output, we can directly output the '#' characters and newline characters using `std::cout`. This eliminates the need for the `std::stringstream` and the `ss.str()` call.

Step 4: Minimize the number of `std::endl` calls
The `std::endl` manipulator flushes the output stream, which can be expensive in terms of performance. In this case, we can replace `std::endl` with a newline character `'\n'` to avoid unnecessary flushing.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

auto main() -> int {
  int h, w;
  while (std::cin >> h >> w && (h != 0 || w != 0)) {
    for (int y = 0; y < h; ++y) {
      for (int x = 0; x < w; ++x) {
        std::cout << '#';
      }
      std::cout << '\n';
    }
    std::cout << std::flush;
  }
  return 0;
}
```
