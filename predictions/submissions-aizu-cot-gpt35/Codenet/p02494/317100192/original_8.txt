Optimization steps:

1. Avoid unnecessary includes: The `<algorithm>` library is not used in the program, so it can be removed.

2. Avoid unnecessary headers: The `<sstream>` library is only used to create a string stream, which is not necessary for this program. We can remove the include.

3. Avoid using `std::endl`: The `std::endl` manipulator flushes the output stream, which can be an expensive operation. We can replace it with the newline character `'\n'` to improve performance.

4. Avoid using `std::stringstream`: The `std::stringstream` is used to create a string stream and then convert it to a string using `ss.str()`. This can be inefficient for large inputs. Instead, we can directly output the characters to `std::cout`.

5. Refactor the loop conditions: The loop conditions `h == 0 && w == 0` can be simplified to `!(h || w)` for readability.

Optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  int h, w;
  while (true) {
    std::cin >> h >> w;
    if (!(h || w)) {
      break;
    }
    for (int y = 0; y < h; ++y) {
      for (int x = 0; x < w; ++x) {
        std::cout << '#';
      }
      std::cout << '\n';
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```
