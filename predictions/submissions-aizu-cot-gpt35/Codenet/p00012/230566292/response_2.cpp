Step 1: Avoid unnecessary includes
- The program includes the `<algorithm>` header, but there are no algorithms being used. Remove this include statement.

Step 2: Avoid unnecessary using statements
- The program includes the `<cstdio>` and `<vector>` headers, but does not use any functions or classes from these headers. Remove the `using namespace std;` statement and the `<vector>` include statement.

Step 3: Avoid unnecessary namespace declaration and operator overloading
- The `std` namespace is being unnecessarily re-declared in the program. Remove the `namespace std` block and the `using namespace std` statement.
- The `<complex>` header is included, but the complex number `Point` type is not used in the program. Remove this include statement.
- The `<vector>` header is included, but the `Plane` type is not used in the program. Remove this include statement.

Step 4: Optimize the `ccwise` function
- The `ccwise` function calculates `cross_prod(b, c)` twice. Store the result in a variable and reuse it.
- The `ccwise` function calculates `dot_prod(b, c)` twice. Store the result in a variable and reuse it.
- The `ccwise` function calculates `norm(b)` twice. Store the result in a variable and reuse it.
- The `ccwise` function can be simplified by removing the unnecessary `else` statements.

Step 5: Optimize the `testcase_ends` function
- Use `scanf` to read all the inputs at once instead of individual `scanf` calls.
- Avoid redundant calculations by storing the result of `ccwise` in a variable instead of calling it multiple times.
- Use a single `printf` statement to print the output instead of multiple `printf` calls.
