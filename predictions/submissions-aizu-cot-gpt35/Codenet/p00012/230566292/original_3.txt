The given program reads multiple test cases from input and checks if a point P lies inside a triangle ABC. It uses the ccwise function to determine the orientation of three points. If the orientation is the same for all three vertices of the triangle, the point P lies inside the triangle.

To optimize the program, we can make the following changes:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The program includes unnecessary headers `<algorithm>`, `<cstdio>`, and `<vector>`. These headers are not used in the program and can be removed.

2. Remove unnecessary typedefs: The program defines `Point` as `complex<double>` and `Plane` as `vector<Point>`. These typedefs are not used in the program and can be removed.

3. Avoid unnecessary calculations: The `ccwise` function calculates the dot product and cross product multiple times. We can optimize it by calculating these values only once and storing them in variables.

4. Simplify the logic inside the main loop: The main loop uses a `while` loop and increments a `solved` variable. Instead, we can use a `for` loop with a counter variable.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <complex>
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

static const double EPS = 1e-12;

struct LineSeg {
  complex<double> a, b;
};

enum CCWiseState {
  ONLINE_FRONT = -2,
  CLOCKWISE,
  ON_SEGMENT,
  COUNTER_CLOCKWISE,
  ONLINE_BACK,
};

CCWiseState ccwise(complex<double> a, complex<double> b, complex<double> c) {
  complex<double> ba = b - a;
  complex<double> ca = c - a;
  double cross = (conj(ba) * ca).imag();
  double dot = (conj(ba) * ca).real();

  if (cross > EPS) {
    return COUNTER_CLOCKWISE;
  } else if (cross < -EPS) {
    return CLOCKWISE;
  } else if (dot < -EPS) {
    return ONLINE_BACK;
  } else if (norm(ba) < norm(ca)) {
    return ONLINE_FRONT;
  } else {
    return ON_SEGMENT;
  }
}

bool testcase_ends() {
  double x, y;
  if (cin >> x >> y) {
    complex<double> A(x, y);
    cin >> x >> y;
    complex<double> B(x, y);
    cin >> x >> y;
    complex<double> C(x, y);
    cin >> x >> y;
    complex<double> P(x, y);

    CCWiseState tmp = ccwise(A, P, B);
    if (tmp != ccwise(B, P, C) || tmp != ccwise(C, P, A)) {
      cout << "NO" << endl;
    } else {
      cout << "YES" << endl;
    }

    return false;
  }

  return true;
}

int main() {
  int solved = 0;
  for (; !testcase_ends(); ++solved)
    ;
  
  return !solved;
}
```

This optimized program simplifies the code, removes unnecessary calculations, and improves the overall efficiency.
