The given program reads input from the user and performs some calculations based on the input. Here are the steps to optimize the program:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The program includes unnecessary header files such as `<algorithm>`, `<cstdio>`, and `<vector>`. Since these header files are not used in the program, we can remove them.

2. Remove unnecessary constants: The program defines constants `EPS` and `INF`, but they are not used. We can remove these constants.

3. Remove unnecessary overloaded operator: The program overloads the `<` operator for the `Point` struct, but this operator is not used. We can remove the overloaded operator.

4. Remove unnecessary functions: The program defines two functions `cross_prod` and `dot_prod`, but these functions are not used. We can remove these functions.

5. Simplify the `ccwise` function: The `ccwise` function can be simplified by removing unnecessary calculations and conditions. We can calculate the cross product `cross_prod(b, c)` only once and store it in a variable. We can also simplify the conditions by combining the conditions for CLOCKWISE and COUNTER_CLOCKWISE states. Additionally, we can remove the conditions for ONLINE_FRONT and ONLINE_BACK states, as they are not used in the program.

6. Simplify the `testcase_ends` function: The `testcase_ends` function can be simplified by removing unnecessary variable declarations and conditions. We can directly return the result of the `printf` function calls instead of using an if statement.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <complex>

using namespace std;

using Point = complex<double>;

enum CCWiseState {
  CLOCKWISE,
  ON_SEGMENT,
  COUNTER_CLOCKWISE,
};

CCWiseState ccwise(Point a, Point b, Point c) {
  double crossProduct = imag(conj(b - a) * (c - a));
  if (crossProduct > 0) {
    return COUNTER_CLOCKWISE;
  } else if (crossProduct < 0) {
    return CLOCKWISE;
  } else {
    return ON_SEGMENT;
  }
}

bool testcase_ends() {
  double x, y;
  if (scanf("%lf %lf", &x, &y) == EOF)
    return true;
  Point A(x, y);
  scanf("%lf %lf", &x, &y);
  Point B(x, y);
  scanf("%lf %lf", &x, &y);
  Point C(x, y);
  scanf("%lf %lf", &x, &y);
  Point P(x, y);
  CCWiseState tmp = ccwise(A, P, B);
  if (tmp != ccwise(B, P, C) || tmp != ccwise(C, P, A)) {
    printf("NO\n");
    return false;
  }
  printf("YES\n");
  return false;
}

int main() {
  while (!testcase_ends())
    ;
  return 0;
}
```
