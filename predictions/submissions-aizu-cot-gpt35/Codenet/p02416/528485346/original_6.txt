The given program reads a series of numbers as strings from the user until the user enters "0". For each number, it calculates the sum of its digits and prints the sum.

To optimize this program, we can eliminate the unnecessary use of `strlen` function in the for loop, as it is called in each iteration. We can calculate the length of the string before entering the loop and store it in a variable. This way, we avoid the overhead of calling `strlen` repeatedly.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <cstdio>
#include <cstring>
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  char num[1001];
  while (1) {
    scanf("%s", num);
    if (num[0] == '0')
      break;
    int len = strlen(num);
    int sum = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {
      sum += num[i] - '0';
    }
    printf("%d\n", sum);
  }
  return 0;
}
```

In the optimized program, we calculate the length of the string `num` before entering the loop and store it in the variable `len`. Then, we use `len` as the condition in the for loop, eliminating the need to call `strlen` in each iteration.
