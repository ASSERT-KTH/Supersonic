The given program reads a series of numbers as strings, calculates the sum of their digits, and prints the sum. It continues this process until it encounters a number with a leading '0'.

To optimize the program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove the unnecessary inclusion of `<iostream>` header as it is not used in the program.

2. Declare the `num` array with a smaller size since the maximum length of the input number is 1000 characters.

3. Use a more efficient loop condition in the `for` loop, comparing the index `i` against the length of `num` only once instead of every iteration.

4. Avoid using `strlen` function in the loop condition as it has a linear time complexity. Instead, store the length of `num` in a variable before the loop and use that variable in the condition.

5. Use `puts` function instead of `printf` function to print the sum as it is a simpler and faster alternative when formatting is not required.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <cstdio>
#include <cstring>

int main() {
  char num[1000];
  while (1) {
    scanf("%s", num);
    if (num[0] == '0')
      break;
    int sum = 0;
    int length = strlen(num);
    for (int i = 0; i < length; i++) {
      sum += num[i] - '0';
    }
    puts(std::to_string(sum).c_str());
  }
  return 0;
}
```
