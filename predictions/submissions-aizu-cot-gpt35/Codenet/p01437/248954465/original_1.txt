Optimization:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The program includes `<bits/stdc++.h>` which is a non-standard header and includes a lot of unnecessary standard library headers. We should remove it and only include the necessary headers.

2. Avoid using `using namespace std`: It is generally considered a bad practice to use `using namespace std` as it brings all the names from the `std` namespace into the global namespace. We should avoid it and explicitly use the `std` namespace where necessary.

3. Avoid unnecessary typedef: The program typedefs `long long` as `int64`. Instead of using this typedef, we can directly use `long long` in the program.

4. Avoid unnecessary global variables: The program declares several global variables which are only used within the main function. We should move these variables into the main function to avoid global namespace pollution.

5. Use precalculated values for `vx` and `vy`: The program uses `vx` and `vy` arrays to represent the changes in x and y coordinates for each direction. These values can be precalculated and stored in the arrays to avoid calculating them repeatedly during the program execution.

6. Avoid unnecessary string operations: The program uses the `std::string` class to perform some operations like finding the position of a character. We can use character comparison instead of string operations to improve performance.

7. Avoid unnecessary recursion: The `dfs` function uses recursion to solve the problem. We can avoid recursion by using a loop instead, which can be more efficient in terms of memory usage.

8. Avoid unnecessary memory allocation: The program uses a 3D array `nxt` to store the next position for each direction. We can optimize memory usage by using a 2D array instead, as the third dimension is not necessary.

9. Avoid unnecessary cout calls: The `dfs` function prints the current position every time it reaches the base case. We can avoid printing the position multiple times by storing the position in a variable and printing it at the end of the function.

10. Avoid unnecessary calculation in the loop condition: The `dfs` function uses the loop condition `(step - 1) % loop` to calculate the next step. We can precalculate this value before the loop to avoid unnecessary calculations in each iteration.

Optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <cstring>

const std::string tmp = "NESW";
const int vy[] = {-1, 0, 1, 0};
const int vx[] = {0, 1, 0, -1};

void dfs(int x, int y, int v, long long step, std::vector<std::string>& C) {
  int H = C.size();
  int W = C[0].size();

  while (true) {
    int nx = x + vx[v];
    int ny = y + vy[v];
    int nv = (v + 1) % 4;

    if (step == 0) {
      std::cout << y + 1 << " " << x + 1 << " " << tmp[v] << std::endl;
      return;
    } else if (0 <= nx && nx < W && 0 <= ny && ny < H && C[ny][nx] != '#') {
      int loop = -1;
      if (nx < W && ny < H) {
        loop = nx - x + ny - y + 1;
      }

      if (loop != -1) {
        step = (step - 1) % loop;
      }
      
      x = nx;
      y = ny;
    } else {
      v = nv;
    }
  }
}

int main() {
  int H, W;
  long long L;

  while (std::cin >> H >> W >> L, H) {
    std::vector<std::string> C(H);

    for (int i = 0; i < H; i++) {
      std::cin >> C[i];
    }

    int sx = -1, sy = -1, sv = -1;

    for (int i = 0; i < H; i++) {
      for (int j = 0; j < W; j++) {
        char c = C[i][j];

        for (int k = 0; k < 4; k++) {
          if (c == tmp[k]) {
            sx = j;
            sy = i;
            sv = k;
            break;
          }
        }

        if (sx != -1 && sy != -1 && sv != -1) {
          break;
        }
      }

      if (sx != -1 && sy != -1 && sv != -1) {
        break;
      }
    }

    dfs(sx, sy, sv, L, C);
  }

  return 0;
