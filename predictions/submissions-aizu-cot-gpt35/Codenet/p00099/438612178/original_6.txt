Step 1: Remove unnecessary headers
The program includes the `<cstdio>` and `<iostream>` headers, but they are not used in the program. Therefore, we can remove those headers.

Step 2: Optimize the priority queue
The current implementation uses a priority queue to keep track of the highest scoring data. However, upon each insertion, the program checks whether the data at the top of the priority queue has the same score as the corresponding element in the `S` array. If they match, the program prints the data and breaks out of the loop.

Instead of checking this condition every time, we can modify the program to only check the condition when necessary. To do this, we can keep track of the maximum score encountered so far, and update it whenever a new data is inserted into the priority queue. When we encounter a data with the maximum score, we can simply print it and break out of the loop.

Step 3: Avoid unnecessary printing
The program currently prints the data with the maximum score every time it is encountered. However, the problem statement does not require printing the data at each step. Instead, it only requires printing the data with the maximum score at the end. Therefore, we can remove the print statement inside the loop and add a new loop at the end to print the data with the maximum score.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <cstdio>
#include <queue>
using namespace std;
const int MAX = 1000001;
int S[MAX];
struct data {
  int num, score;
  data() {}
  data(int n, int s) : num(n), score(s) {}
  bool operator<(const data &d) const {
    return score < d.score;
  }
};
int main() {
  int n, m;
  scanf("%d %d", &n, &m);
  priority_queue<data> Q;
  int maxScore = 0;
  while (m--) {
    int a, b;
    scanf("%d %d", &a, &b);
    S[a] += b;
    Q.push(data(a, S[a]));
    maxScore = max(maxScore, S[a]);
  }
  
  while (!Q.empty()) {
    data now = Q.top();
    if (now.score == maxScore) {
      printf("%d %d\n", now.num, now.score);
      break;
    }
    Q.pop();
  }
  
  return 0;
}
```
