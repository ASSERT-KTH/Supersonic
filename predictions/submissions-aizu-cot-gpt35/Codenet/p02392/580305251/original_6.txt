The given program checks if three numbers (a, b, and c) are in increasing order. If they are, it prints "Yes", otherwise it prints "No".

To optimize the program, we can remove the unnecessary line of code `0 <= a, b, c <= 100;` as it does not have any effect on the program's functionality.

Here is the optimized program:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
  int a, b, c;
  scanf("%d %d %d", &a, &b, &c);
  if (a < b && b < c) {
    printf("Yes\n");
  } else {
    printf("No\n");
  }
  return 0;
}
```
