The given program is a simple program that checks if three numbers are in increasing order. The optimization can be done by removing the unnecessary line `0 <= a, b, c <= 100;` and also by removing the unnecessary parentheses in the return statement.

The optimized program is as follows:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
  int a, b, c;
  scanf("%d %d %d", &a, &b, &c);
  if (a < b && b < c) {
    printf("Yes\n");
  } else {
    printf("No\n");
  }
  return 0;
}
```
