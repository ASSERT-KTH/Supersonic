Explanation of the optimization steps:

1. Remove the line `0 <= a, b, c <= 100;` as it is not a valid syntax in C/C++. If you want to enforce the range of `a`, `b`, and `c` to be between 0 and 100, you can add an if statement to check the range.

2. Instead of using `scanf` to read the values of `a`, `b`, and `c`, we can use `fgets` to read a line of input and then parse it using `sscanf`. This can help in handling invalid input and prevent buffer overflows.

3. Instead of using `printf` to print "Yes" or "No", we can use a ternary operator to directly print the result based on the condition.

Here is the optimized C program:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
  int a, b, c;
  char input[100];

  fgets(input, sizeof(input), stdin);
  sscanf(input, "%d %d %d", &a, &b, &c);

  printf("%s\n", (a < b && b < c) ? "Yes" : "No");

  return 0;
}
```
