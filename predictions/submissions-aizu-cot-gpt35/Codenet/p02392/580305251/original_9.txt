The given program is a simple program that takes three integers as input and checks if they are in increasing order. If they are, it prints "Yes", otherwise it prints "No".

To optimize this program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove the unnecessary line `0 <= a, b, c <= 100;` as it does not serve any purpose.

2. Instead of using `scanf` to read input, we can use command line arguments to pass the input values directly to the program. This can save some time on input parsing.

3. We can remove the unnecessary `return (0);` statement from the end of the `main` function as it is not required.

Here is the optimized version of the program:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
  int a, b, c;
  
  a = atoi(argv[1]);
  b = atoi(argv[2]);
  c = atoi(argv[3]);

  if (a < b && b < c) {
    printf("Yes\n");
  } else {
    printf("No\n");
  }
}
```
