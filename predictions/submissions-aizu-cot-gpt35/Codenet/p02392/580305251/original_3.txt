Explanation of the optimization steps:

1. Remove the unnecessary line `0 <= a, b, c <= 100;`. This line has no effect on the program's logic and can be safely removed.

2. Instead of using `scanf` to read three integers, we can use `fgets` to read a line of input and then parse the integers from the string. This can reduce the number of system calls and improve performance.

3. Use a single `printf` statement instead of two separate `printf` statements. This reduces the number of system calls and improves performance.

4. Use a ternary operator to simplify the if-else statement.

5. Add comments to improve code readability and maintainability.

Here is the optimized program:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main(void) {
  int a, b, c;
  
  // Read a line of input
  char input[100];
  fgets(input, sizeof(input), stdin);
  
  // Parse the integers from the input string
  sscanf(input, "%d %d %d", &a, &b, &c);
  
  // Check if a < b < c
  printf("%s\n", (a < b && b < c) ? "Yes" : "No");
  
  return 0;
}
```
