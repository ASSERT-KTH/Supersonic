Step 1: Remove unnecessary variables
- The variables `a`, `b`, and `c` are only used for input and comparison. We can remove them and directly use the input values in the comparison.

Step 2: Remove unnecessary `printf("\n")`
- Since the program only uses `printf("Yes")` or `printf("No")`, there is no need to print a newline character before returning.
