Explanation of the optimization steps:

1. Remove unnecessary variable declarations: The variables `a`, `b`, and `c` are only used once in the program, so there is no need to declare them separately. We can directly read the values from the input using `scanf`.

2. Remove unnecessary condition check: The condition `a < b && b < c` is already checking whether `b` is greater than `a` and `c` is greater than `b`. We can directly check if `c` is greater than `a` to determine if the condition is true.

3. Use a ternary operator: Instead of using an `if-else` statement to print "Yes" or "No", we can use a ternary operator to achieve the same result in a more concise way.

4. Remove unnecessary `printf("\n")`: The `printf("\n")` at the end of the program is not necessary as the program will automatically add a new line after execution.

Optimized program:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  int a, b, c;
  scanf("%d%d%d", &a, &b, &c);
  printf("%s", (c > a) ? "Yes" : "No");
  return 0;
}
```
