Explanation:

The given program reads three integers from the user and checks if they are in ascending order. If they are, it prints "Yes", otherwise it prints "No".

To optimize the program for running time and memory usage, we can make the following modification:

Instead of reading the three integers from the user, we can use command-line arguments to directly pass the values to the program. This eliminates the need for the scanf function and reduces the program's running time. Additionally, we can remove the unnecessary newline character print statement at the end.

Here is the optimized program:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
  int a = atoi(argv[1]);
  int b = atoi(argv[2]);
  int c = atoi(argv[3]);

  if (a < b && b < c) {
    printf("Yes");
  } else {
    printf("No");
  }

  return 0;
}
```
