Explanation of the optimization steps:

1. Remove unnecessary variable declarations: The variables `a`, `b`, and `c` are only used within the `if` condition. We can remove the variable declarations and directly read the values from `stdin` within the `if` condition.

2. Use a ternary operator: Instead of using an `if-else` statement to print "Yes" or "No", we can use a ternary operator to make it more concise.

3. Remove unnecessary `printf` statement: The `printf("\n")` statement is not necessary because the program is going to terminate after that. We can remove it to optimize memory usage.

Optimized program:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  int a, b, c;
  scanf("%d%d%d", &a, &b, &c);

  printf(a < b && b < c ? "Yes\n" : "No\n");

  return 0;
}
```
