Step 1: Eliminate unnecessary variables
- The variables `a`, `b`, and `c` are only used once each, so we can eliminate them and directly store the values in the `scanf` function.

Step 2: Remove unnecessary `printf` statement
- The `printf("\n")` statement is unnecessary and can be removed.

Step 3: Optimize the `printf` statement
- Instead of using two separate `printf` statements, we can use a single `printf` statement with a conditional operator to print "Yes" or "No" based on the condition.

Here's the optimized code:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  int a, b, c;
  scanf("%d%d%d", &a, &b, &c);
  
  printf("%s\n", (a < b && b < c) ? "Yes" : "No");
  
  return 0;
}
```
