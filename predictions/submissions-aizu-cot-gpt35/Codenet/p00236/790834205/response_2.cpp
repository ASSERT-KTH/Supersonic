Step 1: Avoid unnecessary includes
There are some unnecessary includes in the given program. We can remove them to improve compilation time and reduce the memory usage.

The unnecessary includes are:
- `#include <algorithm>`: This header is not used in the program.
- `#include <set>`: This header is not used in the program.
- `#include <bitset>`: This header is not used in the program.

Step 2: Avoid unnecessary variables and data structures
There are some unnecessary variables and data structures in the given program. We can remove them to reduce memory usage.

The unnecessary variables and data structures are:
- `bitset<N> visited`: This variable is not used in the `make_graph()` function. We can remove it from the global scope and pass it as a parameter to the `reachability()` function.
- `set<unsigned long long> memo`: This data structure is not used in the `make_graph()` function. We can remove it from the global scope and pass it as a parameter to the `dfs()` function.

Step 3: Optimize the `make_graph()` function
The `make_graph()` function can be optimized by removing the unnecessary checks and reducing the number of iterations.

The optimizations are:
- Instead of initializing `vertex` and `edge` with a size of `h * w`, we can initialize them with a size of `size`. This will reduce the memory usage.
- Instead of checking if `field[y][x]` is zero in the inner loop, we can check if `vertex[y][x]` is not equal to `NIL`. This will reduce the number of iterations.
- Instead of using a nested loop to iterate over `NEXT`, we can use a single loop and calculate `ny` and `nx` directly. This will reduce the number of iterations.

Step 4: Optimize the `reachability()` function
The `reachability()` function can be optimized by removing the unnecessary checks and reducing the number of iterations.

The optimizations are:
- Instead of checking if `visited[to]` is false in the inner loop, we can check if `visited[to]` is true. This will reduce the number of iterations.

Step 5: Optimize the `cut_vertex()` function
The `cut_vertex()` function can be optimized by removing the unnecessary checks and reducing the number of iterations.

The optimizations are:
- Instead of using a separate `dup` variable, we can directly modify the `visited` variable. This will reduce the memory usage.
- Instead of checking if `dup.count()` is not equal to `size` in the inner loop, we can check if `dup.count()` is equal to `size`. This will reduce the number of iterations.

Step 6: Optimize the `dfs()` function
The `dfs()` function can be optimized by removing the unnecessary checks and reducing the number of iterations.

The optimizations are:
- Instead of using a separate `m` variable, we can calculate the hash value directly. This will reduce the memory usage.
- Instead of checking if `visited[u]` is false in the inner loop, we can check if `visited[u]` is true. This will reduce the number of iterations.
- Instead of using a separate `degree` variable, we can use a counter variable to keep track of the degree. This will reduce the memory usage and the number of iterations.
- Instead of checking if `degree` is less than 2 in the inner loop, we can check if `degree` is equal to 2. This will reduce the number of iterations.
