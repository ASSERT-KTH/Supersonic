The given program is a topological sorting algorithm implemented using a vector of vectors to represent an adjacency list. The algorithm calculates the in-degree of each vertex and uses a stack to keep track of vertices with in-degree 0. It then iteratively removes vertices from the stack and updates the in-degree of their neighbors until all vertices have been processed.

Here are the steps to optimize the program:

1. Remove the unnecessary `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` line. It includes a large number of standard library headers, which can slow down compilation and increase memory usage.

2. Change the `typedef vector<vector<Edge>> Adj_list;` statement to `using Adj_list = vector<vector<int>>;`. This simplifies the definition of the adjacency list and removes the need for the `Edge` struct.

3. Instead of using a stack to store vertices with in-degree 0, use a `queue` data structure. This will allow for a more efficient removal of vertices from the front of the queue.

4. Remove the assert statements that check the in-degree of each vertex after the topological sorting process. These assertions are not necessary for the correctness of the algorithm and can slow down the program.

5. Instead of returning the `topological_order` vector, modify the `topological_sort` function to accept a reference to an empty vector and populate it with the topological order. This will eliminate the need for an additional vector assignment in the `main` function.

Here is the optimized C++ program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
using namespace std;

using Adj_list = vector<vector<int>>;

void topological_sort(const Adj_list& G, vector<int>& topological_order) {
  const int V = G.size();
  vector<int> inorder(V, 0);
  for (int i = 0; i < V; i++)
    for (int tgt : G[i])
      inorder[tgt]++;
  queue<int> S;
  for (int i = 0; i < V; i++)
    if (inorder[i] == 0)
      S.push(i);
  while (!S.empty()) {
    int v = S.front();
    S.pop();
    topological_order.push_back(v);
    for (int tgt : G[v]) {
      inorder[tgt]--;
      if (inorder[tgt] == 0)
        S.push(tgt);
    }
  }
}

int main() {
  int V, E;
  cin >> V >> E;
  Adj_list G(V);
  for (int i = 0; i < E; i++) {
    int s, t;
    cin >> s >> t;
    G[s].push_back(t);
  }
  vector<int> ans;
  topological_sort(G, ans);
  for (int i = 0; i < V; i++)
    cout << ans[i] << endl;
}
```

This optimized program reduces memory usage by eliminating the `Edge` struct and using a queue instead of a stack. It also improves the running time by removing unnecessary assertions and avoiding the use of an additional vector assignment.
