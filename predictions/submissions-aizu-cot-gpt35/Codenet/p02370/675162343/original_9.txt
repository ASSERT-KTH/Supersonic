The given program is a topological sorting algorithm that uses a depth-first search approach. It first calculates the in-degree of each vertex and then performs a depth-first search to find the topological order.

To optimize the program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary header inclusion: The `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` includes a large number of standard library headers, which can slow down compilation time. We can remove this line and include only the necessary headers.

2. Pass the `Adj_list` by reference in the `topological_sort` function: Currently, the `Adj_list` is passed by value, which creates a copy of the entire graph. This can be memory-intensive, especially for large graphs. By passing it by reference, we can avoid unnecessary copying.

3. Use a `stack` instead of a `vector` for `S`: In the current implementation, the `S` vector is used as a stack to store the vertices with in-degree 0. However, the `push_back` and `pop_back` operations on a vector can be slightly slower compared to a stack. We can use a `stack` container instead, which is specifically designed for LIFO (last-in, first-out) operations.

4. Use `emplace_back` instead of `push_back` for adding edges to `G`: The `push_back` function copies the `Edge` object, which can be unnecessary. We can use `emplace_back` to construct the `Edge` object directly in the vector without copying.

5. Use a range-based for loop instead of an indexed loop for printing the result: The current loop for printing the topological order uses an indexed loop. We can use a range-based for loop to simplify the code and improve readability.

Here is the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <stack>
#include <cassert>

struct Edge {
  int tgt_;
  Edge(int t) { tgt_ = t; }
};

typedef std::vector<std::vector<Edge>> Adj_list;

std::vector<int> topological_sort(Adj_list& G) {
  const int V = G.size();
  std::vector<int> S;
  std::vector<int> inorder(V, 0);
  for (auto& edges : G) {
    for (Edge& e : edges) {
      inorder[e.tgt_]++;
    }
  }
  for (int i = 0; i < V; i++) {
    if (inorder[i] == 0) {
      S.emplace_back(i);
    }
  }
  assert(S.size() > 0);
  std::vector<int> topological_order;
  while (!S.empty()) {
    int v = S.top();
    S.pop();
    topological_order.emplace_back(v);
    for (int i = G[v].size() - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
      Edge e = G[v][i];
      inorder[e.tgt_]--;
      if (inorder[e.tgt_] == 0) {
        S.emplace(e.tgt_);
      }
    }
  }
  for (int i = 0; i < V; i++) {
    assert(inorder[i] == 0);
  }
  return topological_order;
}

int main() {
  int V, E;
  std::cin >> V >> E;
  Adj_list G(V);
  for (int i = 0; i < E; i++) {
    int s, t;
    std::cin >> s >> t;
    G[s].emplace_back(t);
  }
  std::vector<int> ans = topological_sort(G);
  for (int v : ans) {
    std::cout << v << std::endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```

These optimizations should help improve the running time and reduce memory usage of the program.
