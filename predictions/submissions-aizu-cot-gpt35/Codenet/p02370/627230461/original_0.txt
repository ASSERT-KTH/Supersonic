The given program is an implementation of the topological sort algorithm using a vector of vectors to represent a directed graph. It takes the number of vertices (V) and edges (E) as input, reads the edges from the standard input, performs the topological sort, and prints the sorted vertices.

To optimize the program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Instead of using a fixed size vector of vectors for the edges, we can use a dynamically resizable vector of vectors. This will reduce the memory usage when the number of vertices is smaller than 10001.

2. We can replace the second loop that finds the vertices with no incoming edges with a single pass loop that counts the incoming edges for each vertex. This will reduce the time complexity of this step from O(V+E) to O(E).

3. We can use a queue data structure instead of a vector to store the vertices with no incoming edges. This will improve the efficiency of adding and removing elements from the data structure.

4. Instead of using a separate loop to print the sorted vertices, we can directly print them as we pop them from the queue. This will avoid the need to store the sorted vertices in a separate vector.

Here's the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int V, E;
  cin >> V >> E;
  
  vector<vector<int>> edge(V);
  vector<int> state(V, 0);
  
  for (int i = 0; i < E; i++) {
    int s, t;
    cin >> s >> t;
    edge[s].push_back(t);
    state[t]++;
  }
  
  queue<int> q;
  for (int i = 0; i < V; i++) {
    if (state[i] == 0)
      q.push(i);
  }
  
  while (!q.empty()) {
    int u = q.front();
    q.pop();
    
    cout << u << endl;
    
    for (int v : edge[u]) {
      state[v]--;
      if (state[v] == 0)
        q.push(v);
    }
  }
  
  return 0;
}
```

Explanation of the optimization steps:

1. Replaced the fixed size vector of vectors `edge(10001)` with a dynamically resizable vector `edge(V)`.
2. Replaced the second loop that finds the vertices with no incoming edges with a single pass loop that counts the incoming edges for each vertex using the `state` vector.
3. Changed the data structure for storing the vertices with no incoming edges from a vector `ans` to a queue `q`.
4. Removed the third loop that prints the sorted vertices and directly print the vertices as they are popped from the queue.
