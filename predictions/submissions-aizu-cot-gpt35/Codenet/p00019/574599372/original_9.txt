Analysis:

The given program calculates the factorial of a given number `n`. 

Optimizations:
1. Remove unnecessary header files: The program includes `<cstdio>` but it is not used. We can remove it to improve compilation time and reduce memory usage.
2. Remove `using namespace std;`: This line is not required as we can use the `std::` prefix for standard library functions and objects.
3. Avoid using `long long` for `a`: Since the factorial of `n` can be very large, using `long long` may not be necessary. We can use `unsigned long long` instead to save memory.
4. Use a more efficient algorithm to calculate the factorial: The current implementation uses a simple loop to calculate the factorial. However, we can optimize it by using a divide-and-conquer approach known as "binary exponentiation". This approach reduces the number of multiplications required to calculate the factorial.

Optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

unsigned long long factorial(int n) {
  if (n == 0 || n == 1)
    return 1;
  
  unsigned long long result = factorial(n / 2);
  result *= result;
  
  if (n % 2 == 1)
    result *= n;
  
  return result;
}

int main() {
  int n;
  std::cin >> n;
  std::cout << factorial(n) << std::endl;
  return 0;
}
```

Explanation:
1. We define a function `factorial` that takes an integer `n` as input and returns the factorial of `n`.
2. Inside the `factorial` function, we check if `n` is either 0 or 1. If so, we return 1 as the factorial of both 0 and 1 is 1.
3. Otherwise, we calculate the factorial recursively using the binary exponentiation approach.
4. In the binary exponentiation approach, we calculate `factorial(n / 2)` and store it in the `result` variable. Then, we multiply `result` with itself to get the factorial of `n / 2` squared.
5. If `n` is odd (i.e., `n % 2 == 1`), we multiply `result` with `n` to account for the missing factor.
6. Finally, we return the calculated `result` as the factorial of `n`.
7. In the `main` function, we read the input value of `n` and output the factorial by calling the `factorial` function.
