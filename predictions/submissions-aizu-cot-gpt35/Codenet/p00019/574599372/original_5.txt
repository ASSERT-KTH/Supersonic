This program calculates the factorial of a given number `n`. 

To optimize the program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary `#include` statements: The program only uses `iostream` and `cstdio` headers, so we can remove `cstdio` since it is not used.

2. Remove `using namespace std;`: This statement is generally considered bad practice as it pollutes the global namespace. Instead, we can use the `std::` prefix for the relevant functions and types.

3. Change `main()` to `int main()`: The `main` function should have a return type of `int` according to the C++ standard.

4. Use a more efficient algorithm: Currently, the program calculates the factorial using a simple iterative loop. We can optimize this by using a more efficient algorithm, such as the recursive factorial function.

Taking these optimizations into account, here's the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

long long factorial(int n) {
  if (n == 0 || n == 1) {
    return 1;
  }
  return n * factorial(n - 1);
}

int main() {
  int n;
  std::cin >> n;
  std::cout << factorial(n) << std::endl;
  return 0;
}
```
