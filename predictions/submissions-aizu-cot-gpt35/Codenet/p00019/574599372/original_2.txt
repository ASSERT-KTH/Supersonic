The given program calculates the factorial of a number `n`. The optimization can be done by removing the unnecessary `using namespace std` statement and using a more efficient algorithm to calculate the factorial.

Explanation of the optimization steps:
1. Remove the `using namespace std` statement: This statement imports all names from the `std` namespace into the global namespace, which can lead to naming conflicts and is generally considered bad practice. Instead, we can use the `std::` prefix to indicate the usage of names from the `std` namespace.

2. Use a more efficient algorithm to calculate the factorial: The current implementation calculates the factorial by iteratively multiplying the numbers from 2 to `n`. This approach has a time complexity of O(n). We can optimize this by using a recursive algorithm that has a time complexity of O(log n). This algorithm uses the property `n! = n * (n-1)!`. 

Optimized code:
```cpp
#include <iostream>

long long factorial(int n) {
  if (n == 0) {
    return 1;
  } else {
    return n * factorial(n - 1);
  }
}

int main() {
  int n;
  std::cin >> n;
  std::cout << factorial(n) << std::endl;
  return 0;
}
```
