The given program calculates the factorial of a number `n` using a simple for loop. 

To optimize the program for running time, we can use a more efficient algorithm to calculate the factorial. Currently, the program uses a loop to multiply each number from 2 to `n` with the previous factorial. This approach has a time complexity of O(n).

However, we can optimize this by using a recursive approach. The factorial of `n` can be calculated by multiplying `n` with the factorial of `n-1`. By doing this recursively, we can reduce the number of multiplications required. This approach has a time complexity of O(log n).

To optimize the program for memory usage, we can use a smaller data type for the variable `a`. Currently, `a` is of type `long long`, which uses 8 bytes of memory. Since the factorial of `n` can grow very large, we can use a data type that has a smaller memory footprint while still being able to hold the result. We can use `unsigned long long` instead, which uses 8 bytes of memory but can represent larger positive numbers.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

unsigned long long factorial(int n) {
  if (n == 0 || n == 1)
    return 1;
  else
    return n * factorial(n - 1);
}

int main() {
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  unsigned long long result = factorial(n);
  cout << result << endl;
  return 0;
}
```

In the optimized program, we define a function `factorial` that calculates the factorial of a number recursively. The function checks if the input number `n` is either 0 or 1, in which case it returns 1. Otherwise, it multiplies `n` with the factorial of `n-1` and returns the result.

In the `main` function, we read the input number `n` from the user and call the `factorial` function to calculate the factorial. The result is then printed using `cout`.
