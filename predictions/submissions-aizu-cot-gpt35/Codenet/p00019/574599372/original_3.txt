The given program calculates the factorial of a given number using a for loop. 

To optimize the program, we can make two modifications:

1. Remove the unnecessary inclusion of the `<cstdio>` header file as it is not being used in the program.
2. Instead of using a `long long` data type for the variable `a`, we can use an `unsigned long long` data type to save memory since the factorial of a number will always be a positive integer.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  unsigned long long a = 1;
  int n;
  cin >> n;

  for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
    a *= i;
  }

  cout << a << endl;
  return 0;
}
```
