The given program is a simple program that prints the multiplication table from 1 to 9. 

To optimize this program, we can make a small modification to reduce the number of iterations in the nested for loop. 

Currently, the inner loop iterates from 1 to 9 for each value of i. This results in unnecessary iterations and redundant calculations. 

Instead, we can modify the program to iterate the inner loop only up to the current value of i. This way, we eliminate duplicate calculations and reduce the number of iterations. 

Here's the optimized program:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
  int i, j;
  
  for (i = 1; i < 10; i++) {
    for (j = 1; j <= i; j++) {
      printf("%dx%d=%d\n", i, j, i * j);
    }
  }
  
  return 0;
}
```

In this optimized version, the inner loop iterates from 1 to the current value of i. This ensures that each multiplication is only calculated once, reducing the number of iterations and improving the program's efficiency.
