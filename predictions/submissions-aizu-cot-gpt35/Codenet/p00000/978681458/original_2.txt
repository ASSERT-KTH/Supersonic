The given program is a simple nested loop that prints the multiplication table from 1 to 9. To optimize this program, we can make a few modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary variable declaration: The variables `i` and `j` can be declared directly inside the for loop initialization since they are not used outside the loop.

2. Reduce the number of iterations: Since we only need to print the multiplication table up to 9, we can modify the loop conditions to `i <= 9` and `j <= 9` to include the number 9.

3. Remove unnecessary parentheses: The return statement does not require parentheses.

Here is the optimized version of the program:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main(void) {
  for (int i = 1; i <= 9; i++) {
    for (int j = 1; j <= 9; j++) {
      printf("%dx%d=%d\n", i, j, i * j);
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```
