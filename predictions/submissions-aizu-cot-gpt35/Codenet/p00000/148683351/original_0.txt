The given program generates and prints the multiplication table from 1 to 9. To optimize the program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove the `using namespace std;` line and explicitly use the `std` namespace where necessary. This helps avoid namespace pollution.

2. Use `'\n'` instead of `endl` to improve performance. The `endl` manipulator flushes the output buffer, which can be unnecessary and slow in this case.

3. Use pre-increment (`++i` and `++j`) instead of post-increment (`i++` and `j++`) in the loop conditions. Pre-increment is generally more efficient because it avoids creating a temporary copy of the variable.

4. Use `printf` instead of `cout` for better performance. `printf` is generally faster than `cout` for formatted output.

Here is the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  for (int i = 1; i <= 9; ++i) {
    for (int j = 1; j <= 9; ++j) {
      std::printf("%dx%d=%d\n", i, j, i * j);
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```
