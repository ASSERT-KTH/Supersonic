The given program prints the multiplication table from 1 to 9. 

To optimize the program, we can reduce the number of iterations by half since the multiplication table is symmetric. For example, instead of calculating 1x2 and 2x1 separately, we can calculate them together.

Here is the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  for (int i = 1; i <= 9; i++) {
    for (int j = i; j <= 9; j++) {
      cout << i << "x" << j << "=" << i * j << endl;
      if (i != j) {
        cout << j << "x" << i << "=" << i * j << endl;
      }
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```

In the optimized program, the inner loop starts from `i` instead of 1, and we print the multiplication results for both `i` and `j`. This way, we only calculate and print each multiplication once, reducing the number of iterations and improving the program's efficiency.
