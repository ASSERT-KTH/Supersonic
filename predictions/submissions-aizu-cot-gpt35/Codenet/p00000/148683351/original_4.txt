Explanation:
The original program creates a nested loop to calculate and print the multiplication table from 1 to 9. The program iterates through all possible combinations of values from 1 to 9 for both `i` and `j`. This results in 81 iterations of the inner loop.

To optimize the program, we can eliminate unnecessary iterations by making a small modification to the loop conditions.

Optimization Steps:
1. Notice that the multiplication table is symmetric along the diagonal. For example, `2x3` is the same as `3x2`. Therefore, we only need to calculate and print the values for either `i <= j` or `i >= j`.
2. Modify the loop condition for the inner loop to `j <= i`. This ensures that we only calculate and print the values for `i >= j`, which eliminates half of the unnecessary iterations.

Optimized Program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  for (int i = 1; i <= 9; i++) {
    for (int j = 1; j <= i; j++) {
      cout << i << "x" << j << "=" << i * j << endl;
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```

In the optimized program, we only iterate through the values of `j` that are less than or equal to `i`, effectively reducing the total number of iterations to 45. This optimization improves both the running time and memory usage of the program.
