The given program generates the multiplication table from 1x1 to 9x9. To optimize this program for running time and memory usage, we can make the following modifications:

1. Instead of using `std::endl` to insert a new line after each multiplication, we can use `'\n'` which is faster because it does not flush the output stream.
2. We can avoid repeated calculations by storing the result of `i * j` in a variable before printing it.
3. We can remove the `using namespace std;` statement and explicitly prefix the `cout` object with `std::` to avoid namespace pollution.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  for (int i = 1; i <= 9; i++) {
    for (int j = 1; j <= 9; j++) {
      int result = i * j;
      std::cout << i << "x" << j << "=" << result << '\n';
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```
