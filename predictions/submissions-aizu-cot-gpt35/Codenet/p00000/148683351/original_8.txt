The given program prints the multiplication table from 1 to 9 using nested for loops. To optimize this program, we can make a small modification to reduce the number of iterations.

Currently, the program uses two nested for loops to iterate through all combinations of `i` and `j` from 1 to 9. However, we can observe that the multiplication table is symmetric, meaning the result of `i * j` is the same as `j * i`. Therefore, we can optimize the program by only printing one combination of `i` and `j` for each unique pair, reducing the number of iterations by half.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  for (int i = 1; i <= 9; i++) {
    for (int j = i; j <= 9; j++) {
      cout << i << "x" << j << "=" << i * j << endl;
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```

In the optimized program, we modified the inner loop to start from `i` instead of 1. This ensures that we only print one combination of `i` and `j` for each unique pair. By doing so, we reduce the number of iterations from 81 to 45, resulting in improved running time and memory usage.
