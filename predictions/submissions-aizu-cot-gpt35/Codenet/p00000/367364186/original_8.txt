The given program performs a nested loop to print the multiplication table from 1 to 9. To optimize this program, we can eliminate unnecessary iterations by starting the loops from 2 instead of 1.

Explanation of the optimization steps:
1. The multiplication table starts from 2, so we can start the outer loop from 2 instead of 1.
2. The inner loop also starts from 2 instead of 1 since multiplying any number by 1 will not change its value.
3. By starting the loops from 2, we eliminate unnecessary iterations and reduce the running time and memory usage.

Here's the optimized program:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  for (int i = 2; i < 10; i++) {
    for (int j = 2; j < 10; j++) {
      printf("%dx%d=%d\n", i, j, i * j);
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```
