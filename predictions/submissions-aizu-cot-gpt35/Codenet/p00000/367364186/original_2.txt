The given program computes and prints the multiplication table for numbers 1 to 9. Here are the optimization steps we can take to improve the program's running time and memory usage:

1. Remove the unnecessary variable initialization: The variables `i` and `j` are initialized to 1 in the for loops. Since they are immediately incremented in the loop declaration, this initialization is unnecessary.

2. Use a single loop instead of nested loops: Instead of using nested loops, we can use a single loop with a counter variable that goes from 1 to 9 * 9 (81 in total). We can then calculate `i` and `j` from this counter variable and compute the multiplication.

3. Use a single printf statement for the entire table: Instead of calling `printf` for each multiplication, we can build a string that contains all the multiplications and then print the string once.

Here's the optimized program:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  char table[1000]; // A buffer to hold the multiplication table
  int index = 0;

  for (int counter = 1; counter <= 81; counter++) {
    int i = (counter - 1) / 9 + 1;
    int j = (counter - 1) % 9 + 1;

    index += sprintf(table + index, "%dx%d=%d\n", i, j, i * j);
  }

  printf("%s", table);

  return 0;
}
```

In this optimized version, we use a buffer `table` to hold the multiplication table as a string. The counter variable goes from 1 to 81, and we calculate `i` and `j` based on the counter value. The `sprintf` function is used to append each multiplication to the `table` buffer, and the `index` variable is used to keep track of the current position in the buffer.

Finally, we print the entire table using a single `printf` statement, passing the `table` buffer as the format string.

These optimizations reduce the number of function calls and eliminate the need for nested loops, resulting in improved running time and memory usage.
