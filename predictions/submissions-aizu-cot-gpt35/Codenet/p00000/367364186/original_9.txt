The given program is a simple nested loop that prints the multiplication table from 1 to 9. To optimize this program, we can make a small modification to reduce the number of iterations in the outer loop.

Currently, the outer loop iterates from 1 to 9, and for each iteration, the inner loop iterates from 1 to 9. This results in a total of 81 iterations.

To optimize the program, we can modify the outer loop to iterate from 1 to 9, but the inner loop will iterate from 1 to the current value of the outer loop variable. This way, we can reduce the number of iterations in the inner loop for each iteration of the outer loop.

Let's implement this optimization and generate the optimized program:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  for (int i = 1; i < 10; i++) {
    for (int j = 1; j <= i; j++) {
      printf("%dx%d=%d\n", i, j, i * j);
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```

In the optimized program, the inner loop iterates from 1 to the current value of `i`. This reduces the total number of iterations from 81 to 45, resulting in improved performance in terms of both running time and memory usage.
