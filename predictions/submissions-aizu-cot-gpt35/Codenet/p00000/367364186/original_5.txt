Explanation of the optimization steps:

1. The original program has nested loops that iterate from 1 to 9. This means that the program will execute a total of 81 times (9 * 9). We can optimize this by reducing the number of iterations.

2. We can observe that multiplication is commutative, i.e., i * j is equal to j * i. Therefore, we can avoid unnecessary iterations by starting the inner loop from the current value of the outer loop.

3. Additionally, we can modify the program to only print the multiplication results for unique pairs of (i, j) where i <= j. This will further reduce the number of iterations and eliminate duplicate output.

Here is the optimized program:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  for (int i = 1; i < 10; i++) {
    for (int j = i; j < 10; j++) {
      printf("%dx%d=%d\n", i, j, i * j);
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```

By making these modifications, we reduce the total number of iterations from 81 to 45, resulting in improved running time and memory usage.
