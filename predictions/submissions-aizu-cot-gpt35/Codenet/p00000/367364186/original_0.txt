The given program is a simple nested loop that prints the multiplication tables from 1 to 9. To optimize this program, we can make a small modification to reduce unnecessary iterations.

The optimization step is as follows:
1. Instead of running the nested loop from 1 to 9, we can reduce the iterations by running the outer loop from 1 to 9 and the inner loop from 1 to the current value of the outer loop. This way, we avoid unnecessary multiplications and print statements.

Here is the optimized program:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  for (int i = 1; i < 10; i++) {
    for (int j = 1; j <= i; j++) {
      printf("%dx%d=%d\n", i, j, i * j);
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```

By making this small modification, we reduced the number of iterations and avoided unnecessary calculations. This optimization enhances the running time and memory usage of the program.
