Step 1: Remove unnecessary variables and assignments

In the original program, the variable `a` is used as a flag to determine if the sum of elements in `S` is non-negative. However, it is unnecessary to assign `a` with 1 in each iteration of the while loop. We can simply initialize `a` with 1 before the while loop.

Step 2: Optimize the loop for reading input values

In the original program, the nested loop for reading the input values of `B` is not efficient. We can optimize this by using a single loop and reading the values directly into `S[j]` instead of using an intermediate variable `B`.

Step 3: Optimize the check for negative values in `S`

In the original program, the check for negative values in `S` is done for each iteration of the inner loop. We can optimize this by moving the check outside the loop and breaking out of the loop if a negative value is encountered.

Step 4: Delete dynamically allocated memory

In the original program, memory is dynamically allocated for `S` using the `new` operator. However, there is no corresponding `delete` statement to deallocate the memory. We need to add a `delete[] S` statement before the end of each iteration of the while loop to free the memory.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int N, K, i, j, *S, a;
  while (cin >> N >> K, N || K) {
    S = new int[K];
    for (i = K; i--;)
      cin >> S[i];
    a = 1;
    for (i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
      for (j = 0; j < K; ++j) {
        cin >> S[j];
        S[j] -= S[j];
        if (S[j] < 0) {
          a = 0;
          break;
        }
      }
    }
    cout << (a ? "Yes" : "No") << endl;
    delete[] S;
  }
}
```
