The given program is a solution to a problem where we need to check if a given combination of numbers can be obtained by subtracting some numbers from a given set of numbers.

To optimize the program, we can make the following changes:

1. Remove unnecessary variables: The variable `a` is used to keep track of the result. Instead of using `a`, we can directly use a boolean variable `result` to store the result.

2. Use `vector` instead of dynamic array: Instead of using a dynamic array `S`, we can use a `vector` to store the numbers. This will simplify the memory management and provide better memory usage. 

3. Avoid unnecessary comparisons: In the nested loop, we are checking if `S[j]` is less than 0 and updating `a` accordingly. Instead, we can use a `break` statement to exit the loop immediately when `S[j]` becomes negative.

4. Avoid unnecessary assignments: In the original program, `a` is assigned the value 1 in every iteration of the while loop. We can remove this assignment as it is not necessary.

5. Avoid unnecessary namespace: Instead of using `using namespace std`, we can qualify the standard library functions with `std::` prefix.

Here's the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

int main() {
  int N, K;
  while (std::cin >> N >> K, N || K) {
    std::vector<int> S(K);
    for (int i = 0; i < K; ++i)
      std::cin >> S[i];
      
    bool result = true;
    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
      for (int j = 0; j < K; ++j) {
        int B;
        std::cin >> B;
        S[j] -= B;
        if (S[j] < 0) {
          result = false;
          break;
        }
      }
    }
    
    std::cout << (result ? "Yes" : "No") << std::endl;
  }
}
```

These optimizations should improve the running time and memory usage of the program.
