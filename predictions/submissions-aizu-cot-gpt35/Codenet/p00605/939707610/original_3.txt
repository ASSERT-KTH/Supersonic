The given program has a nested loop that iterates N*K times. This can be quite inefficient if both N and K are large.

To optimize the program, we can modify the nested loop to break out early if a negative value is encountered in the S array. This way, we can avoid unnecessary iterations and improve the overall performance.

Here's the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int N, K, i, j, *S, B, a;
  while (a = 1, cin >> N >> K, N || K) {
    S = new int[K];
    for (i = K; i--;)
      cin >> S[i];

    for (i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
      for (j = K; j--;) {
        cin >> B;
        S[j] -= B;
        if (S[j] < 0) {
          a = 0;
          break;  // Break out of the inner loop if negative value encountered
        }
      }
      if (!a) {
        // Break out of the outer loop if negative value encountered
        break;
      }
    }

    cout << (a ? "Yes" : "No") << endl;

    delete[] S; // Free the dynamically allocated memory
  }
}
```

In the optimized program, we break out of the inner loop as soon as a negative value is encountered in the S array. We also break out of the outer loop if a negative value is encountered. This way, we avoid unnecessary iterations and improve the efficiency of the program.
