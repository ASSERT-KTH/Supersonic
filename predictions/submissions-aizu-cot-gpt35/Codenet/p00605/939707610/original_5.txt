To optimize the given C/C++ program, we can improve the memory usage by using a fixed-size array instead of dynamically allocating memory for the array `S`. This will avoid the overhead of memory allocation and deallocation in every iteration of the while loop.

Additionally, we can optimize the time complexity of the program by breaking out of the inner loop as soon as we find a negative value in `S[j]`. There is no need to check the remaining elements in the inner loop since the condition `S[j] < 0` already indicates that the answer will be "No".

Here is the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

const int MAX_K = 1000; // Maximum value of K

int main() {
  int N, K, i, j, S[MAX_K], B, a;
  while (a = 1, cin >> N >> K, N || K) {
    for (i = K; i--;)
      cin >> S[i];
    for (i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
      for (j = 0; j < K; ++j) {
        cin >> B;
        S[j] -= B;
        if (S[j] < 0) {
          a = 0;
          break;
        }
      }
    }
    cout << (a ? "Yes" : "No") << endl;
  }
}
```

Explanation of the optimization steps:
1. We removed the dynamic memory allocation for the array `S` and replaced it with a fixed-size array `S[MAX_K]`.
2. We added a constant `MAX_K` to specify the maximum value of `K`. You can adjust this value based on the constraints of the problem.
3. In the inner nested loop, we added a check `if (S[j] < 0)` to break out of the loop as soon as we find a negative value in `S[j]`. This avoids unnecessary iterations when the answer is already determined as "No".
