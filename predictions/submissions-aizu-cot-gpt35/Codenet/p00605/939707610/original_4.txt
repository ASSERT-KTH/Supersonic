Step 1: Avoid using unnecessary variables
- The variable `a` is used to store the result of the condition `S[j] < 0`, but it is not necessary. We can directly use the condition in the `if` statement.

Step 2: Avoid dynamic memory allocation
- The original program uses dynamic memory allocation to create an array `S` of size `K`. This can be avoided by using a fixed-size array.

Step 3: Optimize the nested loops
- The nested loops can be optimized by breaking out of the inner loop as soon as `S[j] < 0` is encountered. This will reduce the number of unnecessary iterations.

Optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

const int MAX_K = 100;

int main() {
  int N, K, i, j, S[MAX_K], B;
  
  while (cin >> N >> K, N || K) {
    for (i = 0; i < K; ++i)
      cin >> S[i];
      
    bool a = true;
    
    for (i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
      for (j = 0; j < K; ++j) {
        cin >> B;
        S[j] -= B;
        if (S[j] < 0) {
          a = false;
          break;
        }
      }
    }
    
    cout << (a ? "Yes" : "No") << endl;
  }
}
```

Explanation:
- In the optimized program, I removed the dynamic memory allocation for the array `S` and replaced it with a fixed-size array of size `MAX_K`.
- I removed the variable `a` and replaced it with a boolean variable `a` to store the result of the condition `S[j] < 0`.
- I optimized the nested loops by breaking out of the inner loop as soon as `S[j] < 0` is encountered. This prevents unnecessary iterations.
- Overall, these optimizations improve the running time and memory usage of the program.
