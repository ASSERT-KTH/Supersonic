To optimize the given program, we can make the following improvements:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The program includes the `<algorithm>` header, but it doesn't use any algorithms from it. We can safely remove this include.

2. Remove unnecessary typedef: The program typedefs `long long` as `llong`, but it doesn't use this typedef anywhere. We can safely remove it.

3. Remove unnecessary macro: The program defines `N_MAX` as 500000, but it doesn't use this macro anywhere. We can safely remove it.

4. Optimize the sorting algorithm: The program uses the `sort` function to sort the `art` array. The default sorting algorithm used by `sort` is `introsort`, which has an average time complexity of O(n log n). However, since we are only interested in finding the maximum value, we can use a linear-time sorting algorithm like counting sort. This will reduce the time complexity of the sorting step from O(n log n) to O(n).

5. Optimize the loop: The program uses a loop to calculate the maximum value. We can optimize this loop by removing unnecessary variables and simplifying the calculations.

With these optimizations in mind, here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <stdio.h>

struct Data {
  long long size;
  long long value;
};

void countingSort(Data* art, int N) {
  const int MAX_SIZE = 1000001;
  int counts[MAX_SIZE] = {0};
  for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
    ++counts[art[i].size];
  }
  int index = 0;
  for (int size = 0; size < MAX_SIZE; ++size) {
    while (counts[size] > 0) {
      art[index].size = size;
      ++index;
      --counts[size];
    }
  }
}

int main(void) {
  int N;
  scanf("%d", &N);

  Data art[N];
  for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
    scanf("%lld %lld", &art[i].size, &art[i].value);
  }

  countingSort(art, N);

  long long min_size = art[0].size;
  long long sum_value = art[0].value;
  long long ans = art[0].value;

  for (int i = 1; i < N; ++i) {
    long long value = art[i].value;
    long long size = art[i].size;
    long long tmp = sum_value + value - (size - min_size);
    if (tmp < value) {
      ans = value;
      sum_value = value;
      min_size = size;
    } else {
      ans = tmp;
      sum_value += value;
    }
  }

  printf("%lld\n", ans);
  return 0;
}
```

Explanation of the optimizations:

1. We removed the unnecessary include `<algorithm>` as it is not used in the program.

2. We removed the unused typedef `llong` as it is not used in the program.

3. We removed the unused macro `N_MAX` as it is not used in the program.

4. We implemented a counting sort algorithm instead of using the `sort` function. Counting sort is a linear-time sorting algorithm that is more efficient for this particular case where we only need to sort based on the `size` field.

5. We simplified the loop in the main function by removing unnecessary variables and simplifying the calculations. This makes the code more readable and eliminates redundant operations.
