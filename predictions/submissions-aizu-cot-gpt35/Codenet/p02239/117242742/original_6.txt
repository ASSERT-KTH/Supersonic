Step 1: Remove unnecessary includes.
- The program includes `<iostream>` and `<queue>` but only uses `iostream`. We can remove the `<queue>` include to reduce unnecessary overhead.

Step 2: Optimize the data types.
- The program uses `int` for `n`, `u`, `v`, and `k`. Since these variables represent indices or sizes, we can use `size_t` instead of `int` to improve memory usage.

Step 3: Optimize the data structures.
- The program uses a 2D array `m` to represent a graph. However, this array is declared as `m[105][105]`, which assumes a fixed size of 105 for both dimensions. This limits the program's flexibility and wastes memory. We can use a dynamic data structure, such as an adjacency list, to represent the graph instead. This will allow us to handle graphs of arbitrary sizes.

Step 4: Optimize the BFS algorithm.
- The program uses a `bool` array `v` to keep track of visited vertices. However, this array is declared as `v[105]`, which assumes a fixed size of 105. Similar to the previous step, we can use a dynamic data structure to store the visited vertices. Additionally, we can optimize the BFS algorithm by using a `vector` instead of a `queue` to store the vertices to be visited. This will allow for more efficient memory usage and reduce the overhead of popping elements from the queue.

Step 5: Optimize input/output operations.
- The program uses `cin` and `cout` for input and output operations, respectively. These operations can be slow, especially when dealing with large input/output sizes. We can optimize the input/output operations by using `scanf` and `printf` instead. This will improve the program's running time.

Here is the optimized C++ program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

size_t n;
vector<vector<size_t>> adjList;
vector<bool> visited;
vector<int> distances;

void bfs(size_t s) {
  visited[s] = true;
  distances[s] = 0;
  vector<size_t> q;
  q.push_back(s);
  size_t front = 0;
  while (front < q.size()) {
    size_t u = q[front++];
    for (size_t i = 0; i < adjList[u].size(); i++) {
      size_t v = adjList[u][i];
      if (!visited[v]) {
        distances[v] = distances[u] + 1;
        visited[v] = true;
        q.push_back(v);
      }
    }
  }
}

int main() {
  scanf("%zu", &n);
  adjList.resize(n);
  visited.resize(n, false);
  distances.resize(n, -1);
  for (size_t i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    size_t u, k;
    scanf("%zu %zu", &u, &k);
    u--;
    for (size_t j = 0; j < k; j++) {
      size_t v;
      scanf("%zu", &v);
      v--;
      adjList[u].push_back(v);
    }
  }
  bfs(0);
  for (size_t i = 0; i < n; i++)
    printf("%zu %d\n", i + 1, distances[i]);
  return 0;
}
```

Explanation of the optimization steps:

Step 1: Removed unnecessary includes.
- Removed the `<queue>` include as it was not used in the program.

Step 2: Optimized the data types.
- Changed the data type of `n`, `u`, `v`, and `k` from `int` to `size_t` to better represent indices or sizes.

Step 3: Optimized the data structures.
- Replaced the 2D array `m` with a dynamic adjacency list `adjList` to represent the graph. This allows for handling graphs of arbitrary sizes.

Step 4: Optimized the BFS algorithm.
- Replaced the `bool` array `v` with a `vector<bool>` `visited` to store the visited vertices. Used a `vector<size_t>` `q` instead of a `queue` to store the vertices to be visited. Improved memory usage and reduced overhead when popping elements.

Step 5: Optimized input/output operations.
- Replaced the `cin` and `cout` operations with `scanf` and `printf` for input and output operations, respectively. This improves the program's running time.
