Step 1: Reduce unnecessary memory usage

In the given program, the variable `m` is a 2D array of size 105x105. However, the actual number of vertices `n` can be smaller than 105. This means that a significant portion of the `m` array is unused and takes up unnecessary memory.

To optimize this, we can dynamically allocate memory for the `m` array based on the actual number of vertices `n`. This will reduce the memory usage.

Step 2: Remove unnecessary variable `v`

In the given program, the boolean array `v` is used to keep track of visited vertices. However, this information is already stored in the `d` array. So, we can remove the `v` array and rely solely on the `d` array for visited vertex information.

Step 3: Optimize the BFS loop

In the BFS loop, the program checks if `m[u][i]` is true before proceeding with the BFS operation. However, since `m[u][i]` can only have two values (0 or 1), we can optimize this by directly checking if `m[u][i]` is equal to 1. This will save unnecessary comparisons.

Additionally, we can further optimize the BFS loop by checking if `d[i]` is already assigned a value. If `d[i]` is not -1, it means that `i` has already been visited and there is no need to update its distance value. This will save unnecessary assignments.

Step 4: Optimize the output loop

In the output loop, the program prints `i + 1` and `d[i]` for each vertex. However, instead of adding 1 to `i` for printing, we can initialize `d` array with 0 instead of -1. This way, we can directly use `i` for printing the vertex number without adding 1.
