The given program calculates the number of ways to reach a target value using addition and subtraction operations on a sequence of numbers.

To optimize the program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove the unnecessary initialization of the `dp` array:
   The `dp` array is initialized to 0 in a nested loop, but it is not required because it will be initialized in subsequent iterations. Removing this initialization will save some computation time.

2. Change the loop condition in the second nested loop:
   The loop condition `i < N` should be changed to `i <= N` to include the last element of the array `a`.

3. Use a two-dimensional array instead of a one-dimensional array for `dp`:
   The `dp` array can be modified to have dimensions `[N+1][21]` instead of `[110][21]`. This will save memory by only allocating space for the required number of elements.

4. Remove the `using namespace std` statement:
   It is considered a good practice to avoid using the `using namespace std` statement in global scope to prevent potential naming conflicts.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int a[101];
long long dp[101][21];

int main() {
  int i, j;
  int N;
  std::cin >> N;

  for (i = 1; i <= N; i++) {
    std::cin >> a[i];
  }

  dp[1][a[1]] = 1;

  for (i = 2; i <= N; i++) {
    for (j = 0; j <= 20; j++) {
      if (j - a[i] >= 0)
        dp[i][j] += dp[i - 1][j - a[i]];
      if (j + a[i] <= 20)
        dp[i][j] += dp[i - 1][j + a[i]];
    }
  }

  std::cout << dp[N][a[N]] << std::endl;
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized program eliminates unnecessary initialization, reduces memory usage, and improves readability by removing the `using namespace std` statement.
