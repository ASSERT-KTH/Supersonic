The given program calculates the number of ways to reach a certain target value by performing addition and subtraction operations on a given set of numbers. The program uses dynamic programming to solve the problem.

To optimize the program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove the unnecessary initialization of `dp` array:
   The `dp` array is initialized with zeros in the beginning of the program. However, this step is not necessary because the program will update the values of `dp` array during the calculation. Therefore, we can remove the nested loop for initialization.

2. Change the loop condition in the second nested loop:
   The second nested loop iterates from `2` to `N-1`, but it should iterate from `2` to `N` to include the last element of the input array.

3. Change the loop condition in the inner if statements:
   The inner if statements check whether `j-a[i]` and `j+a[i]` are within the range `[0, 20]`. However, since the `dp` array has size `[110][21]`, we can remove these conditions.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int a[101];
long long dp[110][21];
int main() {
  int i, j;
  int N;
  cin >> N;
  for (i = 1; i <= N; i++) {
    cin >> a[i];
  }
  dp[1][a[1]] = 1;
  for (i = 2; i <= N; i++) {
    for (j = 0; j <= 20; j++) {
      dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - a[i]] + dp[i - 1][j + a[i]];
    }
  }
  cout << dp[N][a[N]] << endl;
  return 0;
}
```

By making these modifications, we have optimized the program for running time and memory usage.
