The given program computes the number of ways to reach a target value by performing addition or subtraction operations on a given set of numbers. The algorithm uses dynamic programming to build a table of intermediate results.

To optimize the program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove the unnecessary initialization of the `dp` array in the beginning. Since the array is already declared as a global variable, it is automatically initialized with zeros.

2. Change the loop condition in the second `for` loop from `i < N` to `i <= N`. This ensures that the loop includes the last element of the `a` array.

3. Remove the `using namespace std;` statement and explicitly specify the `std::` namespace for standard library functions and types. This helps avoid potential naming conflicts.

With these optimizations, the optimized program is as follows:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int a[101];
long long dp[110][21];

int main() {
  int i, j;
  int N;
  std::cin >> N;
  
  for (i = 1; i <= N; i++) {
    std::cin >> a[i];
  }
  
  dp[1][a[1]] = 1;
  
  for (i = 2; i <= N; i++) {
    for (j = 0; j <= 20; j++) {
      if (j - a[i] >= 0)
        dp[i][j] += dp[i - 1][j - a[i]];
      if (j + a[i] <= 20)
        dp[i][j] += dp[i - 1][j + a[i]];
    }
  }
  
  std::cout << dp[N][a[N]] << std::endl;
  return 0;
}
```

These optimizations should improve the running time and memory usage of the program.
