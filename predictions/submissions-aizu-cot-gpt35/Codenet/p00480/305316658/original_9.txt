The given C++ program calculates the number of ways to reach a certain sum using the numbers in the array `a`. The dynamic programming approach is used to fill the `dp` array, where `dp[i][j]` represents the number of ways to reach the sum `j` using the first `i` elements of the array.

To optimize the program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove the unnecessary initialization of the `dp` array:
   The `dp` array is initialized to zero in a nested loop. However, this is unnecessary because the array is already initialized to zero by default when it is declared as a global variable.

2. Change the loop condition in the second nested loop:
   The loop condition `i < N` should be modified to `i <= N` to include the last element of the array `a` in the calculations.

3. Optimize the innermost loop:
   The innermost loop can be optimized by using a temporary variable to store the value of `dp[i - 1][j]` to avoid repeated memory access.

Here is the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int a[101];
long long dp[110][21];

int main() {
  int N;
  cin >> N;

  for (int i = 1; i <= N; i++) {
    cin >> a[i];
  }

  dp[1][a[1]] = 1;

  for (int i = 2; i <= N; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j <= 20; j++) {
      long long prev = dp[i - 1][j];
      
      if (j - a[i] >= 0)
        dp[i][j] += prev;
      if (j + a[i] <= 20)
        dp[i][j] += prev;
    }
  }

  cout << dp[N][a[N]] << endl;
  return 0;
}
```

These optimizations should improve the running time and reduce unnecessary memory operations.
