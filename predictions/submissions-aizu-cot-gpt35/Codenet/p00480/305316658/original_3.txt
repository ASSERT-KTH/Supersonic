The given program calculates the number of ways to reach a target value by adding or subtracting the elements of the array `a[]`. The program uses dynamic programming to store the intermediate results in the 2D array `dp[][]`. 

To optimize the program, we can make the following improvements:

1. Remove the unnecessary initialization of `dp[][]` to zero:
   - The program unnecessarily initializes `dp[][]` to zero using a nested loop. However, the subsequent calculations already update the array elements, so this initialization step can be skipped.

2. Optimize the loop boundaries:
   - The loop `for (i = 2; i < N; i++)` should be modified to `for (i = 2; i <= N; i++)`. This ensures that the loop runs for `N` iterations, including the last element of the array.

3. Optimize the loop conditions:
   - The condition `j <= 20` in the nested loop `for (j = 0; j <= 20; j++)` can be simplified to `j < 21` to have the same effect.

4. Use a 1D array instead of a 2D array:
   - Since the values of `dp[i][j]` only depend on the previous row `dp[i-1][j-a[i]]` and `dp[i-1][j+a[i]]`, we can optimize memory usage by using a 1D array `dp[]` instead of a 2D array. We can update the values of `dp[]` in a single loop, without the need for a nested loop.

Here's the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

const int MAX_N = 101;
const int MAX_SUM = 21;
int a[MAX_N];
long long dp[MAX_SUM];

int main() {
  int N;
  cin >> N;
  
  for (int i = 1; i <= N; i++) {
    cin >> a[i];
  }
  
  dp[a[1]] = 1;
  for (int i = 2; i <= N; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j < MAX_SUM; j++) {
      if (j - a[i] >= 0)
        dp[j] += dp[j - a[i]];
      if (j + a[i] < MAX_SUM)
        dp[j] += dp[j + a[i]];
    }
  }
  
  cout << dp[a[N]] << endl;
  return 0;
}
```

By optimizing the loop boundaries and conditions, and using a 1D array instead of a 2D array, we have reduced the memory usage and improved the running time of the program.
