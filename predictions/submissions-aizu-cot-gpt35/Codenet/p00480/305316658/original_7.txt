The given code calculates the number of ways to reach a target sum by performing addition and subtraction operations on a given set of numbers. It uses a dynamic programming approach to solve the problem.

To optimize this code, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove the unnecessary initialization of the `dp` array: The `dp` array is initialized to all zeros in the original code using a nested loop. However, this initialization is not required because all elements of the `dp` array will be updated in the subsequent loops.

2. Adjust the loop limits: The loop limits for the outer loop can be modified to iterate until `N-1` instead of `N` in order to avoid unnecessary iterations.

3. Modify the inner loop limit: The inner loop limit can be modified to iterate until `j <= 20 - a[i]` instead of `j <= 20` to avoid unnecessary iterations. This is because once `j + a[i]` exceeds 20, there is no need to perform further calculations.

4. Use a 2D array of size `[2][21]` instead of `[110][21]`: Since we only need the previous row (`dp[i-1][j]`) to calculate the current row (`dp[i][j]`), we can optimize the memory usage by using a 2D array of size `[2][21]` instead of `[110][21]`. This will reduce the memory usage significantly.

Here's the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int a[101];
  long long dp[2][21] = {0}; // Use a 2D array of size [2][21]
  int N;
  cin >> N;
  
  for (int i = 1; i <= N; i++) {
    cin >> a[i];
  }
  
  dp[1][a[1]] = 1;
  
  for (int i = 2; i < N; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j <= 20 - a[i]; j++) { // Adjusted inner loop limit
      if (j - a[i] >= 0)
        dp[i % 2][j] += dp[(i - 1) % 2][j - a[i]]; // Use modulo operator to access previous row
      if (j + a[i] <= 20)
        dp[i % 2][j] += dp[(i - 1) % 2][j + a[i]]; // Use modulo operator to access previous row
    }
  }
  
  cout << dp[(N - 1) % 2][a[N]] << endl; // Use modulo operator to access last row
  
  return 0;
}
```

Explanation of Optimizations:
1. We removed the unnecessary initialization of the `dp` array because all elements will be updated in the subsequent loops.
2. We adjusted the loop limits to avoid unnecessary iterations.
3. We modified the inner loop limit to avoid unnecessary calculations.
4. We used a 2D array of size `[2][21]` instead of `[110][21]` to optimize memory usage.
