Step 1: Remove unnecessary includes:
- The code includes the entire `bits/stdc++.h` library, which is not necessary and can slow down compile time. We can remove this include statement.

Step 2: Optimize the sorting algorithm:
- The code uses `sort()` to sort the `book` array in descending order. This sorting algorithm has a time complexity of O(n log n). However, we can optimize this step by using a counting sort algorithm since the range of the values in the `book` array is small (between 0 and 1000). Counting sort has a time complexity of O(n).
- The counting sort algorithm works by counting the occurrence of each value and then reconstructing the sorted array based on the counts. In this case, we will count the occurrences of each pair (book[i].f, book[i].s), and then reconstruct the sorted array.

Step 3: Optimize the dynamic programming loop:
- The code uses a dynamic programming loop (nested for loop) to calculate the maximum value of `dp`. However, we can optimize this step by using a single loop and a rolling array.
- The rolling array technique works by using two arrays of size `d+1`, and updating the values in the second array based on the values in the first array. This way, we can calculate the maximum value of `dp` without using nested loops.

Step 4: Return the optimized program
