Step 1: Remove unnecessary includes
The program includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header, which is not standard C++. It is better to include only the necessary headers.

Step 2: Remove unnecessary macros
The program defines macros for `first` and `second` of the `pair` class. It is better to use the member access operator (`.`) directly.

Step 3: Optimize sum calculation
The program calculates the sum of `book[i].f` and `book[i].s` in each iteration of the loop. We can optimize this by calculating the sums only once before the loop.

Step 4: Optimize the inner loop
The program uses a nested loop to update the `dp` array. We can optimize this by starting the inner loop from a different index and using a temporary variable to store the result of `dp[j]`.

Step 5: Optimize the while loop
The program uses a while loop to find the maximum value of `D` such that `dp[D]` is true. We can optimize this by using a for loop instead.

Step 6: Optimize the sorting
The program sorts the `book` array using the `greater` comparison function. We can optimize this by using a custom comparison function.

Step 7: Use `std::vector` instead of fixed-size arrays
The program uses fixed-size arrays for `book` and `dp`. We can optimize this by using `std::vector` instead, which can dynamically resize itself.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

struct Book {
    int f;
    int s;
};

bool cmp(const Book& a, const Book& b) {
    return a.f > b.f;
}

int solve(const std::vector<Book>& books) {
    int sumf = 0, sums = 0;
    for (const auto& book : books) {
        sumf += book.f;
        sums += book.s;
    }
    if (2 * books[0].f <= sumf)
        return sumf + sums;

    int d = 2 * books[0].f - sumf;
    std::vector<int> dp(d + 1, 0);
    dp[0] = 1;

    for (int i = 0; i < books.size(); i++) {
        for (int j = d - books[i].s; j >= 0; j--) {
            int temp = dp[j];
            dp[j + books[i].s] |= temp;
        }
    }

    int D = d;
    for (int i = d; i >= 0; i--) {
        if (dp[i]) {
            D = i;
            break;
        }
    }

    return sumf + sums + (d - D);
}

int main() {
    int n;
    while (std::cin >> n && n) {
        std::vector<Book> books(n);
        for (auto& book : books)
            std::cin >> book.f >> book.s;
        std::sort(books.begin(), books.end(), cmp);
        std::cout << solve(books) << std::endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
```
