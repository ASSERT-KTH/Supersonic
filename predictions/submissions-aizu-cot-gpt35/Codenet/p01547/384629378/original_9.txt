To optimize the given program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The program includes the entire `bits/stdc++.h` header, which is not necessary. We can remove it since it is not used in the program.

2. Remove unnecessary typedefs: The program defines several typedefs such as `D`, `P`, `L`, `VP`, and `Vcon`. However, these typedefs are not used in the program. We can remove them to reduce unnecessary code.

3. Remove unnecessary namespace: The program defines a custom `std` namespace to overload the `<` operator for the `P` struct. However, this overload is not used in the program. We can remove the custom namespace to simplify the code.

4. Replace throw statement with an exception: The program uses a throw statement with a string message. Instead of using a throw statement, we can use a standard exception class such as `std::runtime_error` to throw an exception with a meaningful error message.

5. Change the sorting algorithm: The program uses the `sort` function from the `<algorithm>` header to sort the `ps` vector. We can replace this with a more efficient sorting algorithm, such as `std::sort` or `std::stable_sort`, which have better time complexity guarantees.

6. Remove unnecessary resizing of the `ch` vector: The program resizes the `ch` vector to `k - 1` at the end of the `convexHull` function. However, this resizing is not necessary since the `k` value is already the correct size of the `ch` vector.

7. Optimize the `divide_convex` function: The `divide_convex` function uses recursion to divide the convex polygon. However, this recursive approach can be inefficient for large input sizes. We can optimize this function by using an iterative approach, such as using a stack to store the convex polygons to be divided.

8. Optimize the `Convex_arrangement` function: The `Convex_arrangement` function uses a nested loop to check for intersections between convex polygons. This can be a slow operation, especially for large input sizes. We can optimize this function by using a more efficient algorithm, such as the Bentley-Ottmann algorithm, to find the intersections between the convex polygons.

9. Optimize the `con_in_con` function: The `con_in_con` function uses nested loops to check for intersections between the input convex polygons. We can optimize this function by using a more efficient algorithm, such as the separating axis theorem, to check for intersections between convex polygons.

10. Optimize the `inPolygon` function: The `inPolygon` function uses a loop to check if a point is inside a polygon. We can optimize this function by using the winding number algorithm, which has a better time complexity for large polygons.

11. Use more descriptive variable names: Some of the variable names in the program are not descriptive and can be confusing. We can use more meaningful variable names to improve code readability.

Here is the optimized C++ program:

#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

    return (conj(a) * b).imag();

    b -= a;
    c -= a;
    if (cross(b, c) > EPS)
        return +1;

        return -1;
    if (dot(b, c) < -EPS)
        return +2;
    if (norm(b) < norm(c))
        return -2;
    return 0;
