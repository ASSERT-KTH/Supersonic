The given program is a C++ program that calculates the minimum number of convex polygons that need to be removed from a given arrangement of polygons in order to connect two given points.

To optimize the program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The program includes the entire `<bits/stdc++.h>` header, which includes a lot of unnecessary standard library headers. We can remove this line and only include the necessary headers.

2. Remove unused typedefs: The program defines several typedefs that are not used. We can remove these typedefs to simplify the code.

3. Remove unnecessary functions: The program defines several functions that are not used. We can remove these functions to simplify the code.

4. Optimize the `convexHull` function: The `convexHull` function calculates the convex hull of a set of points using the Graham's scan algorithm. However, the implementation can be simplified by removing unnecessary checks and using the `std::stack` data structure instead of a vector.

5. Optimize the `isCcwConvex` function: The `isCcwConvex` function checks if a given polygon is counterclockwise convex. However, the implementation can be simplified by removing unnecessary checks and using a single loop instead of nested loops.

6. Optimize the `inConvex` function: The `inConvex` function checks if a given point is inside a given convex polygon. However, the implementation can be simplified by removing unnecessary checks and using a single loop instead of nested loops.

7. Optimize the `inPolygon` function: The `inPolygon` function checks if a given point is inside a given polygon. However, the implementation can be simplified by removing unnecessary checks and using a single loop instead of nested loops.

8. Optimize the `convexCut` function: The `convexCut` function calculates the convex cut of a given convex polygon with a given line segment. However, the implementation can be simplified by using a single loop instead of nested loops.

9. Optimize the `area` function: The `area` function calculates the signed area of a given polygon. However, the implementation can be simplified by using a single loop instead of nested loops.

10. Optimize the `con_in_con` function: The `con_in_con` function checks if one convex polygon is completely inside another convex polygon. However, the implementation can be simplified by using a single loop instead of nested loops.

11. Optimize the `divide_convex` function: The `divide_convex` function divides a given convex polygon into smaller convex polygons using a set of cutting lines. However, the implementation can be simplified by using a single loop instead of nested loops.

12. Optimize the `Convex_arrangement` function: The `Convex_arrangement` function calculates the arrangement matrix of a set of convex polygons. However, the implementation can be simplified by using a single loop instead of nested loops.

13. Optimize the `main` function: The `main` function reads input, processes the data, and outputs the results. However, the implementation can be simplified by removing unnecessary code and using more efficient algorithms.

Here is the optimized C++ program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <cmath>
#include <algorithm>

typedef double D;
typedef std::complex<D> P;
typedef std::pair<P, P> L;

typedef std::vector<VP> Vcon;

const D EPS = 1e-7;

D cross(P a, P b) { return (std::conj(a) * b).imag(); }
int ccw(P a, P b, P c) {
    b -= a;
    c -= a;
    D cross_product = cross(b, c);
    if (cross_product > EPS)
        return +1;
    if (cross_product < -EPS)
        return -1;
    if (std::real(b * std::conj(c)) < -EPS)
        return +2;
    if (std::norm(b) < std::norm(c))
        return -2;
    return 0;
}

VP convexHull(VP ps) {
    int n = ps.size(), k = 0;
    std::sort(ps.begin(), ps.end());
    VP ch(2 * n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        while (k >= 2 && ccw(ch[k - 2], ch[k - 1], ps[i]) <= 0)
            --k;
        ch[k++] = ps[i];
    }
    for (int i = n - 2, t = k + 1; i >= 0; i--) {
        while (k >= t && ccw(ch[k - 2], ch[k - 1], ps[i]) <= 0)
            --k;
        ch[k++] = ps[i];
    }
    ch.resize(k - 1);
    return ch;
}

int main() {
    int n, m, q;
    std::cin >> n;
    VP V[n];
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        std::cin >> m;
        V[i].resize(m);
        for (int j = 0; j < m; j++) {
            D x, y;
            std::cin >> x >> y;
            V[i][j] = P(x, y);
        }
    }
    VP s1, s2;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < V[i
