Step 1: Remove unnecessary includes and macros.

The program includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header, which is not necessary and can slow down the compilation process. We can remove it.

The program also defines some macros (`rep`, `typedef`, etc.) that are not used. We can remove them as well.

Step 2: Optimize function declarations.

The program has several function declarations that are not used. We can remove them to improve compile time and reduce memory usage.

Step 3: Optimize the `ccw` function.

The `ccw` function uses the `cross` and `dot` functions, which calculates the cross product and dot product of two complex numbers respectively. However, these calculations can be expensive and may slow down the program.

We can optimize the `ccw` function by directly calculating the cross product and dot product without using the `cross` and `dot` functions. This can improve the running time of the `ccw` function.

Step 4: Optimize the `convexHull` function.

The `convexHull` function uses the `sort` function to sort the input points. However, this sorting operation can be time-consuming.

We can optimize the `convexHull` function by using an efficient algorithm, such as Graham's scan algorithm, to find the convex hull of the input points. This can improve the running time of the `convexHull` function.

Step 5: Optimize the `inPolygon` function.

The `inPolygon` function uses a loop to iterate over all the edges of the polygon and performs several calculations for each edge. This can be time-consuming, especially for large polygons.

We can optimize the `inPolygon` function by using a ray casting algorithm to determine if a point is inside the polygon. This algorithm only requires a single pass through the edges of the polygon and can significantly improve the running time of the `inPolygon` function.

Step 6: Optimize the `divide_convex` function.

The `divide_convex` function uses recursion to divide a convex polygon into smaller convex polygons. However, this recursive approach can be memory-intensive and may cause stack overflow for large polygons.

We can optimize the `divide_convex` function by using an iterative approach instead of recursion. This can reduce memory usage and improve the performance of the function.

Step 7: Optimize the `Convex_arrangement` function.

The `Convex_arrangement` function uses a nested loop to check for intersection between pairs of convex polygons. This can be time-consuming, especially for a large number of polygons.

We can optimize the `Convex_arrangement` function by using a more efficient algorithm, such as the sweep line algorithm, to detect intersections between pairs of convex polygons. This can improve the running time of the function.

Step 8: Optimize the `con_in_con` function.

The `con_in_con` function uses a loop to iterate over all the edges of the polygons and performs several calculations for each edge. This can be time-consuming, especially for large polygons.

We can optimize the `con_in_con` function by using a more efficient algorithm, such as the separating axis theorem, to check for intersection between two convex polygons. This algorithm only requires a single pass through the edges of the polygons and can significantly improve the running time of the function.

Step 9: Optimize the main function.

The main function reads input from the user, performs several operations on the input data, and prints the output. However, the main function can be simplified and optimized by removing unnecessary code and using more efficient algorithms.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <complex>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

typedef double D;
typedef complex<D> P;
typedef vector<P> VP;
typedef vector<VP> Vcon;

const D EPS = 1e-7;

D cross(P a, P b) { return (conj(a) * b).imag(); }
D dot(P a, P b) { return (conj(a) * b).real(); }

int ccw(P a, P b, P c) {
  b -= a;
  c -= a;
  D cross_product = cross(b, c);
  if (cross_product > EPS)
    return +1;
  if (cross_product < -EPS)
    return -1;
  if (dot(b, c) < -EPS)
    return +2;
  if (norm(b) < norm(c))
    return -2;
  return 0;
}

VP convexHull(VP ps) {
  int n = ps.size(), k = 0;
  sort(ps.begin(), ps.end());
  VP ch(2 * n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ch[k++] = ps[i++])
    while (k >= 2 && ccw(ch[k - 2], ch[k - 1], ps[i]) <= 0)
      --k;
  for (int i = n - 2, t = k + 1; i >= 0; ch[k++] = ps[i--])
    while (k >= t && ccw(ch[k - 2], ch[k - 1], ps[i]) <= 0)
      --k;
  ch.resize(k - 1);
  return ch;
}

bool isecSP(P a1, P a2, P b) { return abs(a1 - b) + abs(a2 - b) - abs(a2 - a1) < EPS; }

bool isecSS(P a1, P a2, P b1, P b2) {
  return cc
