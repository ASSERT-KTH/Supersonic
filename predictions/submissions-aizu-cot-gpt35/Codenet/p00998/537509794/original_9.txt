The given program is an implementation of an AVL tree, which is a self-balancing binary search tree. The program reads an input consisting of the number of elements in the tree and a sequence of queries. Each query can be one of three types:

1. Insert a value at a specific position in the tree.
2. Find the minimum value in a range of positions in the tree.
3. Update the value at a specific position in the tree.

To optimize the program for running time and memory usage, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary header inclusion: The program includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header, which is not necessary and can be replaced with specific headers that are needed.

2. Avoid unnecessary copying of nodes: In the `insert` and `erase` functions of the AVL tree, the program creates new nodes for each insertion or deletion. This can be avoided by using pointers to the existing nodes instead of creating new ones.

3. Avoid unnecessary updates: In the `erase` function of the AVL tree, the program updates the nodes unnecessarily after deletion. This can be avoided by not updating the nodes that are being deleted.

4. Avoid unnecessary find operations: In the `find` function of the AVL tree, the program performs unnecessary find operations on the left and right subtrees. This can be avoided by checking if the desired range is completely covered by the left or right subtree, and returning the appropriate value without further recursion.

5. Use `std::vector` instead of `avl_tree`: The AVL tree implementation in the program can be replaced with `std::vector` to simplify the code and improve performance. The vector can store the values directly and use the built-in functions for insertion, deletion, and finding the minimum value in a range.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

struct RMQ {
  using type = int;
  static type id() { return INT_MAX; }
  static type op(type l, type r) { return std::min(l, r); }
};

int main() {
  std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  std::cin.tie(0);

  int n, q;
  std::cin >> n >> q;

  std::vector<RMQ::type> tree(n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    std::cin >> tree[i];
  }

  while (q--) {
    int x, y, z;
    std::cin >> x >> y >> z;

    if (x == 0) {
      int val = tree[z];
      tree.erase(tree.begin() + z);
      tree.insert(tree.begin() + y, val);
    } else if (x == 1) {
      std::cout << *std::min_element(tree.begin() + y, tree.begin() + z + 1) << "\n";
    } else {
      tree[y] = z;
    }
  }

  return 0;
}
```

Explanation of the optimization steps:

1. The unnecessary header inclusion `<bits/stdc++.h>` is removed and replaced with specific headers that are needed (`<iostream>`, `<vector>`, `<algorithm>`).

2. The AVL tree implementation is replaced with a `std::vector` named `tree`. This simplifies the code and improves performance because `std::vector` has built-in functions for insertion, deletion, and finding the minimum value in a range.

3. The unnecessary copying of nodes is avoided by directly accessing the elements of the `std::vector` instead of creating new nodes.

4. The unnecessary updates in the `erase` function are avoided by not updating the elements that are being deleted.

5. The unnecessary find operations in the `find` function are avoided by using `std::min_element` to find the minimum value in a range.

These modifications optimize the program for both running time and memory usage.
