The given program can be optimized by using a different approach to calculate the maximum value of `ans`. Instead of iterating through all the elements of `p` and checking if adding the element to `sum` will satisfy the condition, we can use a sliding window technique to find the maximum value of `ans`.

Here are the steps to optimize the program:

1. Remove the unnecessary `#include` statements and macro definitions.

2. Remove the unnecessary variable `n` and use `n` as the size of the array `a`.

3. Remove the unnecessary `use` array. Instead, we can use a `visited` array of size `n` to keep track of the visited elements.

4. Remove the unnecessary variables `id` and `num`. Instead, we can keep track of the current sum and the maximum sum using variables `curSum` and `maxSum`.

5. Remove the unnecessary variable `sum`. Instead, we can calculate the sum of all elements in `a` using a variable `totalSum`.

6. Sort the array `a` in non-decreasing order and initialize `curSum` and `maxSum` as `totalSum`.

7. Iterate through the array `a` and calculate `curSum` and `maxSum` by subtracting the current element from `curSum` and comparing it with `maxSum`.

8. Print `maxSum` as the answer.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

typedef long long ll;

int main() {
    cin.tie(0);
    ios::sync_with_stdio(0);

    int n;
    cin >> n;

    ll a[n];
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        cin >> a[i];
    }

    sort(a, a + n);

    ll totalSum = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        totalSum += a[i];
    }

    ll curSum = totalSum;
    ll maxSum = totalSum;

    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        curSum -= a[i];
        maxSum = max(maxSum, (i + 1) * a[i] + curSum);
    }

    cout << maxSum << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

The optimized program eliminates unnecessary variables, reduces the number of iterations, and uses a sliding window technique to calculate the maximum value of `maxSum`. This should result in improved running time and memory usage.
