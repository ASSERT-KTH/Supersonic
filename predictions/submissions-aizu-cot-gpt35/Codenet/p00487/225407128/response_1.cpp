Step 1: Avoid unnecessary includes
The program includes the `<algorithm>` and `<map>` headers, but these are not used in the code. Therefore, we can remove these unnecessary includes to improve compilation time.

Step 2: Remove unnecessary typedefs
The program defines a typedef `typedef long long ll`, but `ll` is not used in the code. We can remove this typedef to simplify the code.

Step 3: Remove unnecessary preprocessor directives
The program defines `#define fs first` and `#define sc second`, but these are not used in the code. We can remove these unnecessary preprocessor directives to simplify the code.

Step 4: Optimize input/output operations
The program uses `cin.tie(0)` and `std::ios::sync_with_stdio(0)` to optimize the input/output operations. However, these optimizations are not necessary for this specific program. We can remove these lines to simplify the code.

Step 5: Optimize sorting
The program sorts the arrays `p` and `b` using the `sort` function. However, the default sorting algorithm used by `sort` is not the most efficient for this specific case. We can replace the `sort` function with a more efficient sorting algorithm, such as `std::stable_sort`, which has a lower time complexity for nearly sorted arrays.

Step 6: Optimize memory usage
The program uses three arrays of size 300010 (`p`, `b`, `use`) and one array of size `n` (`a`). However, the value of `n` is not known until runtime. To optimize memory usage, we can dynamically allocate memory for these arrays using the `new` operator. This way, we can allocate memory based on the actual value of `n` at runtime.

Step 7: Modify the code based on the optimizations
