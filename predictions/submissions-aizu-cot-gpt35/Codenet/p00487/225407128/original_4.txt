The given C/C++ program seems to solve a problem involving sorting and manipulating arrays. To optimize the program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary header files: The program includes the `<algorithm>` and `<map>` header files, but they are not used in the code. We can safely remove them.

2. Remove unnecessary macros: The program defines macros `fs` and `sc` which are not used. We can safely remove them.

3. Optimize input/output operations: The program includes some input/output optimizations, such as `cin.tie(0)` and `std::ios::sync_with_stdio(0)`. These optimizations can improve the performance of input/output operations. We will keep them in the optimized program.

4. Remove unnecessary arrays: The program declares and initializes two arrays `p` and `use`, but they are not used. We can safely remove them.

5. Optimize sorting: The program sorts two arrays `p` and `b` using the `sort` function. However, we can optimize the sorting process by removing the unnecessary sorting of array `p`. Since array `p` is sorted only to find the elements that are less than or equal to the elements in array `b`, we can use two pointers to iterate over the arrays, avoiding the need for sorting.

6. Optimize memory usage: The program declares three arrays `a`, `p`, and `b` with a size of 300010, which might be excessive given the input constraint of `n`. We can optimize the memory usage by declaring these arrays with a size of `n` instead.

7. Optimize the main loop: The main loop of the program can be optimized by removing unnecessary checks and calculations. We can simplify the loop conditions and remove the inner while loops. Instead, we can use a single loop and update the variables `sum`, `num`, and `ans` accordingly.

Here is the optimized C/C++ program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;
typedef long long ll;

int main() {
  cin.tie(0);
  std::ios::sync_with_stdio(0);
  
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  
  vector<ll> a(n), b(n);
  vector<bool> use(n, false);
  
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> a[i] >> b[i];
  }
  
  int ans = 0;
  ll sum = 0;
  int num = 0;
  
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    if (!use[i]) {
      sum += a[i];
      use[i] = true;
      num++;
    }
    
    if (sum > num * b[i]) {
      sum -= a[i];
      num--;
      continue;
    }
    
    ans = max(ans, num);
  }
  
  cout << ans << endl;
}
```

This optimized program eliminates unnecessary sorting and arrays, resulting in improved running time and reduced memory usage.
