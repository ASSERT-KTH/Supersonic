Step 1: Eliminate unnecessary includes
- The program includes `<iostream>` and `<limits.h>`, but it does not use any functionality from these headers. Therefore, we can remove these unnecessary includes.

Step 2: Optimize variable types
- The program uses `ll` as an alias for `long long`, but it does not actually use the full range of `long long`. Since the variables `N`, `Q`, `T`, and array sizes are all of type `int`, we can change the alias to `int` to save memory.

Step 3: Optimize array sizes
- The program declares two arrays, `people` and `A`, with fixed sizes of 1001 and 100001 respectively. However, these sizes are not necessary and can be reduced to the actual input size. We can modify these array declarations to use dynamic allocation based on the input size.

Step 4: Optimize loop iterations
- The program uses a loop to read the input values for arrays `A` and `D`. Instead of looping `N` times, we can modify the loop to iterate until the input is exhausted or until a maximum size is reached. This will save unnecessary iterations and improve efficiency.

Step 5: Avoid unnecessary calculations
- Inside the loop, the program calculates `abs(t - A[people[i]])` and `abs(A[people[i]] - t)` multiple times, even though the values of `t` and `A[people[i]]` remain the same for each iteration. We can calculate these values only once and store them in separate variables to avoid redundant calculations.

Step 6: Optimize output
- The program currently outputs each result using `cout` directly inside the loop. This can be inefficient for large output sizes. Instead, we can store the results in a separate array and output them outside the loop.

Here is the optimized C++ program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int N, Q, T;
  cin >> N >> T >> Q;
  
  int* people = new int[Q];
  int* A = new int[N];
  int* D = new int[N];
  
  for (int i = 0; i < N && i < 100001; i++) {
    cin >> A[i] >> D[i];
  }
  
  for (int i = 0; i < Q; i++) {
    cin >> people[i];
    people[i]--;
  }
  
  int east = INT_MIN;
  int west = INT_MIN;
  int t;
  
  int* results = new int[Q];
  
  for (int i = 0; i < Q; i++) {
    if (D[people[i]] == 1) {
      east = A[people[i]];
      for (int j = people[i] + 1; j < N; j++) {
        if (D[j] == 1) {
          east = A[j];
        } else {
          t = (east + A[j]) / 2;
          break;
        }
      }
      int diff = abs(t - A[people[i]]);
      results[i] = (T < diff) ? (A[people[i]] + T) : t;
    } else {
      west = A[people[i]];
      for (int j = people[i] - 1; j >= 0; j--) {
        if (D[j] == 1) {
          t = (west + A[j]) / 2;
          break;
        } else {
          west = A[j];
        }
      }
      int diff = abs(A[people[i]] - t);
      results[i] = (T < diff) ? (A[people[i]] - T) : t;
    }
  }
  
  for (int i = 0; i < Q; i++) {
    cout << results[i] << endl;
  }
  
  delete[] people;
  delete[] A;
  delete[] D;
  delete[] results;
  
  return 0;
}
```

Explanation:
- The optimized program eliminates unnecessary includes, optimizes variable types, reduces array sizes, optimizes loop iterations, avoids unnecessary calculations, and optimizes output.
- It dynamically allocates memory for arrays `people`, `A`, `D`, and `results` based on the input size.
- It modifies the loop iterations to be based on the actual input size or a maximum size if specified.
- It calculates `abs(t - A[people[i]])` and `abs(A[people[i]] - t)` only once inside the loop and stores the results in separate variables for efficiency.
- It stores the output results in the `results` array and outputs them outside the loop.
- It deallocates the dynamically allocated memory before returning from the program.
