Optimization step by step:

1. Remove unnecessary header files: The program includes the `<iostream>` and `<limits.h>` header files, but none of their functionalities are used in the program. Therefore, we can remove these unnecessary includes.

2. Remove unused variable: The variable `MIN` is defined but not used anywhere in the program. We can remove this variable declaration.

3. Optimize loop bounds: The loops in the program iterate `N` and `Q` times, respectively. However, the arrays `A` and `D` have sizes larger than `N`, and the array `people` has size larger than `Q`. We can change the loop bounds to iterate only up to the actual number of elements in these arrays.

4. Remove unnecessary variable initialization: The variables `east`, `west`, and `t` are initialized with `MIN` at the beginning of the program, but their values are overwritten inside the loop. We can remove these unnecessary initializations.

5. Avoid unnecessary division: Inside the loop, there are divisions performed to calculate the average of two values. However, we can optimize this by using a bitwise shift operation instead, which is faster than division. By dividing by 2 using a right shift operation, we can replace `(east + A[j]) / 2` with `(east + A[j]) >> 1`, and `(west + A[j]) / 2` with `(west + A[j]) >> 1`.

6. Use `std::endl` carefully: The program uses `std::endl` to end each line of output. However, `std::endl` not only inserts a newline character but also flushes the output buffer, which can be costly in terms of performance. We can replace `std::endl` with the newline character `'\n'` to avoid unnecessary buffer flushing.

7. Use `'\n'` instead of `endl` in `cout`: Since `std::endl` flushes the output buffer, it is more efficient to use `'\n'` instead when there is no explicit need for flushing.

8. Avoid repeated calculations: Inside the loop, the program calculates `abs(t - A[people[i]])` and `abs(A[people[i]] - t)` multiple times. We can optimize this by calculating these values only once and storing them in variables.

Optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;
using ll = long long;

int main() {
  int N, Q;
  ll T;
  cin >> N >> T >> Q;
  ll people[1001];
  ll A[100001];
  int D[100001];
  for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
    cin >> A[i] >> D[i];
  }
  for (int i = 0; i < Q; i++) {
    cin >> people[i];
    people[i]--;
  }
  
  ll east, west, t;
  for (int i = 0; i < Q; i++) {
    if (D[people[i]] == 1) {
      east = A[people[i]];
      for (ll j = people[i] + 1; j < N; j++) {
        if (D[j] == 1) {
          east = A[j];
        } else {
          t = (east + A[j]) >> 1;
          break;
        }
      }
      ll diff = abs(t - A[people[i]]);
      if (T < diff) {
        cout << A[people[i]] + T << '\n';
      } else {
        cout << t << '\n';
      }
    } else {
      west = A[people[i]];
      for (ll j = people[i] - 1; j >= 0; j--) {
        if (D[j] == 1) {
          t = (west + A[j]) >> 1;
          break;
        } else {
          west = A[j];
        }
      }
      ll diff = abs(A[people[i]] - t);
      if (T < diff) {
        cout << A[people[i]] - T << '\n';
      } else {
        cout << t << '\n';
      }
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
