The given program can be optimized in several ways:

1. Remove unnecessary header files: The program includes the `<iostream>` and `<limits.h>` header files, but it only uses `std::cin` and `std::cout` from `<iostream>`. Therefore, we can remove the `<limits.h>` header file.

2. Remove unnecessary `using namespace std;` statement: The program only uses `std::cin` and `std::cout`, so we can remove the `using namespace std;` statement and use the `std::` prefix when accessing `cin` and `cout`.

3. Use `constexpr` instead of `const`: The constant `MIN` is defined as `const ll MIN = -(LONG_LONG_MAX - 1);`. Since `LONG_LONG_MAX` is a compile-time constant, we can use `constexpr` instead of `const` to ensure that `MIN` is evaluated at compile time.

4. Optimize memory usage: The arrays `people`, `A`, and `D` have fixed sizes of 1001 and 100001, respectively. However, the program only uses the first `N` elements of `A` and `D`, and the first `Q` elements of `people`. We can optimize memory usage by reducing the size of these arrays to `N` and `Q`, respectively.

5. Optimize the search loop: The program uses two nested loops to search for the east and west positions. However, we can optimize this search by using two separate variables to keep track of the east and west positions. We can initialize these variables with the initial positions of the people, and then update them based on the values of `A` and `D`.

6. Avoid unnecessary calculations: The program calculates `abs(t - A[people[i]])` and `abs(A[people[i]] - t)` multiple times. We can avoid these calculations by storing the absolute differences in separate variables.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using ll = long long;

int main() {
  int N, Q;
  ll T;
  std::cin >> N >> T >> Q;
  
  ll A[N];
  int D[N];
  for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
    std::cin >> A[i] >> D[i];
  }
  
  int people[Q];
  for (int i = 0; i < Q; i++) {
    std::cin >> people[i];
    people[i]--;
  }
  
  ll east, west, t, diff1, diff2;
  for (int i = 0; i < Q; i++) {
    if (D[people[i]] == 1) {
      east = A[people[i]];
      for (int j = people[i] + 1; j < N; j++) {
        if (D[j] == 1) {
          east = A[j];
        } else {
          t = (east + A[j]) / 2;
          break;
        }
      }
      diff1 = t - A[people[i]];
      if (T < diff1) {
        std::cout << A[people[i]] + T << std::endl;
      } else {
        std::cout << t << std::endl;
      }
    } else {
      west = A[people[i]];
      for (int j = people[i] - 1; j >= 0; j--) {
        if (D[j] == 1) {
          t = (west + A[j]) / 2;
          break;
        } else {
          west = A[j];
        }
      }
      diff2 = A[people[i]] - t;
      if (T < diff2) {
        std::cout << A[people[i]] - T << std::endl;
      } else {
        std::cout << t << std::endl;
      }
    }
  }
  
  return 0;
}
```
