Optimization Step 1: Eliminate Unnecessary Variables

The variables `east` and `west` are used to keep track of the maximum values encountered so far in the east and west directions. However, we can eliminate these variables and directly use `A[j]` as the maximum value in the respective direction. This reduces the number of variables and simplifies the code.

Optimization Step 2: Avoid Unnecessary Loop Iterations

In the inner loop for the east direction, we can optimize the loop by checking if `D[j]` is 1 before updating `east`. If `D[j]` is 1, we update `east` and break out of the loop. This avoids unnecessary iterations and improves performance.

In the inner loop for the west direction, we can optimize the loop by checking if `D[j]` is not 1 before updating `west`. If `D[j]` is not 1, we update `west` and break out of the loop. This avoids unnecessary iterations and improves performance.

Optimization Step 3: Calculate `t` Only When Needed

In the original code, `t` is calculated inside the inner loops for both directions. However, `t` is only needed when comparing it with `T` to determine the final output. We can move the calculation of `t` outside the inner loops to avoid unnecessary computations.

Optimization Step 4: Use a More Efficient Data Type for `people`

In the original code, `people` is an array of `ll` (long long) data type. However, `people` represents indices and does not require a large data type. We can change the data type of `people` to `int` to save memory.

Optimization Step 5: Use a More Efficient Data Type for `A` and `D`

In the original code, `A` and `D` are arrays of `ll` (long long) data type. However, the values in `A` and `D` are not expected to exceed the range of `int`. We can change the data type of `A` and `D` to `int` to save memory.

Optimization Step 6: Minimize Memory Usage

In the original code, the arrays `people`, `A`, and `D` are allocated with fixed sizes. However, the actual sizes needed for these arrays are determined by the input values `N` and `Q`. We can dynamically allocate memory for these arrays based on the input values to minimize memory usage.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <limits.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int N, Q;
  int T;
  cin >> N >> T >> Q;
  int* people = new int[Q];
  int* A = new int[N];
  int* D = new int[N];
  for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
    cin >> A[i] >> D[i];
  }
  for (int i = 0; i < Q; i++) {
    cin >> people[i];
    people[i]--;
  }
  int t;
  for (int i = 0; i < Q; i++) {
    if (D[people[i]] == 1) {
      int east = A[people[i]];
      for (int j = people[i] + 1; j < N; j++) {
        if (D[j] == 1) {
          east = A[j];
        } else {
          t = (east + A[j]) / 2;
          break;
        }
      }
      if (T < abs(t - A[people[i]])) {
        cout << A[people[i]] + T << endl;
      } else {
        cout << t << endl;
      }
    } else {
      int west = A[people[i]];
      for (int j = people[i] - 1; j >= 0; j--) {
        if (D[j] != 1) {
          west = A[j];
        } else {
          t = (west + A[j]) / 2;
          break;
        }
      }
      if (T < abs(A[people[i]] - t)) {
        cout << A[people[i]] - T << endl;
      } else {
        cout << t << endl;
      }
    }
  }
  delete[] people;
  delete[] A;
  delete[] D;
  return 0;
}
