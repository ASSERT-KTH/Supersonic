To optimize the given C++ program, we can make the following improvements:

1. Remove unnecessary headers: The program includes `<iostream>` and `<limits.h>` headers, but they are not used. We can remove these headers to reduce unnecessary overhead.

2. Remove unnecessary variable: The variable `MIN` is initialized with the value of `-(LONG_LONG_MAX - 1)`, which is `-9223372036854775807`. However, this variable is not used in the program. We can remove this variable to improve memory usage.

3. Avoid unnecessary array sizes: The arrays `people`, `A`, and `D` are declared with fixed sizes of 1001, 100001, and 100001 respectively. However, the program reads the sizes of these arrays from user input. We can remove the fixed sizes and use dynamic memory allocation to reduce memory usage.

4. Optimize the loop for finding "east" and "west" values: The loops for finding the "east" and "west" values can be optimized to break early when the required conditions are met. Currently, the loops iterate through all the elements from the given index to either the end or the beginning of the array. We can modify the loops to break as soon as the required condition is met.

5. Avoid unnecessary calculations: The program calculates the absolute difference between `T` and `t` multiple times. Instead, we can calculate this difference once and store it in a variable to avoid redundant calculations.

Here is the optimized C++ program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
using ll = long long;

int main() {
  int N, Q;
  ll T;
  cin >> N >> T >> Q;

  ll *people = new ll[Q];
  ll *A = new ll[N];
  int *D = new int[N];

  for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
    cin >> A[i] >> D[i];
  }

  for (int i = 0; i < Q; i++) {
    cin >> people[i];
    people[i]--;
  }

  ll t;
  for (int i = 0; i < Q; i++) {
    if (D[people[i]] == 1) {
      ll east = A[people[i]];
      for (ll j = people[i] + 1; j < N; j++) {
        if (D[j] == 1) {
          east = A[j];
        } else {
          t = (east + A[j]) / 2;
          break;
        }
      }
      ll diff = abs(t - A[people[i]]);
      if (T < diff) {
        cout << A[people[i]] + T << endl;
      } else {
        cout << t << endl;
      }
    } else {
      ll west = A[people[i]];
      for (ll j = people[i] - 1; j >= 0; j--) {
        if (D[j] == 1) {
          t = (west + A[j]) / 2;
          break;
        } else {
          west = A[j];
        }
      }
      ll diff = abs(A[people[i]] - t);
      if (T < diff) {
        cout << A[people[i]] - T << endl;
      } else {
        cout << t << endl;
      }
    }
  }

  delete[] people;
  delete[] A;
  delete[] D;

  return 0;
}
```

This optimized program removes unnecessary headers, variables, and unnecessary calculations to improve both running time and memory usage.
