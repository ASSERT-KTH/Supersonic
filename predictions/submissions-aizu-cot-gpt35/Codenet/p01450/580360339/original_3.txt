To optimize the given program, we can make the following changes:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The program includes `<algorithm>` and `<cstring>` which are not used. We can remove these includes to improve compile time.

2. Remove unnecessary namespace: The program uses the `using namespace std;` directive, which is generally considered bad practice as it pollutes the global namespace. We can remove this directive and explicitly specify `std::` before standard library functions and types.

3. Optimize memory usage: The program uses a 3D array `dp[2][10001][202]` to store dynamic programming values. However, we can observe that the third dimension is always equal to `N`, so we can remove it and use a 2D array instead, reducing memory usage.

4. Optimize loop conditions: The program has a loop with condition `for (int k = 0; k <= N; k++)`, but inside the loop, there is a check `if (k == N || w[k] > w[i])` which effectively ignores the last iteration. We can change the loop condition to `for (int k = 0; k < N; k++)` to avoid unnecessary iterations.

5. Optimize loop variables: The program uses the loop variables `cur` and `nxt` to index the `dp` array. However, we can observe that these variables are only used to access the `dp` array with indices `cur` and `nxt`, so we can directly use the loop variables `i%2` and `(i+1)%2` instead.

Here is the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

typedef long long ll;
const int mod = 1000000007;
int N, W;
int w[201];
ll dp[2][10001];

int main() {
  std::cin >> N >> W;
  for (int i = 0; i < N; i++)
    std::cin >> w[i];

  for (int j = 0; j <= W; j++) {
    for (int k = 0; k < N; k++) {
      if (j <= W && (k == N - 1 || w[k] + j > W))
        dp[N % 2][j] = 1;
      else
        dp[N % 2][j] = 0;
    }
  }

  for (int i = N - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
    for (int j = 0; j <= W; j++) {
      for (int k = 0; k < N; k++) {
        dp[i % 2][j] = 0;
        int nmwidx = k;
        if (k == N - 1 || w[k] > w[i])
          nmwidx = i;
        dp[i % 2][j] += dp[(i + 1) % 2][nmwidx];
        if (j + w[i] <= W)
          dp[i % 2][j] += dp[(i + 1) % 2][k];
        dp[i % 2][j] %= mod;
      }
    }
  }

  std::cout << dp[0][0] << std::endl;
  return 0;
}
```

Explanation of optimization steps:

1. I removed the unnecessary includes `<algorithm>` and `<cstring>`.

2. I removed the `using namespace std;` directive.

3. I changed the `dp` array declaration to `ll dp[2][10001]` to reduce memory usage.

4. I changed the loop condition `for (int k = 0; k <= N; k++)` to `for (int k = 0; k < N; k++)` to avoid unnecessary iterations.

5. I replaced the loop variables `cur` and `nxt` with `(i%2)` and `(i+1)%2` respectively to directly access the `dp` array.
