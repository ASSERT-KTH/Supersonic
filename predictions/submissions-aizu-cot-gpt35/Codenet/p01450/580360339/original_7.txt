The given program calculates the number of ways to choose a subset of weights such that the total weight does not exceed a given limit W. The weights are stored in the array w[].

To optimize the program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary headers: The program includes the <algorithm> and <cstring> headers, but they are not used. We can remove these headers.

2. Use a more descriptive variable name: The variable "N" represents the number of weights, and "W" represents the weight limit. We can rename these variables to "numWeights" and "weightLimit" respectively for better readability.

3. Use a more descriptive variable name for the weight array: The array "w" represents the weights. We can rename it to "weights" for better readability.

4. Use a constant variable for the maximum number of weights: The array "dp" has a fixed size of [2][10001][202]. Instead of hardcoding the values, we can use constant variables to represent them. Let's define constants "MAX_NUM_WEIGHTS" and "MAX_TOTAL_WEIGHT" for better readability.

5. Optimize the nested loops: The nested loops in the program can be optimized by reducing the number of iterations. Currently, the outer loop iterates from N-1 to 0, and the inner loops iterate from 0 to 10000 and 0 to N. We can reverse the order of the outer loop and inner loops, and change the iteration range of the inner loops to be based on the weight limit W instead of a fixed value.

6. Use a single variable for the current and next indices: The program uses two variables "cur" and "nxt" to represent the current and next indices of the dp array. We can use a single variable "idx" to represent both the current and next indices. By doing this, we can avoid unnecessary variable assignments.

7. Remove unnecessary condition checks: In the innermost loop, there are condition checks to determine the next weight index "nmwidx". We can remove these condition checks by using a separate variable "nmwidx" to store the next weight index based on the current weight index "k".

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
typedef long long ll;
const int mod = 1000000007;
const int MAX_NUM_WEIGHTS = 201;
const int MAX_TOTAL_WEIGHT = 10001;

int main() {
  int numWeights, weightLimit;
  cin >> numWeights >> weightLimit;

  int weights[MAX_NUM_WEIGHTS];
  for (int i = 0; i < numWeights; i++)
    cin >> weights[i];

  ll dp[2][MAX_TOTAL_WEIGHT][MAX_NUM_WEIGHTS];
  memset(dp, 0, sizeof(dp));

  for (int j = 0; j <= weightLimit; j++) {
    for (int k = numWeights; k >= 0; k--) {
      if (j <= weightLimit && (k == numWeights || weights[k] + j > weightLimit))
        dp[numWeights % 2][j][k] = 1;
      else
        dp[numWeights % 2][j][k] = 0;
    }
  }

  for (int i = numWeights - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
    int idx = (i + 1) % 2;
    for (int j = 0; j <= weightLimit; j++) {
      for (int k = numWeights; k >= 0; k--) {
        dp[idx][j][k] = 0;
        int nmwidx = k;
        if (k == numWeights || weights[k] > weights[i])
          nmwidx = i;
        dp[idx][j][k] += dp[(idx + 1) % 2][j][nmwidx];
        if (j + weights[i] <= weightLimit)
          dp[idx][j][k] += dp[(idx + 1) % 2][j + weights[i]][k];
        dp[idx][j][k] %= mod;
      }
    }
  }

  cout << dp[0][0][numWeights] << endl;
  return 0;
}
```
