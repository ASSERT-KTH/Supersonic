The given program is a dynamic programming solution to a problem involving a knapsack-like scenario. The program uses a 3D array `dp` to store and calculate the number of ways to fill a knapsack of weight `W` with `N` items, where each item has a weight `w[i]`. The goal is to find the number of ways to fill the knapsack exactly.

To optimize this program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The program includes the `<algorithm>` and `<cstring>` libraries, but these libraries are not used in the program. We can remove these includes to improve compilation time and reduce memory usage.

2. Remove unnecessary typedef: The program typedefs `long long` to `ll`, but the `ll` type is not used in the program. We can remove this typedef to simplify the code.

3. Optimize the outer loop: The outer loop iterates from `N-1` to `0`, but the loop variable `i` is only used to calculate the `cur` and `nxt` indices. We can change the loop to iterate from `N` to `1` and update the `cur` and `nxt` indices accordingly, which simplifies the code.

4. Optimize the inner loops: The inner loops iterate from `0` to `10001` and `0` to `N`, which is not efficient. We can optimize these loops by using the actual values of `W` and `N` instead of fixed numbers. This will reduce unnecessary iterations and improve the running time.

5. Modify the array indexing: The array `dp` is currently indexed as `dp[x][y][z]`, where `x` and `y` are fixed and `z` varies from `0` to `N`. We can modify the indexing to `dp[z][x][y]`, where `z` varies from `0` to `N`, `x` varies from `0` to `W`, and `y` varies from `0` to `N`. This change will improve cache efficiency and potentially reduce memory usage.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

const int mod = 1000000007;

int N, W;
int w[201];
int dp[202][10001][202];

int main() {
  cin >> N >> W;
  
  for (int i = 0; i < N; i++)
    cin >> w[i];
  
  for (int j = 0; j <= W; j++) {
    for (int k = 0; k <= N; k++) {
      if (j <= W && (k == N || w[k] + j > W))
        dp[k][j][k] = 1;
      else
        dp[k][j][k] = 0;
    }
  }
  
  for (int i = N; i >= 1; i--) {
    int cur = i % 2;
    int nxt = (i + 1) % 2;
    
    for (int j = 0; j <= W; j++) {
      for (int k = 0; k <= N; k++) {
        dp[k][j][nxt] = 0;
        int nmwidx = k;
        if (k == N || w[k] > w[i - 1])
          nmwidx = i - 1;
        dp[k][j][nxt] += dp[nmwidx][j][cur];
        if (j + w[i - 1] <= W)
          dp[k][j][nxt] += dp[k][j + w[i - 1]][cur];
        dp[k][j][nxt] %= mod;
      }
    }
  }
  
  cout << dp[N][0][0] << endl;
  return 0;
}
```

These modifications should optimize the program for running time and memory usage.
