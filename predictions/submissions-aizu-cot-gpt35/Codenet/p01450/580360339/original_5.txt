The given program calculates the number of ways to select a subset of items from a given set, such that the sum of the weights of the selected items is less than or equal to a given limit.

To optimize the program, I would suggest the following steps:

1. Remove the unnecessary header files `<algorithm>` and `<cstring>`. These are not used in the program.

2. Avoid using `using namespace std;` as it can lead to namespace conflicts. Instead, use the `std::` prefix for standard library functions and types.

3. Replace the `typedef long long ll;` with `using ll = long long;` for better readability.

4. Change the datatype of `dp` array from `ll` to `int`. Since the result is taken modulo `mod`, storing the values as `int` will be sufficient.

5. Modify the outer loop in the second nested loop to iterate from `W` down to `0` instead of `0` to `10000`. This will reduce unnecessary iterations when the sum of weights is larger than the given limit `W`.

6. Modify the inner loop in the second nested loop to iterate from `0` to `N-1` instead of `0` to `N`. Since the value of `k` is used as an index, it should not go up to `N`.

7. Remove the `if (j <= W && (k == N || w[k] + j > W))` condition and directly set `dp[N % 2][j][k]` to `1` if `j <= W` and `k == N`, and `0` otherwise. This will simplify the logic.

8. Remove the `int cur = (i + 1) % 2;` and `int nxt = (i) % 2;` variables and directly use `(i + 1) % 2` and `(i) % 2` in the loop.

9. Remove the unnecessary assignment `dp[nxt][j][k] = 0;` inside the second nested loop. The value is already initialized to `0` at the beginning of each iteration.

10. Use the modulo operator `%=` for updating the `dp[nxt][j][k]` values instead of separate assignment and modulo operations.

11. Instead of using `dp[0][0][N]` as the output, use `dp[0][0][N-1]` as the final result. This is because `N-1` is the index of the last item in the `w` array.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

const int mod = 1000000007;
const int MAX_N = 201;
const int MAX_W = 10001;

int N, W;
int w[MAX_N];
int dp[2][MAX_W][MAX_N];

int main() {
    std::cin >> N >> W;
    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
        std::cin >> w[i];
    }

    for (int j = 0; j <= W; j++) {
        dp[N % 2][j][N - 1] = (j >= w[N - 1]) ? 1 : 0;
    }

    for (int i = N - 2; i >= 0; i--) {
        for (int j = W; j >= 0; j--) {
            for (int k = 0; k < N - 1; k++) {
                dp[i % 2][j][k] = dp[(i + 1) % 2][j][k];
                if (j + w[i] <= W) {
                    dp[i % 2][j][k] += dp[(i + 1) % 2][j + w[i]][i];
                    dp[i % 2][j][k] %= mod;
                }
            }
        }
    }

    std::cout << dp[0][0][N - 1] << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

By implementing these optimizations, the program's running time and memory usage should be improved.
