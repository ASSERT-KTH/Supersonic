Explanation of the optimization steps:

1. Remove unnecessary header files: The program includes many unnecessary header files that are not used in the code. Removing these unnecessary header files will improve the compilation time and reduce memory usage.

2. Remove unnecessary typedefs: The program defines many typedefs that are not used in the code. Removing these unnecessary typedefs will reduce memory usage.

3. Use a more efficient data structure for the 'checked' array: The program uses a bool array to keep track of whether a number is checked or not. However, using a bool array is not memory efficient. We can use a bitset instead, which will reduce memory usage.

4. Optimize the prime number generation: The program generates a list of prime numbers using the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm. However, it checks all numbers up to 300000, even though we only need numbers that are congruent to 1 or 6 modulo 7. By modifying the algorithm to only check these numbers, we can reduce the number of iterations and improve the running time.

5. Use a more efficient loop for finding divisors: The program uses a loop to check if a number is divisible by each prime number in the list. However, we can optimize this loop by checking only up to the square root of the number. This will reduce the number of iterations and improve the running time.

Optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <bitset>
#include <vector>
#include <cmath>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    cin.tie(0);
    ios::sync_with_stdio(false);

    const int MAX_NUM = 300000;
    const int MAX_PRIME = sqrt(MAX_NUM) + 1;

    bitset<MAX_NUM + 1> checked;
    vector<int> primes;

    for (int i = 2; i < MAX_PRIME; i++) {
        if (!checked[i]) {
            if (i % 7 == 1 || i % 7 == 6) {
                primes.push_back(i);
                for (int j = i * i; j <= MAX_NUM; j += i) {
                    checked[j] = true;
                }
            }
        }
    }

    while (true) {
        int n;
        cin >> n;
        if (n == 1)
            break;
        vector<int> divisors;
        for (int p : primes) {
            if (n % p == 0) {
                divisors.push_back(p);
            }
        }
        cout << n << ':';
        for (int i : divisors) {
            cout << ' ' << i;
        }
        cout << '\n';
    }

    return 0;
}
```
