The given program calculates the dot product of each row of a matrix `a` with a vector `b` and prints the result. The program takes two inputs: the number of rows `n` and the number of columns `m` of the matrix `a`. It then takes `n` rows of `m` integers as input for the matrix `a` and finally takes `m` integers as input for the vector `b`. The dot product for each row is calculated using two nested loops.

To optimize the program for running time and memory usage, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove the unnecessary variable `x` and directly assign the input value to `a[i][j]`.
2. Remove the unnecessary variable `y` and directly assign the input value to `b[j]`.
3. Initialize `c` to 0 within the outer loop instead of outside the loop.
4. Avoid unnecessary output of `c` within the inner loop and instead accumulate the sum in a temporary variable.
5. Print the accumulated sum after the inner loop for each row.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int n, m;
  int a[100][100], b[100];
  cin >> n >> m;
  
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j < m; j++) {
      cin >> a[i][j];
    }
  }
  
  for (int j = 0; j < m; j++) {
    cin >> b[j];
  }
  
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    int c = 0;
    for (int j = 0; j < m; j++) {
      c += a[i][j] * b[j];
    }
    cout << c << endl;
  }
  
  return 0;
}
```

These modifications eliminate unnecessary variables and reduce the number of operations within the loops, resulting in improved performance and reduced memory usage.
