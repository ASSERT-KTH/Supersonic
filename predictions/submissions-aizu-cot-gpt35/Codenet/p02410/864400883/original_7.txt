The given program reads two integers n and m, followed by an n x m matrix a and an m-dimensional array b. It then performs matrix multiplication between a and b and prints the resulting n-dimensional array c.

To optimize the program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Instead of using a 2D array a, we can use a 1D array a of size n * m to store the matrix elements. This will eliminate the need for nested loops for inputting the matrix a.

2. We can calculate the dot product of each row of matrix a with array b while reading the input itself. This will eliminate the need for the third set of nested loops.

3. We can avoid printing each value of c in a separate iteration and instead store the values in an array and print them all at once after the calculation is complete.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int n, m;
  int x, y, a[10000], b[100], c[100];
  int index = 0;
  
  cin >> n >> m;
  
  // Read matrix a and calculate dot product
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    int rowSum = 0;
    for (int j = 0; j < m; j++) {
      cin >> x;
      a[index++] = x;
      rowSum += x * b[j];
    }
    c[i] = rowSum;
  }
  
  // Read array b
  for (int j = 0; j < m; j++) {
    cin >> y;
    b[j] = y;
  }
  
  // Print the resulting array c
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cout << c[i] << endl;
  }
  
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized program eliminates unnecessary nested loops and reduces memory usage by using a 1D array for matrix a. It also calculates the dot product while reading the input, avoiding the need for an additional set of nested loops. Finally, it prints the resulting array c in a single iteration.
