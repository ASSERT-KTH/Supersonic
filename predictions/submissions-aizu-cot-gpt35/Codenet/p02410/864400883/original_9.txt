Step 1: Remove unnecessary variables.

In the given program, there are some unnecessary variables like `x` and `y`. These variables are used to store temporary values while reading inputs. We can directly assign the input values to the arrays `a` and `b` without using these variables.

Step 2: Optimize the nested loops.

Currently, the program uses two nested loops to calculate the product of `a[i][j]` and `b[j]`. We can optimize this by using a single loop and multiplying the corresponding elements of `a` and `b` directly.

Step 3: Remove unnecessary output statements.

In the original program, the intermediate results of `c` are printed inside the nested loops. We can remove these output statements as they are not required.

Here is the optimized C++ program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int n, m;
  int a[100][100], b[100];

  cin >> n >> m;

  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j < m; j++) {
      cin >> a[i][j];
    }
  }

  for (int j = 0; j < m; j++) {
    cin >> b[j];
  }

  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    int c = 0;
    for (int j = 0; j < m; j++) {
      c += a[i][j] * b[j];
    }
    cout << c << endl;
  }

  return 0;
}
```

This optimized program removes unnecessary variables and output statements, resulting in improved running time and memory usage.
