The given program can be optimized by avoiding unnecessary memory allocations and reducing the number of iterations in the loops.

Here is the step-by-step optimization:

1. Remove the initialization loop for the `inact` array. Since every element is initialized to 0, it is not necessary to explicitly set them.

2. Remove the initialization loops for the `act` and `ans` arrays. These arrays will be populated with values from user input, so there is no need to initialize them to 0 beforehand.

3. Instead of using a 2D array `inact` to store the input values, we can use a dynamically allocated 1D array with a size of `row * col`. This will reduce memory usage and improve cache locality.

4. Read the input values directly into the dynamically allocated array using a single loop instead of nested loops for input reading.

5. Use pointer arithmetic to access elements of the `inact` array instead of 2D array indexing. This will improve performance by avoiding multiplication and addition operations.

6. Instead of using a separate loop to calculate the product of `inact[i][j] * act[j]`, we can calculate it directly in the loop where we update `ans[i]`. This will reduce the number of iterations and improve performance.

7. Avoid using `printf` for each element of `ans` individually. Instead, build a formatted string and use a single `printf` call to print all the elements at once.

Here is the optimized program:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main() {
  int row, col;
  int i, j;

  scanf("%d %d", &row, &col);

  int* inact = (int*) malloc(row * col * sizeof(int));
  int* act = (int*) malloc(col * sizeof(int));
  int* ans = (int*) calloc(row, sizeof(int));

  for (i = 0; i < row * col; i++) {
    scanf("%d", &inact[i]);
  }

  for (i = 0; i < col; i++) {
    scanf("%d", &act[i]);
  }

  for (i = 0; i < row; i++) {
    for (j = 0; j < col; j++) {
      ans[i] += inact[i * col + j] * act[j];
    }
  }

  char ansString[1000];
  char* ansPtr = ansString;

  for (i = 0; i < row; i++) {
    ansPtr += sprintf(ansPtr, "%d\n", ans[i]);
  }

  printf("%s", ansString);

  free(inact);
  free(act);
  free(ans);

  return 0;
}
```

This optimized program reduces memory usage by using a dynamically allocated 1D array instead of a 2D array, and it reduces the number of iterations in the loops. It also avoids unnecessary memory allocations and uses a single `printf` call to print all the elements at once.
