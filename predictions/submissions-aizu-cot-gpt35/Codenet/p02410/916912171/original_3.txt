This program calculates the dot product of a matrix and a vector.

To optimize this program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Instead of initializing the `inact` array with zeros using a nested loop, we can use the `memset` function from the `<string.h>` library to set all the elements to zero.

2. Instead of using separate arrays for `act` and `ans`, we can combine them into a single array called `result`. This way, we can avoid unnecessary memory accesses and improve cache locality.

3. We can remove the unnecessary initialization of `act` to zero, as we will be overwriting its values with user input.

4. We can remove the unnecessary initialization of `ans` to zero, as each element will be calculated and assigned in the subsequent loop.

5. We can use the `register` keyword to suggest the compiler to store frequently accessed variables in registers, improving performance.

Here is the optimized program:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int main() {
  int inact[100][100];
  int result[100];
  int row, col;
  int i, j;

  memset(inact, 0, sizeof(inact));
  scanf("%d %d", &row, &col);

  for (i = 0; i < row; i++) {
    for (j = 0; j < col; j++) {
      scanf("%d", &inact[i][j]);
    }
  }

  for (i = 0; i < col; i++) {
    scanf("%d", &result[i]);
  }

  for (i = 0; i < row; i++) {
    register int sum = 0;
    for (j = 0; j < col; j++) {
      sum += inact[i][j] * result[j];
    }
    printf("%d\n", sum);
  }

  return 0;
}
```

These optimizations should help improve the running time and memory usage of the program.
