To optimize the given C/C++ program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Instead of initializing the arrays `inact`, `act`, and `ans` with zeroes using a nested loop, we can use the `memset` function from the `string.h` library to set all elements to zero in a single line.

2. We can reduce memory usage by using variable-length arrays instead of fixed-size arrays. We can obtain the values of `row` and `col` from the user at runtime and then dynamically allocate memory for the arrays `inact`, `act`, and `ans`.

3. We can reduce the number of iterations in the nested loops by swapping the order of the loops. This way, we iterate over the columns first and then over the rows, which can improve cache locality and potentially result in faster memory access.

Here is the optimized version of the program:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int main() {
  int row, col;
  scanf("%d %d", &row, &col);

  int inact[row][col];
  int act[col];
  int ans[row];

  memset(inact, 0, sizeof(inact));
  memset(act, 0, sizeof(act));
  memset(ans, 0, sizeof(ans));

  for (int i = 0; i < row; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j < col; j++) {
      scanf("%d", &inact[i][j]);
    }
  }

  for (int i = 0; i < col; i++) {
    scanf("%d", &act[i]);
  }

  for (int i = 0; i < col; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j < row; j++) {
      ans[j] += inact[j][i] * act[i];
    }
  }

  for (int i = 0; i < row; i++) {
    printf("%d\n", ans[i]);
  }

  return 0;
}
```

Explanation of optimizations:
1. By using `memset`, we can initialize the arrays `inact`, `act`, and `ans` with zeroes in a single line, which is more efficient than using nested loops.
2. By using variable-length arrays, we can reduce memory usage and make the program more flexible. The size of the arrays `inact`, `act`, and `ans` is determined at runtime based on the user input.
3. By swapping the order of the nested loops, we iterate over the columns first and then over the rows. This can improve cache locality and potentially result in faster memory access.
