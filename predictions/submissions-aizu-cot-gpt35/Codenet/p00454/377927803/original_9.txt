This program is a flood fill algorithm that counts the number of connected components in a grid.

To optimize the program, I would suggest the following steps:

1. Remove unnecessary header files: The program includes a lot of unnecessary header files that are not used. We can remove them to improve compilation time.

2. Use a more efficient data structure for the grid: The program currently uses a 2D array to represent the grid. This can be memory-intensive, especially for large grids. Instead, we can use a 1D array and compute the index using the formula `index = y * w + x`. This will reduce the memory usage and improve cache performance.

3. Use a boolean array instead of a 2D array: The program currently uses a 2D array of bools to represent the grid. We can use a 1D array of bools instead, where each element represents a cell in the grid. This will further reduce memory usage.

4. Use a more efficient method to compress the coordinates: The current method of compressing the coordinates involves sorting and searching. We can improve this by using a set data structure instead. We can insert all the coordinates into the set and then assign compressed indices to each coordinate based on their order in the set.

5. Use a more efficient method to count the connected components: The current method of counting the connected components uses a nested loop and a flood fill algorithm. We can improve this by using a disjoint set data structure. We can initialize each cell as a separate set and then merge the sets of adjacent cells. Finally, we can count the number of distinct sets to determine the number of connected components.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <set>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int w, h;
int n;
int x1[1005], x2[1005];
int y1[1005], y2[1005];
vector<int> dsu;
vector<bool> fld;
int dx[4] = {-1, 0, 1, 0};
int dy[4] = {0, -1, 0, 1};

int find(int x) {
    if (dsu[x] == x) {
        return x;
    }
    return dsu[x] = find(dsu[x]);
}

void merge(int x, int y) {
    x = find(x);
    y = find(y);
    if (x != y) {
        dsu[x] = y;
    }
}

int compress(int *x1, int *x2, int w) {
    set<int> xs;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        for (int d = -1; d <= 1; ++d) {
            int tx1 = x1[i] + d, tx2 = x2[i] + d;
            if (0 <= tx1 && tx1 <= w)
                xs.insert(tx1);
            if (0 <= tx2 && tx2 <= w)
                xs.insert(tx2);
        }
    }
    int compressed_w = xs.size();
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        x1[i] = distance(xs.begin(), xs.find(x1[i]));
        x2[i] = distance(xs.begin(), xs.find(x2[i]));
    }
    return compressed_w;
}

int main() {
    ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(0);
    while (cin >> w >> h, w) {
        cin >> n;
        dsu.resize(w * h);
        fld.assign(w * h, false);
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            cin >> x1[i] >> y1[i] >> x2[i] >> y2[i];
        }
        w = compress(x1, x2, w);
        h = compress(y1, y2, h);
        for (int i = 0; i < w * h; ++i) {
            dsu[i] = i;
        }
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            for (int y = y1[i]; y <= y2[i] - 1; ++y) {
                for (int x = x1[i]; x <= x2[i] - 1; ++x) {
                    fld[y * w + x] = true;
                }
            }
        }
        int ans = 0;
        for (int y = 0; y < h - 1; ++y) {
            for (int x = 0; x < w - 1; ++x) {
                if (fld[y * w + x])
                    continue;
                ans++;
                for (int i = 0; i < 4; ++i) {
                    int ny = y + dy[i], nx = x + dx[i];
                    if (ny < 0 || ny >= h - 1 || nx < 0 || nx >= w - 1 || fld[ny * w + nx])
                        continue;
                    merge(y * w + x, ny * w + nx);
                }
            }
        }
        set<int> distinct_sets;
        for (int i = 0; i < w * h; ++i) {
            if (!fld[i]) {
                distinct_sets.insert(find(i));
            }
        }
        ans += distinct_sets.size();
        cout << ans << endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
```

The optimized program uses a more efficient data structure for the grid, compresses the coordinates using a set, and counts the connected components using a disjoint set data structure. These optimizations improve both the running time and memory usage of the program.
