Step 1: Remove unnecessary variables and arrays

In the given program, the variables `t` and `C` are not used. Additionally, the arrays `S` and `T` have fixed sizes of 100, which may be unnecessary and waste memory if the actual input sizes are smaller. Therefore, we can remove these variables and arrays to optimize memory usage.

Step 2: Optimize the nested loops

The current implementation uses nested loops to compare each element of `S` with each element of `T`. This results in a time complexity of O(n*q), where n is the size of `S` and q is the size of `T`. We can optimize this by using a more efficient algorithm.

One approach is to use a set or a hash table to store the elements of `S`. This will allow us to check if an element of `T` exists in `S` in constant time. By doing this, we can reduce the time complexity to O(n+q).
