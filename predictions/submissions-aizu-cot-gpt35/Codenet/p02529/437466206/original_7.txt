The given program is a simple program that counts the number of elements in array `T` that are also present in array `S`. 

To optimize the program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Instead of using separate arrays `S` and `T`, we can use a single array `S` to store both `S` and `T` elements. This will reduce memory usage.

2. We can use a hash set to store the elements of array `S`. This will allow us to perform constant time lookups to check if an element is present in `S`, instead of using a nested loop. This will improve the running time of the program.

Here is the optimized program:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

#define MAX_N 100

int main() {
  int i, n, q, t, C = 0, S[MAX_N], element;

  scanf("%d", &n);

  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    scanf("%d", &element);
    S[element] = 1;
  }

  scanf("%d", &q);

  for (i = 0; i < q; i++) {
    scanf("%d", &element);
    if (S[element] == 1) {
      C++;
    }
  }

  printf("%d\n", C);

  return 0;
}
```

Explanation of optimization steps:

1. We removed the array `T` and merged its elements into array `S`. This eliminates the need for a separate array and reduces memory usage.

2. We defined a constant `MAX_N` to represent the maximum number of elements in array `S`. This allows us to statically allocate the array size.

3. Instead of using a nested loop to compare each element of `S` with each element of `T`, we use a hash set approach. We initialize all elements of `S` to 0. When reading elements from `S`, we set the corresponding element in the array to 1. When reading elements from `T`, we check if the corresponding element in `S` is 1. If it is, we increment the counter `C`. This eliminates the need for nested loops and improves the running time of the program.
