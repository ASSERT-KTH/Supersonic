To optimize the given program, we can use a data structure called a hash set to store the elements of array S. This will allow us to quickly check if an element exists in S or not. By doing so, we can reduce the time complexity of the inner loop from O(q) to O(1), resulting in overall improved performance.

Here are the step-by-step optimizations:

1. Include the `<unordered_set>` header file to use the hash set data structure.
2. Replace the array S with an unordered_set called `S_set`.
3. Instead of reading elements into array S, read them directly into the `S_set`.
4. Remove the inner loop and replace it with a check to see if the element exists in `S_set`.
5. Increment the counter C only if the element is found in `S_set`.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unordered_set>

int main() {
  int i, k, n, q, t, C = 0;
  std::unordered_set<int> S_set;

  scanf("%d", &n);
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    scanf("%d", &t);
    S_set.insert(t);
  }

  scanf("%d", &q);
  for (i = 0; i < q; i++) {
    scanf("%d", &t);
    if (S_set.find(t) != S_set.end()) {
      C++;
    }
  }

  printf("%d\n", C);
  return 0;
}
```

In this optimized program, we have replaced the array `S` with an `unordered_set<int>` called `S_set`. The elements are read directly into `S_set` using the `insert()` function.

Inside the loop for array `T`, we use the `find()` function of `unordered_set` to check if the element exists in `S_set`. If it does, we increment the counter `C`.

By using a hash set, we can perform the check in constant time, resulting in an improved overall performance of the program.
