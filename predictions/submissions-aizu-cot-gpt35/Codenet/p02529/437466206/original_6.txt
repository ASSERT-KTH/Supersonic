Explanation of optimization steps:

1. Remove unnecessary variables: The variables `t` and `C` are not used in the program, so we can remove them.

2. Optimize array sizes: The arrays `S` and `T` are declared with a fixed size of 100, but we don't know if the input will have that many elements. We can use dynamic memory allocation to allocate memory for these arrays based on the input size.

3. Optimize the loop conditions: The loop condition for the inner loop should be `k < n` instead of `k < q`, as `n` represents the size of array `S`.

4. Use a more efficient algorithm: Instead of using nested loops to compare each element of `S` with each element of `T`, we can use a hash set or a binary search algorithm to improve the time complexity.

Optimized program:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main() {
  int i, n, q;
  scanf("%d", &n);
  int *S = (int *)malloc(n * sizeof(int));
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    scanf("%d", &S[i]);
  }
  scanf("%d", &q);
  int *T = (int *)malloc(q * sizeof(int));
  for (i = 0; i < q; i++) {
    scanf("%d", &T[i]);
  }
  int C = 0;
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    int found = binarySearch(T, q, S[i]);
    if (found != -1) {
      C++;
    }
  }
  printf("%d\n", C);
  free(S);
  free(T);
  return 0;
}

int binarySearch(int arr[], int size, int key) {
  int left = 0, right = size - 1;
  while (left <= right) {
    int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
    if (arr[mid] == key) {
      return mid;
    }
    if (arr[mid] < key) {
      left = mid + 1;
    } else {
      right = mid - 1;
    }
  }
  return -1;
}
```

This optimized program improves memory usage by dynamically allocating memory for arrays `S` and `T` based on the input size. It also uses a binary search algorithm to search for elements in array `T`, which has a time complexity of O(log n) instead of O(n) in the original program.
