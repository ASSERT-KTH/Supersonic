The given program can be optimized in the following steps:

1. Remove the unnecessary `#define` statement for `s`. It is not being used in the program.

2. Change the size of the array `c` to match the maximum possible value of `b`. Instead of fixed size `999`, we can use `b + 1` as the size.

3. Remove the second loop and modify the first loop to calculate the sum of the values entered by the user in `d` variable directly.

4. Remove the redundant initialization `c[b] = 1` in the first loop.

5. Remove the variable `a` and replace it with the condition `b > 0` in the modified loop.

6. Finally, remove the unused variable `a` from the program.

Here is the optimized version of the program:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int b, d, c[1000];

int main() {
  scanf("%d", &b);
  for (int i = 0; i < b; i++) {
    int input;
    scanf("%d", &input);
    d += input;
    c[input]++;
  }
  
  printf("%d\n", d);
  return 0;
}
```
