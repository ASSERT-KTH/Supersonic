The given program reads an integer `b` from the user and then reads `b` integers from the user. It counts the number of times each input integer appears and prints the total count.

To optimize this program, we can eliminate the array `c` and use a single variable `count` to store the total count. Instead of storing the count for each input integer, we can increment `count` directly in the second loop.

Here is the optimized program:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  int a, b, count = 0;
  scanf("%d", &b);
  
  for (a = b; a--; count++)
    scanf("%d", &b);
  
  for (a = b; a--; count += b == a)
    scanf("%d", &b);
  
  printf("%d\n", count);
  return 0;
}
```
