This is the original program:

1. It includes the necessary header file `stdio.h`.
2. It defines a macro `s` to simplify the usage of `scanf`.
3. It declares four variables: `a`, `b`, `d`, and `c`.
4. It defines the main function.
5. It uses a for loop to read inputs and set elements of the array `c` to 1.
6. It uses another for loop to read inputs and increment the variable `d` based on the values of `c`.

To optimize the program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove the unnecessary macro `s` and replace its usages with `scanf` directly.
2. Remove the unused variable `a` and initialize `d` to 0.
3. Use a more appropriate data type for the array `c` instead of a fixed-size array.
4. Simplify the for loops by using a single loop to read inputs and update both `c` and `d` simultaneously.

Here is the optimized program:

```
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  int b, d = 0;
  int num;
  
  scanf("%d", &b);
  
  for (int i = 0; i < b; i++) {
    scanf("%d", &num);
    d += num;
  }
  
  printf("%d\n", d);
  return 0;
}
```
