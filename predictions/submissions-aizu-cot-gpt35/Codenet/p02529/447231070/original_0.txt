The given program reads a number `b` from the input and then reads `b` more numbers. It stores the count of each number in an array `c[]`. Finally, it calculates the sum of the counts and prints it.

To optimize this program, we can eliminate the array `c[]` and directly calculate the sum while reading the numbers. This will reduce memory usage and eliminate the need for an additional loop.

Here is the optimized program:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  int a, b, d = 0;
  
  scanf("%d", &b);
  
  for (a = b; a--; ) {
    int num;
    scanf("%d", &num);
    d++;
  }
  
  printf("%d\n", d);
  
  return 0;
}
```

Explanation of the optimization:
1. Removed the unnecessary `#define` for `scanf` as it was not used.
2. Removed the array `c[]` and the second loop.
3. Added a variable `d` to keep track of the count.
4. Read the number `b` directly in the main function.
5. Inside the loop, read each number and increment `d` directly.
6. Print the final count `d`.
