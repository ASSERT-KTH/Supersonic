The given program reads a number `b` from the user, and then reads `b` more numbers from the user. It counts the number of times each number appears and prints the sum of those counts.

To optimize this program, we can use a more efficient data structure to store the counts of each number. Instead of using an array `c` of size 999, we can use a hash table or a map to store the counts.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unordered_map>

int main() {
  int b, d = 0;
  std::unordered_map<int, int> counts;
  
  scanf("%d", &b);
  for (int i = 0; i < b; i++) {
    int num;
    scanf("%d", &num);
    counts[num]++;
  }
  
  scanf("%d", &b);
  for (int i = 0; i < b; i++) {
    int num;
    scanf("%d", &num);
    d += counts[num];
  }
  
  printf("%d\n", d);
  return 0;
}
```

Explanation of optimization steps:

1. Removed the unnecessary global variables `a`, `c`, and `d`. They can be declared within the `main` function.
2. Replaced the macro `#define s scanf("%d", &b)` with direct `scanf` calls. Macros can be error-prone and harder to debug.
3. Changed the array `c` to an `std::unordered_map<int, int> counts`. This allows us to efficiently store and retrieve the counts of each number.
4. Replaced the loops that iterate `a` times with loops that iterate `b` times. The variable `a` is unnecessary and redundant.
5. Removed the decrement of `a` in the loop condition. Instead, we can use the loop counter `i` to control the loop.
6. Replaced the array access `c[b]` with `counts[num]` to retrieve the count of each number.
7. Replaced the increment of `d` with `d += counts[num]` to increment the count by the number of occurrences.
