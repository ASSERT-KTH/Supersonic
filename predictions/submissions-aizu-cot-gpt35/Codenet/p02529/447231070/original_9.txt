The given program reads integers from the user and counts the number of occurrences of each integer. It uses an array `c` to keep track of the count for each integer.

To optimize the program for running time and memory usage, we can use a dynamic data structure such as a hash table or a balanced search tree instead of the array `c`. This will allow us to handle a large range of input values without wasting memory.

Here is the optimized program that uses a hash table to store the count for each integer:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

typedef struct Node {
  int key;
  int count;
  struct Node* next;
} Node;

Node* createNode(int key) {
  Node* newNode = (Node*)malloc(sizeof(Node));
  newNode->key = key;
  newNode->count = 0;
  newNode->next = NULL;
  return newNode;
}

void insert(Node* hashtable[], int key) {
  int index = abs(key) % 999;
  if (hashtable[index] == NULL) {
    hashtable[index] = createNode(key);
  } else {
    Node* cur = hashtable[index];
    while (cur->next != NULL && cur->key != key) {
      cur = cur->next;
    }
    if (cur->key == key) {
      cur->count++;
    } else {
      cur->next = createNode(key);
    }
  }
}

int getCount(Node* hashtable[], int key) {
  int index = abs(key) % 999;
  Node* cur = hashtable[index];
  while (cur != NULL && cur->key != key) {
    cur = cur->next;
  }
  if (cur != NULL && cur->key == key) {
    return cur->count;
  }
  return 0;
}

int main() {
  int a, b, d;
  Node* hashtable[999] = {NULL};

  scanf("%d", &b);
  for (a = b; a > 0; a--) {
    int num;
    scanf("%d", &num);
    insert(hashtable, num);
  }

  d = 0;
  scanf("%d", &b);
  for (a = b; a > 0; a--) {
    int num;
    scanf("%d", &num);
    d += getCount(hashtable, num);
  }

  printf("%d\n", d);
  return 0;
}
```

Explanation of the optimization:

1. We define a new data structure `Node` to store the key and count for each integer.
2. We create a hash table `hashtable` which is an array of pointers to `Node` structures. Each entry in the hash table represents a linked list of `Node` elements with the same hash value.
3. We define functions `createNode`, `insert`, and `getCount` to handle the insertion and retrieval of elements in the hash table.
4. In the `main` function, we initialize the hash table to `NULL`.
5. We read the input value `b` and populate the hash table with the count for each integer entered by the user in the first loop.
6. We initialize `d` to 0 and read the input value `b` again. In the second loop, we retrieve the count for each integer entered by the user from the hash table and update the value of `d` accordingly.
7. Finally, we print the value of `d`.

By using a hash table, we can handle a large range of input values without wasting memory. Additionally, the retrieval of the count for each integer becomes more efficient as we only need to search the linked list corresponding to the hash value of the key.
