This program reads a number `b` from the user, then reads `b` numbers and stores them in an array `c`. It then reads `b` more numbers and adds up the corresponding values in `c` to a variable `d`, and finally prints the value of `d`.

To optimize this program, we can make the following changes:

1. Remove the unnecessary variable `a` and initialize `d` to 0.
2. Instead of using the array `c` to store the numbers, we can directly sum them as we read them.

Here is the optimized program:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int b, d = 0;

int main() {
  scanf("%d", &b);
  
  for (int i = 0; i < b; i++) {
    int num;
    scanf("%d", &num);
    d += num;
  }
  
  printf("%d\n", d);
  return 0;
}
```

Explanation of the optimization:

1. We removed the unnecessary variable `a` as it is not used in any meaningful way.
2. We removed the array `c` as it is not needed to store the numbers. Instead, we directly sum the numbers as we read them in the second `for` loop.
3. We removed the macro `s` and replaced it with the `scanf` function call directly in the code to improve readability.
4. We removed the initialization of `c[b]` to 1 in the first `for` loop as it is not needed in the optimized version.
5. We added the `int i` variable in the `for` loop to iterate over the numbers being read in the optimized version.
