To optimize the given program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove the unnecessary `float` data type for variable `f`. Since we are only comparing the value of `f` with other constants, we can use `int` instead.

2. Instead of using nested ternary operators, we can use a lookup table to store the weight categories. This will improve the readability of the code and potentially reduce the number of comparisons.

3. We can remove the `~scanf("%f", &f)` loop condition and use `scanf("%f", &f)` directly in the loop. The loop will terminate when the `scanf` function returns a non-positive value, indicating the end of input.

With these optimizations in mind, here is the optimized program:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  int f;
  char* weightCategories[] = {
    "light fly",
    "fly",
    "bantam",
    "feather",
    "light",
    "light welter",
    "welter",
    "light middle",
    "middle",
    "light heavy",
    "heavy"
  };

  while (scanf("%d", &f) > 0) {
    int index = (f - 48) / 3;
    if (index >= 0 && index < 11) {
      printf("%s\n", weightCategories[index]);
    }
  }

  return 0;
}
```

In this optimized program, we use an array `weightCategories` to store the weight category strings. The index of the array is calculated based on the input value `f` using the formula `(f - 48) / 3`. This reduces the number of comparisons and improves the readability of the code.
