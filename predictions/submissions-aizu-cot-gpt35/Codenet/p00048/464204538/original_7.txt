To optimize the given program, we can reduce the number of comparisons by using a lookup table. Here are the optimization steps:

1. Create a lookup table that maps weight thresholds to weight classes. The thresholds and classes can be stored in a 2D array or a struct array.

2. Iterate over the input weights and use the lookup table to determine the weight class.

3. Print the weight class.

By using a lookup table, we can eliminate the need for multiple comparisons in each iteration. This will improve both the running time and memory usage of the program.

Here is the optimized program:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

typedef struct {
  float threshold;
  const char* weightClass;
} WeightClass;

const WeightClass weightClasses[] = {
    {91, "heavy"},
    {81, "light heavy"},
    {75, "middle"},
    {69, "light middle"},
    {64, "welter"},
    {60, "light welter"},
    {57, "light"},
    {54, "feather"},
    {51, "bantam"},
    {48, "fly"},
    {0, "light fly"}
};

int main() {
  float f;
  while (scanf("%f", &f) == 1) {
    const char* weightClass = "unknown";
    for (int i = 0; i < sizeof(weightClasses) / sizeof(weightClasses[0]); i++) {
      if (f > weightClasses[i].threshold) {
        weightClass = weightClasses[i].weightClass;
        break;
      }
    }
    puts(weightClass);
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Explanation:

- We define a `WeightClass` struct to hold the weight threshold and weight class name.
- We create a `weightClasses` array that contains the weight thresholds and weight class names.
- We iterate over the input weights using a `while` loop and `scanf`.
- For each weight, we iterate over the `weightClasses` array and compare the weight with the threshold.
- When we find a threshold that the weight exceeds, we set the `weightClass` variable to the corresponding weight class name.
- Finally, we print the `weightClass` using `puts`.

This optimized program reduces the number of comparisons by using a lookup table, resulting in improved performance.
