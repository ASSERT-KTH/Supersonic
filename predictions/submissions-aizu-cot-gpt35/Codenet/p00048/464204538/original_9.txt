The given program reads a floating-point number from the input and prints a corresponding weight category based on the value of the number.

To optimize the program, we can reduce the number of comparisons by using a lookup table instead of a series of nested ternary operators.

Here are the optimization steps:

1. Create an array `categories` to store the weight categories.
2. Initialize `categories` with the weight category strings in the desired order.
3. Create an array `weights` to store the corresponding weight thresholds for each category.
4. Initialize `weights` with the weight thresholds in the desired order.
5. Read the input floating-point number `f`.
6. Iterate over the `weights` array from the highest value to the lowest. If `f` is greater than the current weight threshold, print the corresponding category from the `categories` array and break the loop.
7. If none of the weight thresholds are exceeded, print the default category "light fly".

Here is the optimized program:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  float f;

  // Define the weight categories
  const char* categories[] = {"heavy",
                              "light heavy",
                              "middle",
                              "light middle",
                              "welter",
                              "light welter",
                              "light",
                              "feather",
                              "bantam",
                              "fly",
                              "light fly"};

  // Define the weight thresholds
  const float weights[] = {91, 81, 75, 69, 64, 60, 57, 54, 51, 48};

  while (scanf("%f", &f) != EOF) {
    int i;
    for (i = 0; i < sizeof(weights) / sizeof(weights[0]); i++) {
      if (f > weights[i]) {
        puts(categories[i]);
        break;
      }
    }
    if (i == sizeof(weights) / sizeof(weights[0])) {
      puts(categories[i]);
    }
  }

  return 0;
}
```

By using a lookup table, the optimized program reduces the number of comparisons and improves the readability of the code. It should be more efficient in terms of both running time and memory usage.
