Step 1: Avoid unnecessary memory allocation
The program currently allocates a 102x102 matrix `C` for each test case, even though the maximum dimensions of the maze are provided as input. We can modify the program to allocate a matrix of size `W+2` x `H+2` instead, where `W` and `H` are the maximum dimensions of the maze.

Step 2: Optimize the recursive function `meiro`
Currently, the `meiro` function uses recursive calls to explore the maze. However, this can lead to many unnecessary function calls and stack operations. We can optimize this by using an iterative approach using a stack or queue data structure.

Step 3: Avoid unnecessary input/output operations
The program currently reads input and writes output for each test case separately. This can be time-consuming, especially if there are a large number of test cases. We can modify the program to read all the input first and store it in variables or data structures, and then process all the test cases in a single loop. Similarly, we can store the output in a data structure and then write it all at once.

Here's the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  while (1) {
    int w, h;
    cin >> w >> h;
    if (w == 0 && h == 0) {
      break;
    }
    
    vector<vector<int>> C(w+2, vector<int>(h+2, 10));

    int xs, ys, xg, yg;
    cin >> xs >> ys >> xg >> yg;
    
    int n;
    cin >> n;
    
    int c, d, x, y;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      cin >> c >> d >> x >> y;
      if (d == 0) {
        for (int j = x; j < x + 4; j++) {
          for (int k = y; k < y + 2; k++) {
            C[j][k] = c;
          }
        }
      } else {
        for (int j = x; j < x + 2; j++) {
          for (int k = y; k < y + 4; k++) {
            C[j][k] = c;
          }
        }
      }
    }
    
    queue<pair<int, int>> q;
    q.push({xs, ys});
    C[xs][ys] = -1;
    
    while (!q.empty()) {
      int W = q.front().first;
      int H = q.front().second;
      q.pop();
      
      if (W == xg && H == yg) {
        break;
      }
      
      if (C[W-1][H] == C[xs][ys]) {
        C[W-1][H] = -1;
        q.push({W-1, H});
      }
      if (C[W][H+1] == C[xs][ys]) {
        C[W][H+1] = -1;
        q.push({W, H+1});
      }
      if (C[W+1][H] == C[xs][ys]) {
        C[W+1][H] = -1;
        q.push({W+1, H});
      }
      if (C[W][H-1] == C[xs][ys]) {
        C[W][H-1] = -1;
        q.push({W, H-1});
      }
    }
    
    if (C[xg][yg] == -1) {
      cout << "OK" << endl;
    } else {
      cout << "NG" << endl;
    }
  }
  
  return 0;
}
```

Explanation:
1. We replace the fixed-size 102x102 matrix `C` with a dynamically allocated matrix `C` of size `w+2` x `h+2`.
2. We use a `queue` data structure to implement an iterative breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm instead of the recursive `meiro` function.
3. We store the input in variables and a 2D vector `C` before processing the test cases.
4. We use the `queue` to iterate over the cells of the maze, updating their values and queueing adjacent cells if they have the same value as the starting cell.
5. We check the final value of the target cell and output "OK" or "NG" accordingly.
