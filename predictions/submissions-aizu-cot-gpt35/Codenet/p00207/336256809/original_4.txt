The given C/C++ program performs a maze search using a recursive approach. The main optimization that can be done is to avoid unnecessary recursive calls.

Currently, the program checks if the current cell value is equal to `c` before making a recursive call. If the check fails, the program simply returns without doing anything. This leads to unnecessary recursive calls for cells that have already been visited.

To optimize the program, we can modify the `meiro` function to check if the current cell value is equal to `-1` instead of `c`. If the check passes, the program can return without making any recursive calls. This will avoid unnecessary recursive calls and improve the running time of the program.

Here's the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int C[102][102];

void meiro(int W, int H, int c) {
  if (C[W][H] == -1) {
    return;
  }
  if (C[W][H] != c) {
    return;
  }
  C[W][H] = -1;
  meiro(W - 1, H, c);
  meiro(W, H + 1, c);
  meiro(W + 1, H, c);
  meiro(W, H - 1, c);
}

int main() {
  while (1) {
    int w, h;
    cin >> w >> h;
    if (w == 0 && h == 0) {
      break;
    }
    for (int i = 0; i < 102; i++) {
      for (int j = 0; j < 102; j++) {
        C[i][j] = 10;
      }
    }
    int xs, ys, xg, yg;
    cin >> xs >> ys >> xg >> yg;
    int n;
    cin >> n;
    int c, d, x, y;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      cin >> c >> d >> x >> y;
      if (d == 0) {
        for (int j = x; j < x + 4; j++) {
          for (int k = y; k < y + 2; k++) {
            C[j][k] = c;
          }
        }
      } else {
        for (int j = x; j < x + 2; j++) {
          for (int k = y; k < y + 4; k++) {
            C[j][k] = c;
          }
        }
      }
    }
    meiro(xs, ys, C[xs][ys]);
    if (C[xg][yg] == -1) {
      cout << "OK" << endl;
    } else {
      cout << "NG" << endl;
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```

In this optimized version, the only modification is made in the `meiro` function where the check for `-1` is added before the check for `c`. This ensures that unnecessary recursive calls are avoided.
