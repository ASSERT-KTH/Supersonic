Step 1: Remove unnecessary global variables

The program currently uses global variables `Board`, `isOK`, `xs`, `ys`, `xg`, and `yg`. It would be better to pass these variables as parameters to the `DFS` function and the `main` function, to avoid using global variables.

Step 2: Optimize the board initialization

The program initializes the `Board` array with `-1` values for each iteration of the outer for loop. However, this is unnecessary because the values are immediately overwritten in the inner for loop. We can remove the outer for loop and initialize the `Board` array with `0` values instead, since `0` represents an empty cell.

Step 3: Optimize the DFS function

The `DFS` function currently performs redundant checks for out-of-bounds indices. We can optimize it by checking the boundaries before making the recursive calls. Additionally, we can modify the function to return a boolean value instead of using a global variable `isOK`, and eliminate the need for the `isOK` variable.

Step 4: Optimize the input reading

The program currently reads the dimensions of the board (`w` and `h`) in each iteration of the while loop. However, the dimensions do not change within the loop, so we can move the input reading outside the loop.

Step 5: Optimize the loop iteration for the obstacles

The program currently loops `n` times to read the obstacles. However, we can optimize it by using a single loop to read the obstacles and update the board simultaneously.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

bool DFS(int Board[102][102], int c, int x, int y, int xg, int yg) {
    if (Board[x][y] != c) {
        return false;
    } else if (x == xg && y == yg) {
        return true;
    }
    Board[x][y] = 0;

    if (x + 1 < 102 && DFS(Board, c, x + 1, y, xg, yg)) {
        return true;
    }
    if (y + 1 < 102 && DFS(Board, c, x, y + 1, xg, yg)) {
        return true;
    }
    if (x - 1 >= 0 && DFS(Board, c, x - 1, y, xg, yg)) {
        return true;
    }
    if (y - 1 >= 0 && DFS(Board, c, x, y - 1, xg, yg)) {
        return true;
    }
    return false;
}

int main() {
    int w, h;
    cin >> w >> h;
    while (w != 0 || h != 0) {
        int Board[102][102] = {};
        for (int i = 0; i < h; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < w; j++) {
                cin >> Board[j][i];
            }
        }
        int xs, ys, xg, yg;
        cin >> xs >> ys >> xg >> yg;

        int n;
        cin >> n;
        for (int t = 0; t < n; t++) {
            int c, d, x, y;
            cin >> c >> d >> x >> y;
            int wb = 2 + (!d * 2);
            int hb = 2 + (d * 2);
            for (int i = 0; i < hb; i++) {
                for (int j = 0; j < wb; j++) {
                    Board[x + j][y + i] = c;
                }
            }
        }

        if (DFS(Board, Board[xs][ys], xs, ys, xg, yg)) {
            cout << "OK" << endl;
        } else {
            cout << "NG" << endl;
        }

        cin >> w >> h;
    }
    return 0;
}
