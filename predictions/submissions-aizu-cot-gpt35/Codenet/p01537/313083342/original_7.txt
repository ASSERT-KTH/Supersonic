To optimize the given program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The program includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header, which is not standard and includes a large number of unnecessary headers. We can remove this line and include only the headers that are actually used in the program.

2. Avoid unnecessary conversions: The `mb[i] = smallest_enclosing_disc(g).rad;` line converts the `rad` value of the `C` structure returned by `smallest_enclosing_disc` to a `ld` type. Since `rad` is already of type `ld`, this conversion is unnecessary and can be removed.

3. Avoid unnecessary sorting: The `sort(all(a))` and `sort(all(b))` lines sort the vectors `a` and `b` respectively. However, the subsequent loop only checks if `a[i]` is less than `b[j]`, where `i` and `j` are incremented sequentially. Therefore, we can use two pointers to keep track of the current positions in `a` and `b` and avoid sorting the vectors.

4. Use a set instead of a vector for `b`: The vector `b` is used to store the remaining elements of `r` that have not been used yet. However, the program checks if `a[i]` is less than `b[j] + eps`, which requires a linear search in `b`. Instead, we can use a set to store the elements of `b`, which allows for efficient membership checking and insertion.

5. Avoid unnecessary function calls: The program calls the `chk` function multiple times to check if a subset of `mb` satisfies a certain condition. However, the `chk` function can be modified to take the current positions in `a` and `b` as arguments, avoiding the need for multiple function calls.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp

  auto c3 = [](const P &a, const P &b, const P &c) {
    ld A = norm(b - c);
    ld B = norm(c - a);
    ld C = norm(a - b);
    ld S = abs(cross(b - a, c - a));
    P p = (A * (B + C - A) * a + B * (C + A - B) * b + C * (A + B - C) * c) /
          (4 * S * S);
    ld r = abs(p - a);
    return make_pair(r, p);
  };
  auto c2 = [](const P &a, const P &b) {
    P c = (a + b) / (ld)2;
    ld r = abs(a - c);
    return make_pair(r, c);
  };
  auto in_circle = [](const P &a, const C &c) {
    return norm(a - c.pnt) <= c.rad * c.rad + eps;
  };
  int n = ps.size();

Explanation of the optimization steps:

1. Removed unnecessary includes: The unnecessary `bits/stdc++.h` include was removed and only the necessary headers were included.

2. Avoided unnecessary conversions: The unnecessary conversion from `ld` to `ld` was removed.

3. Avoided unnecessary sorting: The vectors `a` and `b` were not sorted and two pointers were used to keep track of the current positions in `a` and `b`.

4. Used a set instead of a vector for `b`: The vector `b` was replaced with a set, which allows for efficient membership checking and insertion.

5. Avoided unnecessary function calls: The `chk` function was modified to take the current positions in `a` and `b` as arguments, avoiding the need for multiple function calls.
