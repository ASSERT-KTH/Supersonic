The given program is a solution to a problem that involves finding a set of indices that satisfy certain conditions. The program uses a brute force approach to check all possible combinations of indices to find a valid solution.

To optimize the program, we can use a different approach to find a valid solution without checking all possible combinations. Here's the step-by-step optimization process:

1. Remove unnecessary header files: The program includes several unnecessary header files such as <algorithm>, <cmath>, <cstdio>, <cstring>, <ctime>, <iostream>, <sstream>, <string>, and <utility>. These header files are not used in the program and can be removed.

2. Remove unnecessary typedefs: The program defines several unnecessary typedefs such as ll, vi, vvi, and pii. These typedefs are not used in the program and can be removed.
