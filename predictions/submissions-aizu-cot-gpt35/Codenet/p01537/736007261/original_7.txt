The main bottleneck in the given program is the `chk` function. It is called multiple times in a loop and has a time complexity of O(n*m), where n is the number of radii and m is the number of balls. The `chk` function checks if a subset of balls can be covered by a subset of radii. 

To optimize the program, we can improve the `chk` function by sorting the radii and balls before comparing them. This way, we can reduce the time complexity of the function to O(n*log(n) + m*log(m)), where n is the number of radii and m is the number of balls.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#define _CRT_SECURE_NO_WARNINGS
#include <algorithm>
#include <cmath>
#include <cstdio>
#include <cstring>
#include <ctime>
#include <iostream>

#include <utility>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;
typedef long long ll;
