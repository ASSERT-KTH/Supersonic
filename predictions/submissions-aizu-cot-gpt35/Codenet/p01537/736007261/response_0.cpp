The given program calculates the minimum enclosing circle of a set of points and tries to find a subset of circles that enclose each other in a specific order. The program uses a brute force approach to find the subset by trying all possible combinations.

To optimize the program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The program includes several unnecessary header files, such as `<algorithm>`, `<cmath>`, `<cstring>`, `<ctime>`, `<iostream>`, `<sstream>`, and `<string>`. We can remove these includes as they are not used in the program.

2. Remove unnecessary typedefs: The program defines several unnecessary typedefs, such as `typedef long long ll`, `typedef vector<int> vi`, `typedef vector<vi> vvi`, and `typedef pair<int, int> pii`. We can remove these typedefs as they are not used in the program.
