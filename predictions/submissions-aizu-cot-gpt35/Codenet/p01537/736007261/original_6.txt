To optimize the given C/C++ program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary header files: The program includes multiple header files that are not used. We can remove the following header files: `cmath`, `cstdio`, `cstring`, `ctime`, `iostream`, `sstream`, `string`, `utility`, `vector`, `algorithm`, `complex`. These header files are not used in the program and their inclusion is unnecessary.

2. Remove unused typedefs and macros: The program defines multiple typedefs and macros that are not used. We can remove the following typedefs: `ll`, `vi`, `vvi`, `pii`. We can also remove the following macros: `all(c)`, `loop(i, a, b)`, `rep(i, b)`, `each(e, c)`, `pb`, `eb`, `mp`, `mt`, `lb`, `ub`, `dump(...)`. These typedefs and macros are not used in the program and their definition is unnecessary
