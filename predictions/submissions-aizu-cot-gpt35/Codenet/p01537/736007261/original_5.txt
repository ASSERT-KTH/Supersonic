Explanation of the optimization steps:

1. Remove unnecessary header files: The program includes several header files that are not used in the code. Removing these unnecessary header files will improve the compilation time and reduce the memory usage.

2. Remove unnecessary typedefs: The program uses typedefs for long long and vector<int> types, but these typedefs are not used in the code. Removing these unnecessary typedefs will improve the readability of the code.

3. Remove unnecessary macros: The program defines several macros that are not used in the code. Removing these unnecessary macros will improve the clarity of the code.

4. Remove unnecessary using namespace statement: The program uses the "using namespace std;" statement, which is generally considered bad practice. Instead, we can use the std:: prefix to specify the namespace for the standard library functions and types.

5. Remove duplicate header files: The program includes the same header files multiple times. Removing the duplicate includes will improve the compilation time and reduce the memory usage.

6. Remove duplicate function definitions: The program
