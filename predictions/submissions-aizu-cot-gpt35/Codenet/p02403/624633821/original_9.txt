Optimization Steps:
1. Avoid unnecessary includes: The program includes `<algorithm>` and `<stdio.h>` which are not required. We can remove them.

2. Avoid using `using namespace std;`: It is recommended to avoid using `using namespace std;` in order to prevent potential naming conflicts. We can qualify the usages of `cin` and `printf` with `std::` instead.

3. Use `std::cin` and `std::cout` instead of `printf` and `scanf`: Using `std::cin` and `std::cout` is generally more efficient and safer than using `printf` and `scanf`. We can replace the `printf` and `scanf` statements with `std::cout` and `std::cin` respectively.

4. Use a constant value for the array size: Instead of hardcoding the array sizes as 100, we can use a constant value to make it more maintainable. We can define a constant `const int MAX_SIZE = 100;` and use it for the array sizes.

5. Avoid unnecessary increment and comparison in the second loop: The variable `b` is being incremented after each iteration of the second loop and compared with `a` to determine the exit condition. We can simplify this by using a `while` loop with just the exit condition `b < a`.

6. Avoid unnecessary newline characters: The `printf("\n")` statements are adding extra newline characters after each iteration of the inner loops. We can remove them to reduce unnecessary output.

7. Avoid unnecessary increment of `b` inside the loop: The variable `b` is being incremented at the end of each iteration of the second loop. We can move this increment to the end of the while loop to avoid an unnecessary increment inside the loop.

8. Avoid unnecessary increment of `a` inside the first loop: The variable `a` is being incremented after reading the input values. We can avoid this increment by checking the condition inside the `while` loop itself.

9. Use `std::endl` instead of `"\n"`: `std::endl` ensures flushing the output buffer and adds a newline character. We can replace `"\n"` with `std::endl` to ensure consistent behavior.

10. Use a more meaningful variable name: The variable `a` is not descriptive of its purpose. We can rename it to `numPairs` to make it more clear.

Optimized Program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

const int MAX_SIZE = 100;

int main() {
  int numPairs = 0, H[MAX_SIZE], W[MAX_SIZE];

  while (true) {
    std::cin >> H[numPairs] >> W[numPairs];
    if (H[numPairs] == 0 && W[numPairs] == 0)
      break;
    numPairs++;
  }

  int pairIndex = 0;
  while (pairIndex < numPairs) {
    for (int i = 0; i < H[pairIndex]; i++) {
      for (int j = 0; j < W[pairIndex]; j++) {
        std::cout << "#";
      }
      std::cout << std::endl;
    }
    pairIndex++;
    std::cout << std::endl;
  }

  return 0;
}
```
