The given program reads pairs of integers from the user until it encounters a pair of 0s. Then, it prints a rectangle of '#' characters for each pair of integers, representing the height and width of the rectangle.

To optimize this program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary headers: The `<algorithm>` header is not used in the program, so we can remove it.

2. Remove `using namespace std;`: The `using namespace std;` statement is generally discouraged in C++ programs as it can lead to naming conflicts. Instead, we can use the `std::` prefix for the required standard library functions and objects.

3. Use `std::array` instead of C-style arrays: Instead of using C-style arrays `H` and `W`, we can use `std::array` from the `<array>` header. This allows us to have a fixed-size array with better type safety.

4. Use `std::cin` and `std::cout` instead of `printf` and `scanf`: The `std::cin` and `std::cout` stream objects are type-safe alternatives to `scanf` and `printf`. We can use them to read input and print output.

5. Avoid unnecessary increment of `b`: Instead of incrementing `b` at the end of the loop body, we can use a `for` loop with `b` as the loop variable.

6. Avoid printing an extra newline at the end: The original program prints an extra newline at the end, which can be avoided.

Here's the optimized program with the above modifications:

```cpp
#include <array>
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  int a = 0;
  std::array<int, 100> H, W;
  
  while (true) {
    std::cin >> H[a] >> W[a];
    if (H[a] == 0 && W[a] == 0)
      break;
    a++;
  }
  
  for (int b = 0; b < a; b++) {
    for (int i = 0; i < H[b]; i++) {
      for (int j = 0; j < W[b]; j++) {
        std::cout << "#";
      }
      std::cout << "\n";
    }
    if (b < a - 1)
      std::cout << "\n";
  }
  
  return 0;
}
```
