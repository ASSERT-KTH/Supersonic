The given program is a C++ program that reads a string input and counts the number of consecutive occurrences of "JOI" in the string. It then finds the maximum count of consecutive "O" in the "JOI" sequence and prints it.

To optimize this program, we can eliminate the need to store the entire input string in memory. We can modify the program to read the input character by character and perform the count and comparison operations on the go. This will reduce memory usage and improve running time.

Here's the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <cstdio>

int main() {
  int a = 0, b = 0, c = 0, maxi = 0;
  char ch;
  
  while (scanf("%c", &ch) != EOF) {
    if (ch == 'J') {
      b++;
      while (scanf("%c", &ch) != EOF && ch == 'O') {
        c++;
        while (scanf("%c", &ch) != EOF && ch == 'I') {
          a++;
          if (b >= c && c <= a) {
            maxi = (c > maxi) ? c : maxi;
          }
        }
        a = 0;
      }
      c = 0;
    }
  }
  
  printf("%d\n", maxi);
  scanf("%d", &a);
  return 0;
}
```

Explanation of the optimization steps:
1. Removed unnecessary header files `<algorithm>`, `<cstring>`, and `<string>`.
2. Removed the unused variables `e`, `f`, `i`, `j`, `k`.
3. Removed the unnecessary `fill()` function call as the program overwrites the array `x` with the input string.
4. Replaced the `while (1)` loops with `while (scanf("%c", &ch) != EOF)` loops to read the input character by character.
5. Removed the need to store the entire input string in memory (`x` array) and instead perform the count and comparison operations on the go.
6. Replaced the `max()` function call with a conditional statement to find the maximum count (`maxi`).
7. Removed the unused variables `e`, `f`, `i`, `j`, `k`.

The optimized program performs the same functionality as the original program but with reduced memory usage and improved running time.
