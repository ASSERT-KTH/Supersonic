To optimize the given C/C++ program, I have identified the following steps:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The program includes `<algorithm>`, `<cstdio>`, and `<string>` but does not use any functions from these headers. Therefore, these includes can be removed.

2. Remove unnecessary variable initializations: The variables `e`, `f`, `i`, `j`, `k` are declared but not used. These initializations can be removed.

3. Optimize loop conditions: The program uses `while (1)` loops with `if` conditions to break out of the loops. Instead of using `while (1)`, we can optimize the loop conditions to make them more readable.

4. Remove unnecessary array initialization: The array `x` is filled with the character 'A' but later overwritten by user input using `scanf`. We can remove the array initialization to save memory.

Based on these optimizations, here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <cstdio>
#include <cstring>

int main() {
  char x[1000005];
  scanf("%s", x);
  int leng = strlen(x);
  int a = 0, b = 0, c = 0, d = 0, maxi = 0;
  
  while (a < leng) {
    if (x[a] != 'J') {
      a++;
    } else {
      while (x[a] == 'J') {
        b++;
        a++;
      }
      while (x[a] == 'O') {
        c++;
        a++;
      }
      while (x[a] == 'I') {
        d++;
        a++;
      }
      if (b >= c && c <= d) {
        maxi = (c > maxi) ? c : maxi;
      }
      b = 0;
      c = 0;
      d = 0;
    }
  }
  
  printf("%d\n", maxi);
  scanf("%d", &a);
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized program removes unnecessary includes and variable initializations, optimizes loop conditions, and removes unnecessary array initialization.
