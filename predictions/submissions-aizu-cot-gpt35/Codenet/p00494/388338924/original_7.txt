To optimize the given program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The program includes unnecessary headers like `<algorithm>`, `<cstdio>`, and `<string>`. Since these headers are not used in the program, we can remove them.

2. Remove unused variables: The variables `e`, `f`, `i`, `j`, `k` are declared but not used in the program. We can safely remove these variables to improve readability.

3. Use `std::string` instead of character array: Instead of using a character array `x`, we can use `std::string` to simplify the code and avoid potential buffer overflow issues.

4. Use `std::cin` instead of `scanf`: Using `std::cin` for input instead of `scanf` can improve the readability and efficiency of the code.

5. Avoid unnecessary loops: The program currently uses nested while loops to count the occurrences of 'J', 'O', and 'I'. We can simplify this by using a single loop and tracking the counts of 'J', 'O', and 'I' in separate variables.

6. Remove unnecessary if conditions: The program has multiple if conditions to check the current character. We can avoid these if conditions by using a switch statement and directly incrementing the corresponding count variables.

7. Optimize the calculation of `maxi`: Instead of using `max(maxi, c)` to update `maxi`, we can use a simple comparison and assignment to update `maxi` directly.

Here's the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  string x;
  x.resize(1000005, 'A');
  cin >> x;
  int leng = x.length();
  int a = 0, b = 0, c = 0, d = 0, maxi = 0;
  while (a < leng) {
    switch (x[a]) {
      case 'J':
        b++;
        a++;
        break;
      case 'O':
        c++;
        a++;
        break;
      case 'I':
        d++;
        a++;
        break;
      default:
        a++;
        break;
    }
    if (b >= c && c <= d) {
      maxi = c;
    }
  }
  cout << maxi << endl;
  cin >> a;
  return 0;
}
```

By making these optimizations, we have simplified the code while improving its efficiency and readability.
