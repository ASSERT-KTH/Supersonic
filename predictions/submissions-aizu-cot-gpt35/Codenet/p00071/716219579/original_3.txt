Optimization step by step:

1. Remove unnecessary headers: 
    - The program does not use all the headers included. Remove the headers that are not needed in the program.

2. Remove unnecessary macros:
    - The program contains some macros that are not used. Remove the macros that are not needed in the program.

3. Use `int` instead of `long long` for loop variables:
    - The loop variables `i` in the `FOR` and `REP` macros are declared as `long long`, but they can be changed to `int` since they are used within the range of an `int`.

4. Remove unused variables:
    - The variables `P`, `V`, and `EPS` are declared but not used in the program. Remove these variables.

5. Optimize the solve function:
    - The solve function is called recursively and checks all possible cells in the grid. However, we can optimize it by using a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm. Instead of checking all cells in all directions, we can check only the adjacent cells that have a value of 1. This will reduce the number of recursive calls and improve the running time.

6. Optimize input/output operations:
    - The program uses `cin` and `cout` for input/output operations which can be slow for large inputs/outputs. We can optimize the input/output operations by using `scanf` and `printf` functions instead.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <cstdio>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int n;
int y, x, M[9][9];
int dx[] = {1, 0, -1, 0};
int dy[] = {0, 1, 0, -1};

void solve(int y, int x) {
  M[y][x] = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
    int ny = y + dy[i], nx = x + dx[i];
    if (ny >= 0 && ny < 8 && nx >= 0 && nx < 8 && M[ny][nx] == 1) {
      solve(ny, nx);
    }
  }
}

int main() {
  scanf("%d", &n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j < 8; j++) {
      char s[10];
      scanf("%s", s);
      for (int k = 0; k < 8; k++) {
        M[j][k] = s[k] - '0';
      }
    }
    scanf("%d %d", &x, &y);
    solve(y - 1, x - 1);
    printf("Data %d:\n", i + 1);
    for (int j = 0; j < 8; j++) {
      for (int k = 0; k < 8; k++) {
        printf("%d", M[j][k]);
      }
      printf("\n");
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```
