The given program solves a problem where it modifies a 2D matrix based on certain rules. It reads in an integer n, followed by n sets of input. Each set consists of 8 lines, with each line containing 8 characters ('0' or '1') representing the initial state of the matrix. After reading the matrix, it reads in two integers x and y, representing the coordinates of a cell in the matrix. It then applies a recursive algorithm to modify the matrix based on certain rules.

To optimize this program for running time and memory usage, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary include statements: The program includes multiple unnecessary header files. We should remove the include statements for header files that are not used in the program.

2. Remove unnecessary using namespace statement: The program uses "using namespace std;", which imports all the names from the std namespace into the global namespace. This can cause naming conflicts and is generally considered bad practice. We should remove this statement and use the std:: prefix when necessary.

3. Remove unnecessary typedefs and define statements: The program defines multiple typedefs and macros that are not used. We should remove these unnecessary definitions.

4. Optimize the solve function: The solve function is a recursive function that modifies the matrix based on certain rules. However, it uses a nested loop to iterate over the neighboring cells. We can optimize this function by using a queue-based BFS (Breadth-First Search) algorithm instead of recursion. This will avoid the function call overhead and improve the running time.

5. Optimize the main function: The main function reads the input, calls the solve function, and prints the modified matrix. We can optimize this function by removing unnecessary nested loops and using a more efficient way to print the matrix.

Here is the optimized C++ program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>
#include <vector>

int main() {
    int n;
    std::cin >> n;

    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        std::vector<std::vector<int>> M(8, std::vector<int>(8));
        for (int j = 0; j < 8; j++) {
            std::string s;
            std::cin >> s;
            for (int k = 0; k < 8; k++) {
                M[j][k] = s[k] - '0';
            }
        }

        int x, y;
        std::cin >> x >> y;
        x--, y--;

        std::queue<std::pair<int, int>> q;
        q.push({y, x});

        while (!q.empty()) {
            auto [cy, cx] = q.front();
            q.pop();

            if (M[cy][cx] == 0) {
                continue;
            }

            M[cy][cx] = 0;

            for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
                for (int j = 1; j <= 3; j++) {
                    int ny = cy + j * (i == 1) - j * (i == 3);
                    int nx = cx + j * (i == 0) - j * (i == 2);

                    if (ny >= 0 && ny < 8 && nx >= 0 && nx < 8 && M[ny][nx] == 1) {
                        q.push({ny, nx});
                    }
                }
            }
        }

        std::cout << "Data " << i + 1 << ":" << std::endl;
        for (int j = 0; j < 8; j++) {
            for (int k = 0; k < 8; k++) {
                std::cout << M[j][k];
            }
            std::cout << std::endl;
        }
    }

    return 0;
}
```

Explanation of optimizations:

1. We removed unnecessary include statements for header files that are not used in the program.

2. We removed the using namespace std; statement and used the std:: prefix when necessary.

3. We removed unnecessary typedefs and define statements that were not used in the program.

4. We optimized the solve function by replacing the recursive algorithm with a queue-based BFS algorithm. This avoids the function call overhead and improves the running time.

5. We optimized the main function by removing unnecessary nested loops and using a more efficient way to print the matrix.
