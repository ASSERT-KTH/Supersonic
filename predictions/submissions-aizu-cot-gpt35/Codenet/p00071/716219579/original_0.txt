The given program solves a grid-based problem where each cell in the grid can be either 0 or 1. It takes an input value `n` which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an input grid, starting position `(x, y)`, and applies a recursive function `solve()` to mark the connected cells with 1 as 0.

To optimize the program for running time and memory usage, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary header files: The program includes several unnecessary header files. We can remove them to reduce the compile time and memory usage.

2. Use `'\n'` instead of `endl`: The program uses `cout << endl` to print a new line. However, `endl` flushes the output buffer, which can be expensive. We can use `'\n'` instead to improve the program's running time.

3. Avoid unnecessary recursion: The `solve()` function uses recursion to mark the connected cells with 1 as 0. However, we can optimize this process by using an iterative approach instead of recursion. This will reduce the function call overhead and improve the program's running time.

4. Optimize the loop conditions: The nested loops in the `solve()` function can be optimized by modifying the loop conditions. Instead of looping `j` from 1 to 3, we can loop `j` from 3 to 1 in reverse order. This way, the inner loop will execute fewer iterations in most cases, improving the program's running time.

5. Avoid unnecessary checks: The `solve()` function checks if the current cell is within the grid bounds before making a recursive call. However, the loop conditions already ensure that the next cell is within the grid bounds. We can remove the additional checks to improve the program's running time.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

typedef vector<int> V;

int main() {
  int n;
  cin >> n;

  for (int t = 0; t < n; t++) {
    vector<V> M(8, V(8));
    for (int i = 0; i < 8; i++) {
      string s;
      cin >> s;
      for (int j = 0; j < 8; j++) {
        M[i][j] = s[j] - '0';
      }
    }

    int x, y;
    cin >> x >> y;
    x--, y--;

    vector<pair<int, int>> moves = {{1, 0}, {0, 1}, {-1, 0}, {0, -1}};

    M[y][x] = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
      for (int j = 3; j >= 1; j--) {
        int ny = y + moves[i].second * j;
        int nx = x + moves[i].first * j;
        if (M[ny][nx] == 1) {
          M[ny][nx] = 0;
        }
      }
    }

    cout << "Data " << t + 1 << ":" << '\n';
    for (int i = 0; i < 8; i++) {
      for (int j = 0; j < 8; j++) {
        cout << M[i][j];
      }
      cout << '\n';
    }
  }

  return 0;
}
```

Explanation of optimization steps:

1. Removed unnecessary header files.

2. Replaced `endl` with `'\n'` for better performance.

3. Replaced the recursive function `solve()` with an iterative approach. The `moves` vector stores the possible moves in each direction. We iterate over each direction and apply the moves in reverse order to mark the connected cells with 1 as 0.

4. Modified the loop conditions in the `solve()` function to loop `j` from 3 to 1 in reverse order. This reduces the number of iterations in most cases.

5. Removed unnecessary checks for grid bounds in the `solve()` function. The loop conditions already ensure that the next cell is within the grid bounds.
