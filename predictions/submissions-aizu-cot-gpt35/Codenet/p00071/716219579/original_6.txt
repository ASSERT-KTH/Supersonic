The given program is a simple implementation of a flood fill algorithm. It takes an input grid, starting coordinates, and recursively fills connected cells with zeros.

To optimize the program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary header files: The program includes several unnecessary header files that are not used in the code. We can remove them to improve compilation time and reduce memory usage.

2. Remove unused macros: The program defines several macros that are not used. We can remove them to simplify the code.

3. Use `int` instead of `long long` for loop variables: The loop variables `i` and `N` are defined as `long long`, which is unnecessary. We can change them to `int` to save memory.

4. Pass the input grid as a reference: The `solve` function modifies the input grid by setting cells to zero. Instead of passing the grid as a global variable, we can pass it as a reference to avoid unnecessary memory usage and improve performance.

5. Avoid unnecessary recursion: The `solve` function uses recursion to fill connected cells. However, we can optimize it by using a queue-based approach instead of recursion. This will reduce stack memory usage and improve performance.

6. Avoid unnecessary string conversion: The input grid is read as a string and then converted to integers. We can directly read integers from input to avoid unnecessary string conversions.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
using namespace std;

const int dx[] = {1, 0, -1, 0};
const int dy[] = {0, 1, 0, -1};

void solve(vector<vector<int>>& M, int y, int x) {
  M[y][x] = 0;
  queue<pair<int, int>> q;
  q.push({y, x});

  while (!q.empty()) {
    int sy = q.front().first;
    int sx = q.front().second;
    q.pop();

    for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
      for (int j = 1; j <= 3; j++) {
        int ny = sy + dy[i] * j;
        int nx = sx + dx[i] * j;
        if (ny >= 0 && ny < 8 && nx >= 0 && nx < 8 && M[ny][nx] == 1) {
          M[ny][nx] = 0;
          q.push({ny, nx});
        }
      }
    }
  }
}

int main() {
  int n;
  cin >> n;

  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    vector<vector<int>> M(8, vector<int>(8));
    for (int j = 0; j < 8; j++) {
      for (int k = 0; k < 8; k++) {
        cin >> M[j][k];
      }
    }

    int x, y;
    cin >> x >> y;
    solve(M, y - 1, x - 1);

    cout << "Data " << i + 1 << ":" << endl;
    for (int j = 0; j < 8; j++) {
      for (int k = 0; k < 8; k++) {
        cout << M[j][k];
      }
      cout << endl;
    }
  }

  return 0;
}
```

Explanation of optimizations:
1. Removed unnecessary header files: Removed the unnecessary header files that were not used in the code to improve compilation time and reduce memory usage.

2. Removed unused macros: Removed the unused macros to simplify the code.

3. Changed loop variables to `int`: Changed the loop variables `i` and `N` to `int` to save memory.

4. Passed the input grid as a reference: Passed the input grid as a reference to the `solve` function to avoid unnecessary memory usage and improve performance.

5. Used a queue-based approach instead of recursion: Replaced the recursive approach in the `solve` function with a queue-based approach to avoid unnecessary recursion and reduce stack memory usage.

6. Read integers directly from input: Read the input grid as integers directly instead of reading them as strings and converting them to integers. This avoids unnecessary string conversions.
