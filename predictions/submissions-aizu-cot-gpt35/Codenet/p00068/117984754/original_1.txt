To optimize the given program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The program includes the entire `<bits/stdc++.h>` header file, which is not necessary. We can remove it and include only the necessary headers.

2. Remove unused typedefs: The program defines `ll`, `pii`, and `vi` typedefs, but they are not used anywhere in the code. We can remove them.

3. Remove unused macros: The program defines `INF` and `EPS` macros, but they are not used anywhere in the code. We can remove them.

4. Remove unnecessary member functions from class `P`: The class `P` defines several member functions that are not used in the program. We can remove them to reduce unnecessary function calls.

5. Remove unnecessary member variables from struct `C` and struct `L`: The structs `C` and `L` define member variables that are not used in the program. We can remove them to reduce unnecessary memory usage.

6. Optimize the `isSimple` function: The `isSimple` function checks for intersections between line segments in a polygon. However, it uses a nested loop to compare each line segment with all other line segments. This can be optimized by using a different algorithm for checking line segment intersections, such as the Bentley-Ottmann algorithm or the sweep line algorithm.

7. Optimize the `isPointInsidePolygon` function: The `isPointInsidePolygon` function checks if a point is inside a polygon by counting the number of line segments that the point is to the left of. However, it can be optimized by using the ray casting algorithm, which only requires counting the number of crossings of a horizontal ray originating from the point.

8. Optimize the `convex_hull` function: The `convex_hull` function uses the Graham's scan algorithm to find the convex hull of a set of points. However, it can be optimized by using the Jarvis march algorithm or the quickhull algorithm, which have better average-case time complexity.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <cmath>

using namespace std;

class P {
public:
  double x, y;
  P(double _x = 0, double _y = 0) : x(_x), y(_y){};
};

bool cmp_x(const P &p, const P &q) {
  if (p.x != q.x)
    return p.x < q.x;
  return p.y < q.y;
}

vector<P> convex_hull(vector<P>& ps) {
  sort(ps.begin(), ps.end(), cmp_x);
  int n = ps.size();

  int k = 0;
  vector<P> qs(n * 2);

  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    while (k > 1 && ((qs[k - 1].x - qs[k - 2].x) * (ps[i].y - qs[k - 1].y) - (qs[k - 1].y - qs[k - 2].y) * (ps[i].x - qs[k - 1].x)) <= 0)
      k--;
    qs[k++] = ps[i];
  }

  for (int i = n - 2, t = k; i >= 0; i--) {
    while (k > t && ((qs[k - 1].x - qs[k - 2].x) * (ps[i].y - qs[k - 1].y) - (qs[k - 1].y - qs[k - 2].y) * (ps[i].x - qs[k - 1].x)) <= 0)
      k--;
    qs[k++] = ps[i];
  }

  qs.resize(k - 1);
  return qs;
}

int main() {
  int N;
  while (cin >> N && N) {
    vector<P> ps(N);
    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
      char ch;
      cin >> ps[i].x >> ch >> ps[i].y;
    }
    vector<P> res = convex_hull(ps);
    cout << N - res.size() << endl;
  }
}
```
