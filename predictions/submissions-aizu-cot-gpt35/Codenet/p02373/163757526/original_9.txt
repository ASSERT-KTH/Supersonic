This program finds the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two nodes in a tree. The optimization can be done in the `build` function and the `lca` function.

First, let's analyze the time complexity of the current program:
- The `dfs` function has a time complexity of O(V + E), where V is the number of nodes and E is the number of edges in the tree.
- The `build` function has a time complexity of O(N log N), where N is the total number of nodes in the tree.
- The `lca` function has a time complexity of O(log N).

To optimize the program for running time, we can improve the `build` function. Currently, it has a time complexity of O(N log N) because it iterates over each element in the `path` array multiple times. We can reduce this time complexity to O(N) by using a technique called "sparse table" or "range minimum query (RMQ)".

The sparse table is a data structure that preprocesses the array to efficiently answer range minimum queries. It uses dynamic programming to build a table with each entry representing the minimum value in a range of the array. By using this data structure, we can reduce the time complexity of the `lca` function from O(log N) to O(1).

To implement the sparse table, we need to modify the `build` function as follows:
1. Calculate the value of `h` as the maximum power of 2 that is less than or equal to `n`.
2. Initialize the `ST` array with the same size as the `path` array.
3. Copy the values from the `path` array to the first row of the `ST` array.
4. Build the sparse table using dynamic programming. For each row `i` (starting from 1) and each column `j` (starting from 0), calculate `ST[i][j]` as the minimum of `ST[i-1][j]` and `ST[i-1][j + (1 << (i-1))]`.
5. The `build` function is now complete.

Next, we need to modify the `lca` function to use the sparse table for efficient LCA calculations. Currently, it iterates over the `ST` array to find the minimum value within a range. We can replace this iteration with a direct query to the sparse table.

To implement this optimization, we need to modify the `lca` function as follows:
1. Calculate the values of `l` and `r` as the indices of `u` and `v` in the `idx_in_path` array.
2. Swap `l` and `r` if `l` is greater than `r`.
3. Calculate the value of `p` as the maximum power of 2 that is less than or equal to `r - l + 1`.
4. Return the minimum of `ST[p][l]` and `ST[p][r - (1 << p) + 1]`.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
#define fi first
#define se second
typedef pair<int, int> ii;
typedef vector<int> vi;
const int MAXN = 100005;
const int LOGN = 20;
int idx_in_path[MAXN];
ii path[MAXN << 1];
vi adjList[MAXN];
int path_size = 0;
void dfs(int u, int depth = 0) {
  idx_in_path[u] = path_size;
  path[path_size++] = ii(depth, u);
  for (int v : adjList[u]) {
    dfs(v, depth + 1);
    path[path_size++] = ii(depth, u);
  }
}
ii ST[LOGN][MAXN << 1];
void build(int n) {
  int h = 31 - __builtin_clz(n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    ST[0][i] = path[i];
  for (int i = 1; i <= h; i++)
    for (int j = 0; j + (1 << i) <= n; j++)
      ST[i][j] = min(ST[i - 1][j], ST[i - 1][j + (1 << (i - 1))]);
}
int lca(int u, int v) {
  int l = idx_in_path[u], r = idx_in_path[v];
  if (l > r)
    swap(l, r);
  int p = 31 - __builtin_clz(r - l + 1);
  return min(ST[p][l], ST[p][r - (1 << p) + 1]).se;
}
int main() {
  int num_nodes;
  scanf("%d", &num_nodes);
  for (int u = 0; u < num_nodes; u++) {
    int num_neighbors;
    scanf("%d", &num_neighbors);
    for (int i = 0; i < num_neighbors; i++) {
      int v;
      scanf("%d", &v);
      adjList[u].push_back(v);
    }
  }
  dfs(0);
  build(path_size);
  int num_queries;
  scanf("%d", &num_queries);
  for (int i = 0; i < num_queries; i++) {
    int u, v;
    scanf("%d%d", &u, &v);
    printf("%d\n", lca(u, v));
  }
  return 0;
}
```

The optimization steps are as follows:

1. In the `build` function, calculate the value of `h` as the maximum power of 2 that is less than or equal to `n`. This reduces the number of iterations in the outer loop from `n` to `h`.
2. In the `lca` function, calculate the value of `p` as the maximum power of 2 that is less than or equal to `r - l + 1`. This reduces the number of iterations in the inner loop from `r - l + 1` to `p`.
3. In the `lca` function, change the indexing of `ST[p][r - (1 << p)]` to `ST[p][r - (1 << p) + 1]`. This ensures that the range includes both `l` and `r`.
4. Replace the `ceil(log2(n + 1))` calculation in the `build` function with `31 - __builtin_clz(n)`. This calculates the logarithm base 2 of `n` in an efficient way.
