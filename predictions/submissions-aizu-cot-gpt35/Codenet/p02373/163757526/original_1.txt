The given program is a solution to the Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA) problem using the Euler tour technique and a Sparse Table data structure. The program first builds the Euler tour path and then constructs the Sparse Table. Finally, it answers multiple LCA queries using the precomputed data.

To optimize the program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The program includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header, which includes all the standard headers. However, most of them are not needed for this program. We can remove this include and only include the necessary headers.

2. Optimize the data types: The program uses `int` for storing node IDs and depths. However, the number of nodes is limited to `MAXN`, which is defined as 100005. We can use a smaller data type like `short` or `unsigned short` to save memory.

3. Optimize the `path` array size: The `path` array is currently defined with a size of `MAXN << 1`. However, the actual size needed is equal to the number of edges in the graph, which is at most `(num_nodes - 1)`. We can update the size of the `path` array accordingly.

4. Optimize the `ST` array size: The `ST` array is currently defined with a size of `LOGN` by `MAXN << 1`. Since the actual size needed is determined by the number of edges in the graph, we can update the size of the `ST` array accordingly.

5. Use a more efficient algorithm for finding the minimum in the Sparse Table: The current implementation finds the minimum using two `min()` function calls, which can be optimized to a single call.

Here's the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <cmath>
#include <algorithm>

typedef std::pair<unsigned short, unsigned short> ii;
typedef std::vector<unsigned short> vi;

const unsigned short MAXN = 100005;
const unsigned short LOGN = 17;

unsigned short idx_in_path[MAXN];
ii path[(MAXN - 1) << 1];
std::vector<unsigned short> adjList[MAXN];
unsigned short path_size = 0;

void dfs(unsigned short u, unsigned short depth = 0) {
  idx_in_path[u] = path_size;
  path[path_size++] = ii(depth, u);
  for (unsigned short v : adjList[u]) {
    dfs(v, depth + 1);
    path[path_size++] = ii(depth, u);
  }
}

ii ST[LOGN][(MAXN - 1) << 1];

void build(unsigned short n) {
  unsigned short h = std::ceil(std::log2(n + 1));
  for (unsigned short i = 0; i < n; i++)
    ST[0][i] = path[i];
  for (unsigned short i = 1; i < h; i++) {
    for (unsigned short j = 0; j + (1 << i) <= n; j++) {
      ST[i][j] = std::min(ST[i - 1][j], ST[i - 1][j + (1 << (i - 1))]);
    }
  }
}

unsigned short lca(unsigned short u, unsigned short v) {
  unsigned short l = idx_in_path[u], r = idx_in_path[v];
  if (l > r)
    std::swap(l, r);
  r++;
  unsigned short p = LOGN - 1 - __builtin_clz(r - l);
  return std::min(ST[p][l], ST[p][r - (1 << p)]).second;
}

int main() {
  unsigned short num_nodes;
  std::cin >> num_nodes;
  for (unsigned short u = 0; u < num_nodes; u++) {
    unsigned short num_neighbors;
    std::cin >> num_neighbors;
    for (unsigned short i = 0; i < num_neighbors; i++) {
      unsigned short v;
      std::cin >> v;
      adjList[u].push_back(v);
    }
  }
  dfs(0);
  build(path_size);
  unsigned short num_queries;
  std::cin >> num_queries;
  for (unsigned short i = 0; i < num_queries; i++) {
    unsigned short u, v;
    std::cin >> u >> v;
    std::cout << lca(u, v) << std::endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Explanation of the optimizations:

1. We removed the unnecessary `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` and included only the necessary headers.
2. We changed the data types from `int` to `unsigned short` to save memory.
3. We updated the size of the `path` array to `(MAXN - 1) << 1` to match the actual number of edges in the graph.
4. We updated the size of the `ST` array to `LOGN` by `(MAXN - 1) << 1` to match the actual number of edges in the graph.
5. We used a more efficient algorithm for finding the minimum in the Sparse Table by replacing two `min()` function calls with a single call.
6. We replaced `scanf()` and `printf()` with `std::cin` and `std::cout` for standard input/output operations.
