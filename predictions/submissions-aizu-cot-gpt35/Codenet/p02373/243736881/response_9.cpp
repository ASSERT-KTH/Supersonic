Optimization:

1. Use a `vector` instead of an array for `color`, `par`, `depth`, `top`, and `goUp`. This will reduce memory usage and improve cache locality.

2. Remove the unnecessary `tord` vector and use a single loop to iterate over the vertices in `tord` while decomposing the graph. This will reduce memory usage and improve runtime.

3. Remove the unnecessary `while` loop that clears the queue `q` after each decomposition. Instead, reuse the same queue for each decomposition. This will reduce memory usage and improve runtime.

4. Use a `vector` instead of an array for `vis` and initialize it with the required size at the beginning. This will reduce memory usage.

5. Use `emplace_back` instead of `push_back` to add elements to the graph vectors. This will improve runtime by avoiding unnecessary copying.

6. Use `reserve` to preallocate memory for the graph vectors based on the total number of vertices. This will improve runtime by avoiding frequent reallocations.

7. Remove the unnecessary `assert` statements in the `solve` function. This will improve runtime.

8. Use a more descriptive variable name instead of `c` in the `decomp` function.

9. Use `cout.tie(NULL)` to disable synchronization between `cout` and `cin`, improving runtime.
