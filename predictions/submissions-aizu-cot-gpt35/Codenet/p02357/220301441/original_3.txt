The given program is a C++ program that reads an integer `n` and `l`, followed by `n` integers. It then constructs a data structure `StaticRMQ` and uses it to find the minimum value in each contiguous subarray of length `l` in the given array.

To optimize the program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary header files: The program includes several header files that are not used. We can remove them to reduce unnecessary compilation time.

2. Remove unnecessary macros: The program defines several macros that are not used. We can remove them to simplify the code.

3. Remove unnecessary type definitions: The program defines several type aliases that are not used. We can remove them to simplify the code.

4. Simplify array initialization: The program initializes several arrays using `calloc` and `sizeof` operations. We can simplify the initialization by using the array's size directly.

5. Simplify array indexing: The program uses bitwise operations to perform array indexing. We can simplify the indexing by using regular array indexing.

6. Simplify loop conditions: The program uses bitwise operations and bit manipulation to check loop conditions. We can simplify the conditions by using regular comparison operators.

7. Simplify loop variables: The program uses bitwise operations and bit manipulation to calculate loop variables. We can simplify the calculations by using regular arithmetic operations.

8. Remove unused variables: The program defines several variables that are not used. We can remove them to simplify the code.

9. Simplify output statement: The program uses multiple `std::cout` statements to print the result. We can simplify the output statement by using a single `std::cout` statement with a loop.

Here's the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

template <typename T>
class StaticRMQ {
  std::vector<T> a;
  std::vector<std::vector<uint32_t>> table;

public:
  StaticRMQ(std::vector<T>& array) : a(array), table(array.size()) {
    for (uint32_t i = 0; i < array.size(); ++i) {
      table[i].resize(32 - __builtin_clz(array.size() - i));
      table[i][0] = i;
    }
    for (uint32_t j = 1; (1 << j) <= array.size(); ++j) {
      for (uint32_t i = 0; i + (1 << j) <= array.size(); ++i) {
        table[i][j] = (array[table[i][j - 1]] < array[table[i + (1 << (j - 1))][j - 1]]) ? table[i][j - 1] : table[i + (1 << (j - 1))][j - 1];
      }
    }
  }

  uint32_t operator()(uint32_t begin, uint32_t end) {
    uint32_t k = 31 - __builtin_clz(end - begin + 1);
    return (a[table[begin][k]] < a[table[end - (1 << k) + 1][k]]) ? a[table[begin][k]] : a[table[end - (1 << k) + 1][k]];
  }
};

int main() {
  std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  std::cin.tie(0);

  uint32_t n, l;
  std::cin >> n >> l;

  std::vector<uint32_t> a(n);
  for (uint32_t i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    std::cin >> a[i];
  }

  StaticRMQ<uint32_t> S(a);

  for (uint32_t i = 0; i <= n - l; ++i) {
    std::cout << S(i, i + l - 1) << " ";
  }

  std::cout << "\n";

  return 0;
}
```

Explanation of the optimizations:

1. Removed unnecessary header files: The program included several header files that were not used in the code. These unnecessary includes were removed to reduce unnecessary compilation time.

2. Removed unnecessary macros: The program defined several macros that were not used in the code. These unnecessary macros were removed to simplify the code.

3. Removed unnecessary type definitions: The program defined several type aliases that were not used in the code. These unnecessary type definitions were removed to simplify the code.

4. Simplified array initialization: The program originally initialized several arrays using `calloc` and `sizeof` operations. These initializations were simplified by using the array's size directly.

5. Simplified array indexing: The program originally used bitwise operations to perform array indexing. The indexing was simplified by using regular array indexing.
