To optimize the given C/C++ program, we can make the following changes:

1. Remove unnecessary header files: We don't need all the header files included in the original program. We can remove the following header files since they are not used: <algorithm>, <map>, <queue>, <set>, <stack>, <stdlib.h>, <time.h>, <utility>.

2. Remove unnecessary macros: The macros defined in the original program are not used. We can remove the following macros: INF, MOD, rep, bitget, ALL, C, scanf.

3. Remove unnecessary typedefs: The typedefs defined in the original program are not used. We can remove the following typedefs: int32, int64, uint32, uint64.

4. Simplify array initialization: The array initialization in the StaticRMQ constructor can be simplified. Instead of using std::calloc, we can use the std::vector constructor to create and initialize the arrays.

5. Optimize loop conditions: The loop conditions in the StaticRMQ constructor can be optimized. Instead of using array.size() repeatedly, we can store the size in a variable and reuse it.

6. Optimize loop variables: The loop variables in the StaticRMQ constructor can be optimized. Instead of using t and c as loop variables, we can use i and j respectively since they are more commonly used.

7. Use std::min_element: Instead of manually calculating the minimum value in the table, we can use std::min_element to find the minimum element in a range.

8. Simplify operator() implementation: The operator() implementation in the StaticRMQ class can be simplified. Instead of using bitwise operations, we can use array subscripting to access the elements.

Here is the optimized C/C++ program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

template <typename T>
class StaticRMQ {
  std::vector<T> a;
  std::vector<std::vector<uint32_t>> table;

public:
  StaticRMQ(std::vector<T>& array) {
    uint32_t n = array.size();
    a = array;
    table.resize(n, std::vector<uint32_t>(n));

    for (uint32_t i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
      table[i][i] = i;
      for (uint32_t j = i + 1; j < n; ++j) {
        table[i][j] = (a[table[i][j - 1]] < a[j]) ? table[i][j - 1] : j;
      }
    }
  }

  uint32_t operator()(uint32_t begin, uint32_t end) {
    return a[std::min_element(table[begin].begin() + begin, table[begin].begin() + end + 1) - table[begin].begin()];
  }
};

int main(void) {
  std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  std::cin.tie(0);

  uint32_t n, l;
  std::cin >> n >> l;

  std::vector<uint32_t> a(n);
  for (uint32_t i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    std::cin >> a[i];
  }

  StaticRMQ<uint32_t> S(a);
  std::cout << S(0, l);

  for (uint32_t i = 1; i < n - l + 1; ++i) {
    std::cout << " " << S(i, i + l);
  }

  std::cout << "\n";
  return 0;
}
```

Explanation of the optimization steps:

1. We removed unnecessary header files to reduce unnecessary dependencies and improve compilation time.

2. We removed unnecessary macros to simplify the code and improve readability.

3. We removed unnecessary typedefs to simplify the code and improve readability.

4. We simplified array initialization by using the std::vector constructor to create and initialize the arrays.

5. We optimized loop conditions by storing the size of the array in a variable and reusing it instead of calling array.size() repeatedly.

6. We optimized loop variables by using more commonly used loop variable names (i and j) instead of t and c.

7. We used std::min_element to find the minimum element in a range instead of manually calculating it.

8. We simplified the operator() implementation by using array subscripting instead of bitwise operations to access the elements.
