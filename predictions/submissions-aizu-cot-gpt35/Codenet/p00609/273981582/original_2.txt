Explanation of the optimization steps:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The program includes several unnecessary header files such as `iostream`, `set`, and `vector`. Since these headers are not used in the program, we can remove them to improve compilation time and reduce memory usage.

2. Remove unused typedef: The `typedef` for `ll` (long long) is not used in the program and can be removed.

3. Avoid using `using namespace std`: The program uses `using namespace std`, which brings all the names from the `std` namespace into the global namespace. This can lead to naming conflicts. It is better to use the `std::` prefix when accessing names from the `std` namespace.

4. Avoid unnecessary global constants: The program defines two global constants `EPS` and `PI`, but they are not used. We can remove these constants to improve memory usage.

5. Avoid unnecessary macros: The program defines several macros such as `REP`, `FOR`, `FOREQ`, and `FORIT`. These macros are not used in the program and can be removed.

6. Use `int64_t` instead of `long long`: The program uses `long long` to represent a 64-bit integer. It is better to use the standard type `int64_t` from the `<stdint.h>` header for portability.

7. Use `constexpr` instead of `inline`: The `inline` keyword is used to define inline functions, but modern C++ has a better alternative called `constexpr`. We can replace the `inline` keyword with `constexpr` for the `square` function.

8. Use `const` references for function parameters: The `dist2` function takes two `Point` objects by value, which causes unnecessary copying. We can change the function signature to use `const` references instead.

9. Use range-based for loop: The program uses a traditional for loop with an iterator to iterate over a set. We can simplify the loop using a range-based for loop, which is more concise and easier to read.

10. Avoid unnecessary find operation: The program uses `find` to search for an element in a set and then erase it. We can simplify this by using the `erase` function directly.

11. Avoid redundant type casting: The program casts the `type` member of `Point` to `int` in several places using `(int)p.type`. Since `type` is already an `int`, these type casts are redundant and can be removed.

12. Use `std::array` instead of C-style array: The program uses a C-style array `event` to store events. We can replace it with `std::array` from the `<array>` header, which provides a safer and more convenient way to handle arrays.

13. Use `std::tie` for comparison: The `operator<` for `Point` and `Event` compares multiple fields using if statements. We can simplify the comparison by using `std::tie` to compare the fields in a single line.

14. Avoid unnecessary construction of temporary objects: The program constructs two temporary `Point` objects in the `lower_bound` and `upper_bound` functions. We can avoid these constructions by using `std::make_pair` instead.

15. Optimize the `PlaneSweep` function: The `PlaneSweep` function uses a set to store open points. However, the set is not cleared between test cases, leading to unnecessary memory usage. We can clear the set at the beginning of each test case to optimize memory usage.

16. Optimize the `main` function: The `main` function uses a `while` loop to process multiple test cases. However, the loop condition `an | bn` can be simplified to `an && bn`, which is more intuitive. Additionally, we can use `std::array` to store the events instead of a raw C-style array.

Optimized program:

```cpp

#include <set>
#include <cstdint>

struct Point {

  bool operator<(const Point& rhs) const {
    return std::tie(y, x) < std::tie(rhs.y, rhs.x);
  }
};

struct Event {
  int x;
  Point p;
  bool in;
  Event() = default;
  Event(int x, Point p, bool in) : x(x), p(p), in(in) {}
  bool operator<(const Event& rhs) const {
    return std::tie(x, in) < std::tie(rhs.x, rhs.in);
  }
};

constexpr int64_t square(int x) {
  return static_cast<int64_t>(x) * x;
}

constexpr int64_t dist2(const Point& a, const Point& b) {
  return square(a.x - b.x) + square(a.y - b.y);
}

int PlaneSweep(const std::array<Event, 500000>& events, int n, int r) {
  int ans = 0;
  std::set<Point> open[2];
  for (int iter = 0; iter < n; iter++) {
    const Event& e = events[iter];
    const Point& p = e.p;
    if (e.in) {
      auto lower = open[p.type ^ 1].lower_bound(Point(0, p.y - 4 * r - 1, 0));
      auto upper = open[p.type ^ 1].upper_bound(Point(0, p.y + 4 * r + 1, 0));
      for (const auto& it : std::range(lower, upper)) {
        if (dist2(it, p) <= 16 * r * r) {
          ans++;
        }
      }
      open[p.type].insert(p);
    } else {
      open[p.type].erase(p);
    }
  }
  return ans;
}

int main() {
  int an, bn, r;
  while (scanf("%d %d %d", &an, &bn, &r) == 3 && (an && bn)) {
    int n = (an + bn) * 2;
    std::array<Event, 500000> events;
    for (int i = 0; i < an; i++) {
      int x, y;
      scanf("%d %d", &x, &y);
      events[2 * i + 0] = Event(x - 2 * r, Point(x, y, 0), true);
      events[2 * i + 1] = Event(x + 2 * r, Point(x, y, 0), false);
    }
    for (int i = 0; i < bn; i++) {
      int x, y;
      scanf("%d %d", &x, &y);
      events[2 * an + 2 * i + 0] = Event(x - 2 * r, Point(x, y, 1), true);
      events[2 * an + 2 * i + 1] = Event(x + 2 * r, Point(x, y, 1), false);
    }
    std::sort(events.begin(), events.begin() + n);
    int ans = PlaneSweep(events, n, r);
    printf("%d\n", ans);
  }
}
```

The optimized program applies several small changes to improve performance and reduce memory usage. These changes include removing unnecessary includes and global constants, using more efficient data structures, optimizing function parameters, and simplifying loops and comparison logic.
