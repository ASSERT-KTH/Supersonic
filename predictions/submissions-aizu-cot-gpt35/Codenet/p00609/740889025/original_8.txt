The given C++ program is a solution to a problem that involves counting the number of points within a certain distance of a set of given points. The program reads the test cases from the input and for each test case, it reads the input points and counts the number of points within the specified distance from each query point.

To optimize this program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Instead of using a vector of vectors (`vector<int> v[10000]`) to store the x-coordinates of the points for each y-coordinate, we can use a single vector of pairs (`vector<pii> v`). This will reduce the memory usage and improve cache locality.

2. We don't need to sort the x-coordinates for each y-coordinate separately. Instead, we can sort the entire vector of pairs based on the y-coordinate. This will allow us to perform a binary search for the range of x-coordinates within the specified distance for each query point.

3. Instead of using `scanf` and `printf` for input and output, we can use `cin` and `cout` which are generally faster.

Here is the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <cmath>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;
typedef pair<int, int> pii;

int main() {
  int aN, bN, R;
  while (cin >> aN >> bN >> R, aN) {
    vector<pii> v(aN);
    for (int i = 0; i < aN; i++) {
      cin >> v[i].second >> v[i].first;
    }
    sort(v.begin(), v.end());

    int D = 4 * R, ans = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < bN; i++) {
      int x, y;
      cin >> x >> y;
      auto lower = lower_bound(v.begin(), v.end(), make_pair(y - D, -1));
      auto upper = upper_bound(v.begin(), v.end(), make_pair(y + D, INT_MAX));
      for (auto it = lower; it != upper; it++) {
        int dx = x - it->second;
        int dy = y - it->first;
        if (dx * dx + dy * dy <= D * D) {
          ans++;
        }
      }
    }
    cout << ans << endl;
  }
}
```

In this optimized version, we use a single vector of pairs `v` to store the points. We read the input using `cin` and sort the vector based on the y-coordinate using `sort`. Then, for each query point, we use `lower_bound` and `upper_bound` to find the range of points with y-coordinates within the specified distance. Finally, we iterate over this range and calculate the distance between each point and the query point using the Pythagorean theorem. If the distance is within the specified distance, we increment the `ans` variable.
