Step by step optimization:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The program does not use any features from the `<cstdio>` header, so we can remove it.

2. Avoid using `using namespace std;` directive: This directive brings all the names from the `std` namespace into the global namespace, which can lead to naming conflicts. Instead, we can explicitly qualify the names we use from the `std` namespace.

3. Avoid using `cin` and `cout` for floating-point values: The `cin` and `cout` objects have a synchronization overhead for floating-point values. To avoid this, we can use the `scanf` and `printf` functions instead.

4. Use a more accurate value for pi: The original program uses an approximation of pi (`3.141592653589`) instead of a more accurate value. We can use the `M_PI` constant from the `<cmath>` header, which provides the value of pi with a higher precision.

5. Change the format specifier in `printf`: The original program uses the format specifier `%.8lf` to print the double values with 8 decimal places. We can use the `%.8f` format specifier instead, as it is sufficient for our requirements.

Optimized code:

```cpp
#include <cmath>
#include <cstdio>

int main() {
  double r, s, l;
  scanf("%lf", &r);
  s = M_PI * r * r;
  l = 2 * M_PI * r;
  printf("%.8f %.8f\n", s, l);
}
```
