The given program calculates the area and circumference of a circle using the formulae: s = r * r * x and l = x * (r + r), where r is the radius of the circle and x is the value of pi.

To optimize the program for running time and memory usage, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove the unnecessary inclusion of the `<iostream>` header as it is not used in the program.
2. Replace the `cin` and `cout` statements with `scanf` and `printf` respectively, as they are generally faster than their C++ counterparts.
3. Remove the `using namespace std` statement to avoid namespace pollution.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <cstdio>

int main() {
  double r, s, l, x;
  scanf("%lf", &r);
  x = 3.141592653589;
  s = r * r * x;
  l = x * (r + r);
  printf("%.8lf %.8lf\n", s, l);
}
```
