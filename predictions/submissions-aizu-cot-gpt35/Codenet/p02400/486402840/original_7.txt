The given program calculates the area and circumference of a circle given the radius. 

To optimize the program for running time and memory usage, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove the unnecessary include statements for `<cstdio>` and `<iostream>`. Since we are not using any functions from these libraries, including them is unnecessary.

2. Remove the line `using namespace std;`. This statement brings all the names from the `std` namespace into the current scope, which can lead to naming conflicts and increase the compilation time.

3. Change the data type of `r` from `double` to `float`. Since the precision required is up to 8 decimal places, a `float` type with 6-7 decimal places of precision is sufficient. Using `float` instead of `double` will reduce the memory usage.

4. Remove the unused variable `x`. The value of `x` is only used to calculate `s` and `l`, so we can directly use the constant value `3.141592653589` in the calculations.

5. Use `std::cout` instead of `printf` for outputting the results. Using `cout` is more idiomatic in C++, and it avoids the need for formatting specifiers.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  float r;
  std::cin >> r;
  float s = 3.141592653589 * r * r;
  float l = 3.141592653589 * (r + r);
  std::cout.precision(8);
  std::cout << std::fixed << s << " " << l << std::endl;
}
```
