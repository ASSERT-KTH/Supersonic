The given program calculates the area and circumference of a circle given its radius. 

To optimize the program, I would make the following changes:

1. Remove the unnecessary inclusion of `<iostream>`, as it is not used in the program.
2. Replace the `using namespace std;` directive with explicit `std::` namespace qualifications to avoid potential naming conflicts.
3. Replace the `printf` function with the `std::cout` stream for outputting the results, as it is more idiomatic for C++ code.
4. Remove the unnecessary assignment of `x = 3.141592653589;` and directly use the constant `3.141592653589` in the calculations.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <cstdio>

int main() {
  double r, s, l;
  std::cin >> r;
  s = r * r * 3.141592653589;
  l = 2 * 3.141592653589 * r;
  std::cout << std::fixed;
  std::cout.precision(8);
  std::cout << s << " " << l << "\n";
}
```
