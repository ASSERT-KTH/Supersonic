The original program calculates the area and circumference of a circle given its radius.

To optimize the program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove the unnecessary inclusion of the `<iostream>` header since it is not used in the program.
2. Replace the `cin` and `printf` functions with `scanf` and `printf` respectively, as they are faster and more efficient for input and output operations.
3. Remove the unnecessary variable `x` and directly use `3.141592653589` in the calculations.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <cstdio>

int main() {
  double r, s, l;
  scanf("%lf", &r);
  s = r * r * 3.141592653589;
  l = 3.141592653589 * (r + r);
  printf("%.8lf %.8lf\n", s, l);
}
```
