Step 1: Remove unnecessary header files
- The program only uses `cstdio` and `iostream` headers, so we can remove the `iostream` header as it is not being used.

Step 2: Remove unnecessary namespace
- The program is using the `using namespace std;` directive, which brings all names from the `std` namespace into the global namespace. This can lead to potential naming conflicts. Instead, we can use the `std::` prefix for specific names that we want to use from the `std` namespace.

Step 3: Use a more accurate value for PI
- The program currently uses the approximation `3.141592653589` for PI. We can use a more accurate value of PI from the `<cmath>` header, which provides the constant `M_PI`.

Step 4: Use `std::cout` instead of `printf`
- The program currently uses `printf` to print the output. We can use `std::cout` from the `iostream` header instead, which is the standard way of outputting in C++.

Step 5: Remove unnecessary return statement
- The program has a `return 0;` statement at the end, which is unnecessary for the `main` function. The compiler automatically inserts a `return 0;` statement at the end of the `main` function if it is missing.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <cstdio>
#include <cmath>

int main() {
  double PI = M_PI;
  double r;
  std::cin >> r;
  std::cout << PI * r * r << " " << 2 * PI * r << "\n";
}
```
