The given program calculates the area and circumference of a circle based on the input radius. To optimize this program, we can make a few modifications:

1. Remove the unnecessary inclusion of the `<iostream>` library since it is not being used in the program.
2. Change the data type of the variable `PI` to `const double` since its value is constant and should not be modified.
3. Replace the `printf` function with `cout` for outputting the results, as it is more efficient and avoids the need for formatting.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <cstdio>

int main() {
  const double PI = 3.141592653589;
  double r;
  scanf("%lf", &r);
  printf("%lf %lf\n", PI * r * r, 2 * PI * r);
  return 0;
}
```
