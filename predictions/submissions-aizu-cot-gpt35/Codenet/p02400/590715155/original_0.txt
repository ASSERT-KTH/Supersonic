To optimize the given program for running time and memory usage, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove the unnecessary inclusion of the `<iostream>` header since it is not being used in the program.

2. Replace the `printf` function with `cout` for output since we are already using `cin` for input.

3. Remove the `using namespace std;` line and use the `std::` prefix for the `cin` and `cout` objects.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <cstdio>

int main() {
  double PI = 3.141592653589;
  double r;
  std::cin >> r;
  std::cout << PI * r * r << " " << 2 * PI * r << "\n";
  return 0;
}
```
