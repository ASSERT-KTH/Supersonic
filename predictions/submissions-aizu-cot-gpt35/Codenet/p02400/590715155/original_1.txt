The given C++ program calculates the area and circumference of a circle based on the radius input by the user.

To optimize this program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary header files: The program includes `<iostream>` but does not use any functionality from it. We can remove this header file.

2. Remove the `using namespace std;` statement: This is a bad practice as it pollutes the global namespace. Instead, we can use the `std::` prefix for standard library functions.

3. Remove the unnecessary `return 0;` statement: In the `main()` function, returning 0 is not necessary as the compiler automatically inserts it if not specified.

4. Use the more precise `M_PI` constant: Instead of manually defining `PI` as an approximation, we can use the `M_PI` constant from the `cmath` library, which provides a more accurate value of Ï€.

5. Use `std::cout` instead of `printf()`: Since we have removed the unnecessary `<cstdio>` header, we can use `std::cout` for printing the output, which is the standard way in C++.

With these optimizations, the modified program would look like this:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>

int main() {
  double r;
  std::cin >> r;
  std::cout << (M_PI * r * r) << " " << (2 * M_PI * r) << "\n";
}
```
