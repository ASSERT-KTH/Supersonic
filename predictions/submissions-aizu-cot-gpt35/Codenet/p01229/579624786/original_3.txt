The given program uses a dynamic programming approach to solve a problem. It maintains a 3D boolean array `dp` to store the intermediate results. However, there are some optimizations that can be applied to improve the program's running time and memory usage.

1. Avoid using macros: The program uses macros (`#define`) to define constants and loops. Instead, we can use `const` variables and standard `for` loops, which are more readable and less error-prone.

2. Avoid using `using namespace std;`: The program uses `using namespace std;` which brings all the names from the `std` namespace into the global namespace. This can lead to naming conflicts and it's generally considered bad practice. We can qualify the names from the `std` namespace with `std::` instead.

3. Eliminate unnecessary initializations: The program initializes the `dp` array to `false` in each iteration of the outer loop. Since the array is already initialized to `false` at the beginning of the program, this step is unnecessary.

4. Avoid using variable-length arrays: The program uses a variable-length array `input[N]` to store the input values. Variable-length arrays are not part of standard C++, and their usage can lead to undefined behavior. We can use a `std::vector` instead, which provides a safe and flexible way to store a dynamic number of elements.

5. Simplify the logic for updating `dp` array: The program uses nested loops to iterate over all possible values of `L` and `M` to update the `dp` array. However, we can simplify this logic by eliminating the inner loop and using a conditional statement instead.

6. Remove unnecessary clearing of the `dp` array: After updating the `dp` array for each `cur` value, the program clears the array. Since the array is overwritten in the next iteration of the outer loop, this step is unnecessary.

7. Remove unnecessary use of `cur & 1`: The program uses `cur & 1` to index the `dp` array. However, since `cur` is always incremented by 1 in each iteration, we can replace `cur & 1` with `(cur + 1) % 2`.

Taking these optimizations into consideration, here's the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <cmath>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

const int MAX = 150;

int main() {
  int T;
  while (std::cin >> T) {
    while (T--) {
      int N;
      std::cin >> N;
      
      std::vector<int> input(N);
      for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
        std::cin >> input[i];
      }
      
      if (N <= 2) {
        std::cout << input[N - 1] << std::endl;
        continue;
      }
      
      int ans = input[N - 1];
      std::vector<std::vector<std::vector<bool>>> dp(MAX, std::vector<std::vector<bool>>(MAX, std::vector<bool>(2, false)));
      
      for (int cur = 1; cur < N - 1; cur++) {
        dp[input[cur - 1]][input[cur]][(cur + 1) % 2] = true;
        int R = input[cur + 1];
        
        for (int L = 0; L < MAX; L++) {
          for (int M = 0; M < MAX; M++) {
            if (!dp[L][M][(cur + 1) % 2])
              continue;
            
            if (M == 0) {
              if (cur + 2 < N) {
                dp[M][R][(cur + 1) % 2] = true;
              } else {
                ans = std::max(ans, R);
              }
            } else {
              if (cur + 2 < N) {
                dp[M][R][(cur + 1) % 2] = true;
                dp[M - 1][R + L][(cur + 1) % 2] = true;
              } else {
                ans = std::max(ans, R + L);
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
      
      std::cout << ans << std::endl;
    }
  }
  
  return 0;
}
```

These optimizations should improve the running time and memory usage of the program while maintaining the same functionality.
