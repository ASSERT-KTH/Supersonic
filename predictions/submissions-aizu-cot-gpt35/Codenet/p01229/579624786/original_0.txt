Step 1: Remove unnecessary headers
- The program includes the `<algorithm>` and `<cmath>` headers, but it does not use any functions from these headers. We can remove these headers to improve compilation time and reduce memory usage.

Step 2: Remove unnecessary macros
- The program defines macros `REP`, `rep`, `inf`, and `MAX`, but these macros are not used in the program. We can remove these macros to simplify the code.

Step 3: Reduce memory usage
- The program uses a 3-dimensional array `dp[MAX][MAX][2]` to store intermediate results. However, the maximum value of `MAX` is 150, which leads to a large memory usage. We can reduce the memory usage by using a 2-dimensional array with size `N` instead, where `N` is the input size.

Step 4: Optimize the inner loop
- The inner loop iterates over all possible values of `L` and `M`. However, since `L` and `M` are in the range of `MAX`, which is 150, there are many unnecessary iterations. We can optimize the loop by only iterating over the non-zero values of `L` and `M`.

Step 5: Optimize the condition checks
- The condition checks `if (cur + 2 < N)` and `if (M == 0)` are performed inside the inner loop, which can be computationally expensive. We can optimize these condition checks by moving them outside the loop.

Step 6: Avoid unnecessary assignments
- The assignment `dp[i][j][cur & 1] = false` is performed at the end of each iteration of the outer loop. However, this assignment is unnecessary because the values will be overwritten in the next iteration. We can remove this assignment to improve performance.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

int main() {
  int T;
  while (cin >> T) {
    while (T--) {
      int N;
      cin >> N;
      vector<int> input(N);
      for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
        cin >> input[i];
      }
      if (N <= 2) {
        cout << input[N - 1] << endl;
        continue;
      }
      int ans = input[N - 1];
      vector<vector<bool>> dp(N, vector<bool>(N));
      for (int cur = 1; cur < N - 1; cur++) {
        dp[input[cur - 1]][input[cur]] = true;
        int R = input[cur + 1];
        for (int L = 1; L < N; L++) {
          for (int M = 1; M < N; M++) {
            if (!dp[L][M]) {
              continue;
            }
            if (M == 1) {
              if (cur + 2 < N) {
                dp[M][R] = true;
              } else {
                ans = max(ans, R);
              }
            } else {
              if (cur + 2 < N) {
                dp[M][R] = true;
                dp[M - 1][R + L] = true;
              } else {
                ans = max(ans, R + L);
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
      cout << ans << endl;
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```
