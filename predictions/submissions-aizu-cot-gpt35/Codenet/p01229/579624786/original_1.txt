The given program can be optimized in the following steps:

1. Remove unnecessary header files: The program includes `<algorithm>`, `<cmath>`, and `<vector>` header files, but these are not used in the program. We can remove them to improve compile time and reduce memory usage.

2. Replace macros with inline functions: The program uses macros `REP` and `rep` for loops. We can replace these macros with inline functions to avoid potential issues with macros and improve code readability.

3. Remove unnecessary assignments: In each test case, the program initializes the `dp` array with `false` values using nested loops. However, this is not necessary as the array will be overwritten in the subsequent logic. We can remove these unnecessary assignments to improve runtime.

4. Use a fixed-size array instead of a variable-length array: The program uses a variable-length array `int input[N]` to store the input values. Variable-length arrays can have performance implications. Since the maximum value of `N` is defined as `MAX` (150), we can use a fixed-size array of size `MAX` instead to avoid variable-length array overhead.

5. Optimize nested loops: The program uses nested loops to iterate over the `dp` array. We can optimize these nested loops by using a single loop with a linear index calculation.

6. Avoid unnecessary calculations: The program uses the bitwise AND operator to check if `cur` is odd (`cur & 1`). Instead, we can use the modulo operator (`cur % 2`) to achieve the same result with potentially better performance.

7. Avoid redundant assignments: After each iteration of the outer loop, the program resets the `dp` array to `false` using nested loops. However, this is not necessary as the `dp` array will be fully overwritten in the subsequent iterations. We can remove these redundant assignments to improve runtime.

Here is the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#define MAX 150

inline void REP(int& i, int s, int n) {
  for (i = s; i < n; i++)
    ;
}

inline void rep(int& i, int n) {
  REP(i, 0, n)
    ;
}

int main() {
  int T;
  while (std::cin >> T) {
    while (T--) {
      int dp[MAX][MAX][2] = {0};
      int N;
      std::cin >> N;
      int input[MAX];
      rep(int i, N) std::cin >> input[i];
      if (N <= 2) {
        std::cout << input[N - 1] << std::endl;
        continue;
      }
      int ans = input[N - 1];
      REP(int cur, 1, N - 1) {
        dp[input[cur - 1]][input[cur]][cur % 2] = true;
        int R = input[cur + 1];
        rep(int index, MAX * MAX * 2) {
          int L = index / (MAX * 2);
          int M = (index % (MAX * 2)) / 2;
          if (!dp[L][M][cur % 2])
            continue;
          if (M == 0) {
            if (cur + 2 < N) {
              dp[M][R][(cur + 1) % 2] = true;
            } else
              ans = std::max(ans, R);
          } else {
            if (cur + 2 < N) {
              dp[M][R][(cur + 1) % 2] = true;
              dp[M - 1][R + L][(cur + 1) % 2] = true;
            } else {
              ans = std::max(ans, R + L);
            }
          }
        }
      }
      std::cout << ans << std::endl;
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Explanation of optimization steps:

1. Removed unnecessary header files `<algorithm>`, `<cmath>`, and `<vector>`.

2. Replaced macros `REP` and `rep` with inline functions.

3. Removed unnecessary assignments when initializing `dp` array.

4. Replaced the variable-length array `int input[N]` with a fixed-size array `int input[MAX]`.

5. Optimized nested loops by using a single loop with a linear index calculation.

6. Replaced `cur & 1` with `cur % 2` to check if `cur` is odd.

7. Removed redundant assignments that reset the `dp` array after each iteration of the outer loop.
