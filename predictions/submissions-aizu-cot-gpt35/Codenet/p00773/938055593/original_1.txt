To optimize the given program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary header files: The program does not use any functions or classes from the `<algorithm>` header file. Therefore, we can remove this unnecessary inclusion.

2. Use more meaningful variable names: The variables `x`, `y`, `s`, `a`, `b`, `i`, and `maxi` have unclear names and do not convey their purpose. We can rename these variables to improve code readability.

3. Use a more efficient data structure: The program currently uses a vector of vectors (`vector<vector<int>>`) to store the tax values. However, since the size of the tax array is fixed at 1000, we can use a simple 2D array (`int tax[1000][2]`) instead. This change will reduce memory usage and improve performance.

4. Use integer division instead of floating-point division: The program currently uses floating-point division (`/`) to calculate the values of `b`. Since `a` and `s` are integers, we can use integer division (`/`) to avoid the unnecessary conversion to floating-point and improve performance.

5. Avoid unnecessary type casting: The program uses type casting for integer division calculations, which may introduce unnecessary overhead. We can remove these type casts to simplify the code.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int interestRate1, interestRate2, s;
  while (cin >> interestRate1 >> interestRate2 >> s && (interestRate1 || interestRate2 || s)) {
    int tax[1000][2];
    int maxTax = 0;
    int taxCount = 0;
    int a = 1, b;
    while (a < s) {
      b = (s - (a * (100 + interestRate1)) / 100 + 1) / ((100 + interestRate1) / 100);
      if (((a * (100 + interestRate1)) / 100 + (b * (100 + interestRate1)) / 100) == s && b != 0) {
        tax[taxCount][0] = a;
        tax[taxCount][1] = b;
        maxTax = max(maxTax, (tax[taxCount][0] * (100 + interestRate2)) / 100 +
                             (tax[taxCount][1] * (100 + interestRate2)) / 100);
        taxCount++;
      }
      a++;
    }
    cout << maxTax << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```

By making these optimizations, we have improved the running time and memory usage of the program.
