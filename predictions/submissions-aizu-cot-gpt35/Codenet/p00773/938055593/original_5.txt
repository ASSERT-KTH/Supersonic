Optimization steps:
1. Remove unnecessary headers: The program includes the `<algorithm>` header, but it is not used in the code. We can remove this header since it is not needed.
2. Avoid unnecessary calculations: The original program uses floating-point arithmetic to calculate `b`, but we can use integer arithmetic instead. This will avoid the need for casting and improve performance.
3. Avoid unnecessary memory allocation: The original program initializes a vector `tax` with a fixed size of 1000, but only a portion of it is used. We can optimize memory usage by initializing the vector with the exact size needed based on the input values of `x`, `y`, and `s`.
4. Use more descriptive variable names: The variable names `a`, `b`, `i`, and `maxi` are not very descriptive. We can use more meaningful names to improve code readability.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int x, y, s;
  while (cin >> x >> y >> s && (x || y || s)) {
    vector<vector<int>> tax(s + 1, vector<int>(2));
    int maxTax = 0, index = 0, a = 1, b;
    while (a < s) {
      b = (s - (a * (100 + x)) / 100 + 1) / ((100 + x) / 100);
      if (((a * (100 + x)) / 100 + (b * (100 + x)) / 100) == s && b != 0) {
        tax[index][0] = a;
        tax[index][1] = b;
        maxTax = max(maxTax, (tax[index][0] * (100 + y)) / 100 +
                                 (tax[index][1] * (100 + y)) / 100);
        index++;
      }
      a++;
    }
    cout << maxTax << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```
