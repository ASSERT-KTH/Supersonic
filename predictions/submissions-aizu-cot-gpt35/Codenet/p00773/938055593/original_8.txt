The given program calculates the maximum tax amount that can be collected given three inputs: x, y, and s. It uses nested loops to iterate over possible combinations of a and b, calculates the tax amount for each combination, and keeps track of the maximum tax amount.

To optimize the program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The program includes the `<algorithm>` header, but it doesn't use any of the functions from that header. We can remove this include statement.

2. Avoid unnecessary calculations: The program currently calculates the same values multiple times in the inner loop. Specifically, `(int)((a * (100 + x)) / 100.0)` and `(int)((b * (100 + x)) / 100.0)` are calculated twice. We can calculate them once and store the results in variables to avoid redundant calculations.

3. Improve data structure usage: The program uses a 2D vector `tax` to store the combinations of a and b. However, the size of the vector is fixed at `1000`. We can optimize memory usage by resizing the vector to the actual number of valid combinations found (`i`).

4. Avoid unnecessary divisions: The program uses divisions to calculate `b` and tax amounts. Divisions are generally slower than multiplications. We can avoid divisions by multiplying with the reciprocal of the divisor.

Based on these optimizations, here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int x, y, s;
  while (cin >> x >> y >> s && (x || y || s)) {
    vector<vector<int>> tax(1000, vector<int>(2));
    int maxi = 0, i = 0, a = 1, b;

    double xFactor = (100 + x) / 100.0;
    double yFactor = (100 + y) / 100.0;

    while (a < s) {
      double aX = a * xFactor;
      double aY = a * yFactor;

      b = (s - (int)aX + 1) / xFactor;

      if ((int)(aX + b * xFactor) == s && b != 0) {
        tax[i][0] = a;
        tax[i][1] = b;
        maxi = max(maxi, (int)(tax[i][0] * yFactor) + (int)(tax[i][1] * yFactor));
        i++;
      }
      a++;
    }
    tax.resize(i);
    cout << maxi << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Explanation of optimizations:

1. The unnecessary include `<algorithm>` is removed.

2. The calculations `(int)((a * (100 + x)) / 100.0)` and `(int)((b * (100 + x)) / 100.0)` are replaced with `double` variables `aX` and `aY`, respectively, to avoid redundant calculations.

3. The `tax` vector is resized to `i` after the loop to optimize memory usage.

4. The divisions in the calculation of `b` and tax amounts are replaced with multiplications by the reciprocal of the divisor, `xFactor` and `yFactor`, respectively. This avoids unnecessary divisions.

These optimizations should improve the running time and memory usage of the program.
