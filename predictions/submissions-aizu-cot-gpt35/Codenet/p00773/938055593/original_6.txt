This program calculates the maximum tax revenue based on two tax rates (x and y) and a target tax revenue (s). The program uses a brute force approach to find all possible combinations of tax rates that result in the target tax revenue and calculates the maximum revenue among those combinations.

To optimize this program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The `<algorithm>` header is not used in the program, so we can remove it.

2. Avoid unnecessary calculations: The program uses floating-point division and multiplication to calculate the tax rates. We can avoid these calculations by using integer division and multiplication.

3. Optimize the loop condition: The loop condition `while (a < s)` can be modified to `while (a <= s / 2)` to reduce the number of iterations. This is because if `a` is greater than `s / 2`, then the corresponding `b` value will be less than 0, which is not valid.

4. Avoid unnecessary vector initialization: The vector `tax` is initialized with zeros at the beginning of each iteration of the outer loop. We can avoid this initialization by reusing the same vector for each iteration and only updating the necessary elements.

5. Optimize the calculation of `maxi`: The calculation of `maxi` can be optimized by avoiding unnecessary floating-point division and multiplication. Instead, we can directly calculate the sum of tax revenues using integer division and multiplication.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int x, y, s;
  while (cin >> x >> y >> s && (x || y || s)) {
    vector<vector<int>> tax(1, vector<int>(2));
    int maxi = 0, i = 0, a = 1, b;
    while (a <= s / 2) {
      b = (s - a * (100 + x) / 100) * 100 / (100 + x);
      if (a * (100 + x) + b * (100 + x) == s * 100 && b != 0) {
        if (i >= tax.size()) {
          tax.push_back(vector<int>(2));
        }
        tax[i][0] = a;
        tax[i][1] = b;
        maxi = max(maxi, tax[i][0] * (100 + y) + tax[i][1] * (100 + y));
        i++;
      }
      a++;
    }
    cout << maxi << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Explanation of optimizations:

1. Removed unnecessary includes: The `<algorithm>` header was not used in the program, so it was removed.

2. Avoided unnecessary calculations: Replaced floating-point division and multiplication with integer division and multiplication in the calculations of tax rates.

3. Optimized the loop condition: Modified the loop condition from `while (a < s)` to `while (a <= s / 2)` to reduce the number of iterations.

4. Avoided unnecessary vector initialization: Instead of initializing the `tax` vector with zeros at the beginning of each iteration, we reused the same vector and only updated the necessary elements.

5. Optimized the calculation of `maxi`: Replaced floating-point division and multiplication with integer division and multiplication in the calculation of `maxi`.
