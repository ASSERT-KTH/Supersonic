The given program calculates the maximum tax that can be collected for a given set of variables x, y, and s. It uses a nested loop to iterate through all possible combinations of a and b, and calculates the tax for each combination. The maximum tax is stored in the variable "maxi" and printed at the end.

To optimize the program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The program includes the <algorithm> header, which is not used. We can remove this include statement.

2. Use more descriptive variable names: The variable names x, y, and s are not very descriptive. We can rename them to "taxRate1", "taxRate2", and "totalTax" respectively, to make the code more readable.

3. Change the vector initialization: The program initializes a two-dimensional vector "tax" with a fixed size of 1000 rows and 2 columns. However, the actual number of rows required depends on the input values. We can change the initialization to use a dynamic size based on the number of valid combinations, which will reduce memory usage.

4. Avoid unnecessary floating-point calculations: The program uses floating-point calculations to calculate the tax for each combination. Since the tax rates are given as percentages, we can avoid floating-point calculations and use integer arithmetic instead, which will be faster.

5. Optimize the loop conditions: The outer loop iterates over the variable "a" from 1 to "totalTax". However, we can optimize this loop by changing the condition to "a <= totalTax/2". This is because "b" can never be greater than "totalTax/2" in order for the condition to be true.

6. Remove unnecessary condition check: The condition check "(x || y || s)" in the while loop is unnecessary. The loop will exit when any of the variables becomes zero, so we can remove this condition check.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int taxRate1, taxRate2, totalTax;
  while (cin >> taxRate1 >> taxRate2 >> totalTax) {
    if (totalTax == 0) {
      break;
    }
    
    vector<vector<int>> tax;
    int maxi = 0, i = 0, a = 1, b;
    while (a <= totalTax / 2) {
      b = (totalTax - (a * (100 + taxRate1)) / 100 + 1) * 100 / (100 + taxRate1);
      if ((a * (100 + taxRate1) + b * (100 + taxRate1)) == totalTax * 100 && b != 0) {
        tax.push_back({a, b});
        maxi = max(maxi, (tax[i][0] * (100 + taxRate2) + tax[i][1] * (100 + taxRate2)) / 100);
        i++;
      }
      a++;
    }
    cout << maxi << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```
