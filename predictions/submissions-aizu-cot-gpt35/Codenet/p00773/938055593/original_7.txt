The given program is a brute-force solution to a problem. It calculates the maximum tax amount based on two tax rates (x and y) for a given sum (s). The program loops through all possible combinations of tax amounts (a and b) and checks if the sum equals the given value (s). If it does, it calculates the maximum tax amount based on the given tax rates and updates the maximum value if necessary.

To optimize this program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The program includes the <algorithm> header, but it doesn't use any functions from it. Therefore, we can remove this include statement.

2. Remove the unnecessary use of the vector: The program uses a vector of vectors to store the tax amounts (a and b) for each combination. However, we only need to keep track of the maximum tax amount, so we can remove the vector and update the maximum value directly.

3. Remove unnecessary calculations: The program performs several unnecessary calculations, such as division and multiplication by 100. We can simplify these calculations to improve performance.

4. Use more descriptive variable names: The variable names used in the program are not very descriptive. We can use more meaningful names to improve code readability.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int tax_x, tax_y, sum;
  while (cin >> tax_x >> tax_y >> sum && (tax_x || tax_y || sum)) {
    int max_tax = 0;
    for (int a = 1; a < sum; a++) {
      int b = (sum - (a * (100 + tax_x) / 100)) * 100 / (100 + tax_x);
      if ((a * (100 + tax_x) + b * (100 + tax_x)) == sum * (100 + tax_x) &&
          b != 0) {
        int tax_amount = (a * (100 + tax_y) + b * (100 + tax_y)) / 100;
        max_tax = max(max_tax, tax_amount);
      }
    }
    cout << max_tax << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```

In the optimized program, we removed the unnecessary vector and replaced it with a single variable to store the maximum tax amount. We simplified the calculations by removing unnecessary divisions and multiplications by 100. We also used more descriptive variable names to improve code readability.
