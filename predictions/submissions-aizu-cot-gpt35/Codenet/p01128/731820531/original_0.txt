To optimize the given program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary include statements: The program includes many unnecessary header files that are not used in the code. We can remove them to reduce the compile time and memory usage.

2. Remove unnecessary typedefs and functions: The program defines many typedefs and functions that are not used in the code. We can remove them to simplify the code and improve readability.

3. Remove unnecessary output operators: The program defines output operators for various data structures, but they are not used in the code. We can remove them to reduce the compile time and memory usage.

4. Remove unnecessary libraries: The program includes many unnecessary libraries that are not used in the code. We can remove them to reduce the compile time and memory usage.

5. Combine multiple lines into one: The program uses multiple lines to define the same variable or perform the same operation. We can combine them into a single line to reduce the number of lines and improve readability.

With these modifications, the optimized C++ program looks like this:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <complex>

using namespace std;

typedef complex<double> Point;
typedef pair<Point, bool> P;

bool intersect_SS(const Point& p1, const Point& p2, const Point& q1, const Point& q2) {
    double d1 = cross(q1 - p1, p2 - p1);
    double d2 = cross(q2 - p1, p2 - p1);
    double d3 = cross(p1 - q1, q2 - q1);
    double d4 = cross(p2 - q1, q2 - q1);
    return (d1 * d2 < 0) && (d3 * d4 < 0);
}

int main() {
    ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(0);

    int T;
    cin >> T;
    while (T--) {
        Point p1, p2;
        cin >> p1 >> p2;
        vector<P> c;
        int n;
        cin >> n;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            Point q1, q2;
            int o, l;
            cin >> q1 >> q2 >> o >> l;
            if (intersect_SS(p1, p2, q1, q2))
                c.push_back(make_pair((p1 + p2) / 2.0, (o ^ l)));
        }
        sort(c.begin(), c.end());
        int res = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < (int)c.size() - 1; ++i) {
            if (c[i].second != c[i + 1].second)
                ++res;
        }
        cout << res << endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

These modifications optimize the program by removing unnecessary code and simplifying the logic. The optimized program should have improved running time and reduced memory usage.
