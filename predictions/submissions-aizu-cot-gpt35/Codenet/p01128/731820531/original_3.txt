To optimize the given program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary header files: The program includes many unnecessary header files such as `<algorithm>`, `<bitset>`, `<cassert>`, `<cfloat>`, etc. We can remove these header files to reduce the compilation time and memory usage.

2. Remove unnecessary macros: The program defines many unnecessary macros such as `rep`, `foreach`, `rforeach`, etc. These macros are not used in the program and can be safely removed.

3. Remove unused functions: The program defines many unused functions such as `uniq`, `to_s`, `to_T`, `print_container`, etc. We can remove these functions to reduce the memory usage.

4. Remove unused typedefs: The program defines many unused typedefs such as `pint`, `Convex`, `Circle`, etc. We can remove these typedefs to reduce the memory usage.

5. Remove unused operators overloading: The program overloads many operators such as `<<` for various data types. These overloaded operators are not used in the program and can be safely removed.

6. Remove unused helper functions: The program defines many unused helper functions such as `is_orthogonal`, `is_parallel`, `intersect_LP`, `intersect_SP`, etc. We can remove these functions to reduce the memory usage.

7. Remove unused geometric calculations: The program performs many unnecessary geometric calculations such as `dist_LP`, `dist_PL`, `dist_LL`, `dist_LS`, etc. These calculations are not needed in the program and can be safely removed.

8. Remove unused input/output functions: The program defines many unused input/output functions such as `print`, `print2d`, `input`, etc. We can remove these functions to reduce the memory usage.

9. Remove unused constants: The program defines many unused constants such as `dx`, `dy`, `PI`, etc. We can remove these constants to reduce the memory usage.

10. Remove unused variables: The program defines many unused variables such as `Seg s`, `Point rota`, `int res`, etc. We can remove these variables to reduce the memory usage.

Based on these optimizations, the optimized program is as follows:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

typedef std::pair<int, int> Point;
typedef std::pair<Point, bool> Intersection;

bool intersect_SS(const Point& p1, const Point& p2, const Point& p3, const Point& p4) {
    int d1 = (p3.first - p1.first) * (p2.second - p1.second) - (p3.second - p1.second) * (p2.first - p1.first);
    int d2 = (p4.first - p1.first) * (p2.second - p1.second) - (p4.second - p1.second) * (p2.first - p1.first);
    int d3 = (p1.first - p3.first) * (p4.second - p3.second) - (p1.second - p3.second) * (p4.first - p3.first);
    int d4 = (p2.first - p3.first) * (p4.second - p3.second) - (p2.second - p3.second) * (p4.first - p3.first);
    return (d1 * d2 < 0) && (d3 * d4 < 0);
}

int main() {
    std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
    std::cin.tie(0);
    
    int T;
    std::cin >> T;
    while (T--) {
        Point s1, s2;
        std::cin >> s1.first >> s1.second >> s2.first >> s2.second;
        
        int n;
        std::cin >> n;
        
        std::vector<Intersection> intersections;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            Point t1, t2;
            int o, l;
            std::cin >> t1.first >> t1.second >> t2.first >> t2.second >> o >> l;
            if (intersect_SS(s1, s2, t1, t2)) {
                intersections.push_back(std::
