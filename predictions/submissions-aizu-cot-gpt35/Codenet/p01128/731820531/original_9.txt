To optimize the given program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The program includes several unnecessary headers such as `<algorithm>`, `<bitset>`, `<cassert>`, etc. We can remove these includes to reduce the size of the compiled program.

2. Remove unused macros: The program defines several macros such as `rep`, `ten`, `erep`, etc. These macros are not used in the program and can be safely removed.

3. Remove unused functions: The program defines several unused functions such as `uniq`, `to_s`, `to_T`, etc. We can remove these functions to reduce the size of the compiled program.

4. Remove unused typedefs: The program defines several unused typedefs such as `pint`, `Convex`, `Circle`, etc. We can remove these typedefs to reduce the size of the compiled program.

5. Remove unused operators overloading: The program overloads several operators such as `<<` for containers and `<<` for `Point`. These overloaded operators are not used in the program and can be safely removed.

6. Remove unused classes: The program defines several unused classes such as `Line` and `Circle`. We can remove these classes to reduce the size of the compiled program.

7. Remove unused utility functions: The program defines several utility functions such as `dot`, `cross`, `ccw`, etc. These utility functions are not used in the program and can be safely removed.

8. Remove unnecessary checks and error handling: The program contains several unnecessary checks and error handling statements such as checking for parallel lines, handling same line cases, etc. We can remove these checks and error handling statements to simplify the code and improve performance.

9. Remove unnecessary sorting: The program sorts the `c` vector unnecessarily. Since the vector is not used for any other purpose, we can remove the sorting step to improve performance.

10. Avoid unnecessary calculations: The program performs unnecessary calculations such as multiplying points by `rota` and computing the angle of a line. We can avoid these unnecessary calculations to improve performance.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

struct Point {
    double x, y;
};

struct Segment {
    Point start, end;
};

bool intersect(const Segment& s1, const Segment& s2) {
    double d1 = (s1.end.x - s1.start.x) * (s2.start.y - s1.start.y) - (s1.end.y - s1.start.y) * (s2.start.x - s1.start.x);
    double d2 = (s1.end.x - s1.start.x) * (s2.end.y - s1.start.y) - (s1.end.y - s1.start.y) * (s2.end.x - s1.start.x);
    double d3 = (s2.end.x - s2.start.x) * (s1.start.y - s2.start.y) - (s2.end.y - s2.start.y) * (s1.start.x - s2.start.x);
    double d4 = (s2.end.x - s2.start.x) * (s1.end.y - s2.start.y) - (s2.end.y - s2.start.y) * (s1.end.x - s2.start.x);
    return (d1 * d2 < 0) && (d3 * d4 < 0);
}

int main() {
    cin.tie(0);
    ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
    
    int T;
    cin >> T;
    
    while (T--) {
        Segment s;
        cin >> s.start.x >> s.start.y >> s.end.x >> s.end.y;
        
        int n;
        cin >> n;
        
        int res = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            Segment t;
            int o, l;
            cin >> t.start.x >> t.start.y >> t.end.x >> t.end.y >> o >> l;
            
            if (intersect(s, t)) {
                if (o ^ l) {
                    res++;
                }
            }
        }
        
        cout << res << endl;
    }
    
    return
