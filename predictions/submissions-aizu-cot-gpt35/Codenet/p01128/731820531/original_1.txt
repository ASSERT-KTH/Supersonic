To optimize the given C++ program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary header files: The program includes many unnecessary header files. We can remove them to reduce the compilation time and memory usage.

2. Remove unused macros: There are several macros defined in the program that are not used. We can remove them to simplify the code.

3. Remove unnecessary typedefs: The program defines several typedefs that are not used. We can remove them to simplify the code.

4. Remove unnecessary functions: The program defines several functions that are not used. We can remove them to simplify the code.

5. Remove unnecessary operators overloading: The program overloads several operators for printing containers and geometric objects. These overloaded operators are not used in the program. We can remove them to simplify the code.

6. Remove unnecessary code in main() function: The main() function contains some unnecessary code for handling geometric calculations. Since the program does not use these calculations, we can remove them to simplify the code.

Here is the optimized C++ program:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

struct Point {
  double x, y;
};

struct Line {
  Point first, second;
};

bool intersect_SS(const Line &seg1, const Line &seg2) {
  double x1 = seg1.first.x, y1 = seg1.first.y;
  double x2 = seg1.second.x, y2 = seg1.second.y;
  double x3 = seg2.first.x, y3 = seg2.first.y;
  double x4 = seg2.second.x, y4 = seg2.second.y;

  double d1 = (x1 - x2) * (y3 - y1) + (y1 - y2) * (x1 - x3);
  double d2 = (x1 - x2) * (y4 - y1) + (y1 - y2) * (x1 - x4);
  double d3 = (x3 - x4) * (y1 - y3) + (y3 - y4) * (x3 - x1);
  double d4 = (x3 - x4) * (y2 - y3) + (y3 - y4) * (x3 - x2);

  return (d1 * d2 < 0) && (d3 * d4 < 0);
}

int main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(nullptr);

  int T;
  cin >> T;
  while (T--) {
    Line s;
    cin >> s.first.x >> s.first.y >> s.second.x >> s.second.y;

    vector<pair<Point, bool>> c;
    int n;
    cin >> n;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
      Line t;
      int o, l;
      cin >> t.first.x >> t.first.y >> t.second.x >> t.second.y >> o >> l;

      if (intersect_SS(s, t)) {
        Point ip;
        ip.x = (t.first.x + t.second.x) / 2;
        ip.y = (t.first.y + t.second.y) / 2;
        c.push_back(make_pair(ip, (o ^ l)));
      }
    }

    sort(c.begin(), c.end());
    int res = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < c.size() - 1; ++i) {
      if (c[i].second != c[i + 1].second) {
        ++res;
      }
    }

    cout << res << '\n';
  }

  return 0;
}
```

Explanation of the optimization steps:

1. Removed unnecessary header files: The program originally included many unnecessary header files. These header files are not used in the optimized program, so they were removed.

2. Removed unused macros: The program originally defined several macros that were not used. These macros were removed to simplify the code.

3. Removed unnecessary typedefs: The program originally defined several typedefs that were not used. These typedefs were removed to simplify the code.

4. Removed unnecessary functions: The program originally defined several functions that were not used
