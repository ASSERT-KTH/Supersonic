The given program takes an input number from the user, checks if it is between 0 and 100 (inclusive), and then computes the cube of the number using a for loop. The result is then printed.

To optimize the program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove the unnecessary `using namespace std;` statement.
2. Remove the `void` parameter from the `cubedNum` function since it does not take any arguments.
3. Move the initialization of `inputNum` and `result` inside the while loop to avoid unnecessary initialization.
4. Instead of using a while loop to repeatedly ask for input until a valid number is entered, we can use a do-while loop which guarantees at least one execution of the loop body.
5. Instead of using a for loop to compute the cube of the number, we can directly multiply `inputNum` with itself three times to achieve the same result.
6. Remove the `return` statement from the `cubedNum` function since it is not needed.
7. Instead of using `endl` to print a newline character, we can use `"\n"` which is more efficient.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

void cubedNum() {
  int inputNum;
  int result = 1;
  do {
    std::cin >> inputNum;
  } while (inputNum < 0 || inputNum > 100);
  result = inputNum * inputNum * inputNum;
  std::cout << result << "\n";
}

int main() {
  cubedNum();
  return 0;
}
```
