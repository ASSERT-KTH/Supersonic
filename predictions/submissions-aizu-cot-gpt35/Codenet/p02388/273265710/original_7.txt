The given program reads an input number from the user and calculates the cube of that number. The cube is calculated by multiplying the input number by itself three times.

To optimize this program, we can make the following changes:

1. Remove the unnecessary `using namespace std;` statement.

2. Remove the unused `void` parameter from the `cubedNum` function.

3. Instead of using a `while` loop to validate the input number, we can use a `do-while` loop to ensure that the input number is within the valid range (0 to 100).

4. Instead of calculating the cube by multiplying the input number three times, we can use the `pow` function from the `<cmath>` library to calculate the cube directly.

5. We can remove the `return` statement from the `cubedNum` function as it is not needed.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>

void cubedNum() {
  int inputNum;
  do {
    std::cin >> inputNum;
  } while (inputNum < 0 || inputNum > 100);

  int result = std::pow(inputNum, 3);
  std::cout << result << std::endl;
}

int main() {
  cubedNum();
  return 0;
}
```
