The given program reads an integer input from the user, checks if it is within the range of 0 to 100, and then calculates the cube of the input number using a loop. The result is then printed to the console.

To optimize this program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove the unnecessary `using namespace std;` statement. It is generally considered bad practice to use the entire `std` namespace.

2. Instead of using a `while` loop to repeatedly read the input until a valid number is entered, we can use a `do-while` loop. This way, we can avoid evaluating the condition twice.

3. Instead of using a `for` loop to calculate the cube of the input number, we can directly multiply the input number by itself three times.

4. Remove the `return` statement from the `cubedNum` function. It is not necessary as the function has a `void` return type.

Here is the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

void cubedNum() {
  int inputNum;
  int result = 1;
  
  do {
    std::cin >> inputNum;
  } while (inputNum < 0 || inputNum > 100);
  
  result = inputNum * inputNum * inputNum;
  
  std::cout << result << std::endl;
}

int main() {
  cubedNum();
  return 0;
}
```
