The given program is quite simple and does not require any complex optimization techniques. However, we can make a small modification to improve its performance.

The `scanf` function is used to read input from the user, but it can be slow in some cases. In this program, we only need to read a single integer from the user, so we can use `fgets` instead of `scanf` to read a line of input and then convert it to an integer using `sscanf`.

By using `fgets` and `sscanf`, we can reduce the number of system calls and improve the program's performance.

Here is the optimized program:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
  char input[10]; // Assuming the input number has at most 10 digits
  fgets(input, sizeof(input), stdin);
  int x;
  sscanf(input, "%d", &x);
  printf("%d\n", x * x * x);
  return 0;
}
```

In this optimized version, we declare a character array `input` to store the user's input. We use `fgets` to read a line of input from the user and store it in `input`. The `sizeof(input)` argument ensures that we read at most `sizeof(input)` characters from the input stream.

Then, we use `sscanf` to convert the input string stored in `input` to an integer and store it in the variable `x`. Finally, we calculate `x * x * x` and print the result using `printf`.
