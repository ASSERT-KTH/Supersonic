The given program reads an integer from the user, calculates its cube, and prints the result. 

To optimize this program, we can eliminate unnecessary calculations and reduce memory usage by using only a single variable instead of three.

Here are the optimization steps:

1. Remove the unused variable `x` from the program.

2. Instead of using three multiplications (`x * x * x`), use a single multiplication by storing the result of `x * x` in a separate variable.

3. Modify the `printf` statement to print the new variable instead of `x * x * x`.

Here is the optimized program:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
  int x;
  scanf("%d", &x);
  int cube = x * x;
  printf("%d\n", cube * x);
  return 0;
}
```
