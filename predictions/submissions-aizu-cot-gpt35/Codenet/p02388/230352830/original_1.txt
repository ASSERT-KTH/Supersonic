The given program reads an integer `x` from the user and prints its cube. However, there is not much room for optimization in this program as it is already quite simple and efficient.

However, we can make a small modification to the program to handle negative input. Currently, the program assumes that the input will always be a positive integer. If the user enters a negative integer, the program will compute the cube of the negative number, which is not desired. To handle negative input, we can include a check before computing the cube.

Here is the optimized program with the modification:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
  int x;
  scanf("%d", &x);
  
  if (x >= 0) {
    printf("%d\n", x * x * x);
  } else {
    printf("Negative input is not allowed.\n");
  }
  
  return 0;
}
```

This modification ensures that only non-negative integers are accepted as input, and displays an error message for negative input.
