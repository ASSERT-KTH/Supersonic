The given program reads an integer from the user, calculates its cube, and prints the result.

To optimize this program, we can eliminate unnecessary variable declarations and reduce the number of function calls.

Here are the step-by-step optimizations:

1. Remove the unnecessary variable declaration for `x`. Instead, declare it inside the `scanf` function call.
2. Remove the unnecessary variable declaration for `result`. Instead, calculate the cube directly inside the `printf` function call.
3. Eliminate the newline character (`\n`) in the `printf` format string and use a space character instead. This will reduce the number of characters printed.

Here is the optimized program:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
  printf("%d", (scanf("%d", &(int){0})) * (scanf("%d", &(int){0})) * (scanf("%d", &(int){0})));
  return 0;
}
```
