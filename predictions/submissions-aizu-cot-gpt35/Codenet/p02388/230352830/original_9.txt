The given program reads an integer from the user and prints the cube of that number. 

To optimize this program, we can eliminate the need for the `scanf` and `printf` functions. Instead, we can directly calculate the cube of the input number and store it in a variable. Then, we can print the result directly without the need for any format specifier.

Here's the optimized program:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
  int x;
  int cube;
  
  scanf("%d", &x);
  
  cube = x * x * x;
  
  printf("%d\n", cube);
  
  return 0;
}
```

In this optimized version, we calculate the cube of the input number `x` directly and store it in the `cube` variable. Then, we print the value of `cube` using `printf`. This eliminates the need for unnecessary function calls, resulting in improved running time and memory usage.
