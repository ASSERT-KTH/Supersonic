To optimize the given program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove the unnecessary include statement for `<stdio.h>`. Since we only use `scanf` and `printf` functions, we don't need the entire `<stdio.h>` library.

2. Instead of using `scanf` to read the input, we can use command-line arguments to pass the input value directly to the program. This will eliminate the need for user input during runtime.

3. We can remove the `return 0;` statement at the end of the `main` function since it is not necessary in C99 and later versions.

Here is the optimized version of the program:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
  int x = atoi(argv[1]);
  printf("%d\n", x * x * x);
}
```
