Explanation of optimization steps:

1. The original program is already quite efficient, as it only performs a single multiplication operation. However, we can further optimize it by eliminating the unnecessary input/output operations.

2. We can remove the `cin` statement since the value of `n` is not being used in any other computation.

3. We can also remove the `using namespace std;` statement and explicitly qualify the `cout` object with the `std` namespace to adhere to good coding practices.

4. Finally, we can remove the `return 0;` statement as it is not necessary in the `main` function.

Optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  int n = 0;
  std::cout << n * n * n << std::endl;
}
```
