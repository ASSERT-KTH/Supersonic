The original program simply takes an input number, multiplies it by itself three times, and outputs the result. There is not much room for optimization in terms of running time, as the program only performs a single arithmetic operation.

However, we can optimize the memory usage by eliminating the unnecessary use of the `iostream` library. Since we only need to perform simple input and output operations, we can use the lighter-weight `stdio` library instead.

Here is the optimized program using the `stdio` library:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  int n;
  scanf("%d", &n);
  printf("%d\n", n * n * n);
  return 0;
}
```

By using the `scanf` function instead of `cin` and the `printf` function instead of `cout`, we reduce the memory overhead of unnecessary library inclusion. This optimization does not affect the running time of the program, but it improves the memory usage.
