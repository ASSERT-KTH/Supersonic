To optimize the given program, we can eliminate the unnecessary use of the `iostream` library since we are not using any other I/O operations apart from reading and writing a single integer. Instead, we can use the `cstdio` library which provides faster I/O operations.

We can also remove the `using namespace std` statement and explicitly qualify the `cin`, `cout`, and `endl` objects with the `std` namespace to avoid namespace pollution.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <cstdio>

int main() {
  int n;
  std::scanf("%d", &n);
  std::printf("%lld\n", static_cast<long long>(n) * n * n);
  return 0;
}
```
