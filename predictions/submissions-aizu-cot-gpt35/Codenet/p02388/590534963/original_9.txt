The given program reads an integer from the user, calculates its cube, and then prints the result. 

To optimize this program, we can eliminate the unnecessary multiplication operations.

Explanation of optimization steps:
1. Instead of multiplying the number n three times to calculate its cube, we can calculate the cube directly by using the power function pow(n, 3). This will reduce the number of multiplication operations.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  int cube = pow(n, 3);
  cout << cube << endl;
  return 0;
}
```

In the optimized program, we include the `<cmath>` library to access the power function `pow()`. We then calculate the cube of the input number `n` using `pow(n, 3)` and store the result in the variable `cube`. Finally, we print the value of `cube`.
