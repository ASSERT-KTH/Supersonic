The given program takes an input from the user, calculates the cube of the input, and prints the result. To optimize the program, we can make two modifications:

1. Remove the unnecessary variable `y`.
2. Use the `<<` operator to directly print the result without storing it in a variable.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  int x;
  std::cin >> x;
  std::cout << x * x * x << "\n";
  return 0;
}
```
