The given program is a simple program that reads an integer from the user, calculates its cube, and then prints the result.

To optimize this program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove the unnecessary variable `y`: Since we only need to print the cube of the input number, we can directly print the result without storing it in a separate variable.

2. Use the `endl` instead of `"\n"`: The `endl` manipulator not only inserts a newline character, but it also flushes the output stream. This can improve the performance of the program.

Here is the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  int x;
  std::cin >> x;
  std::cout << x * x * x << std::endl;
  return 0;
}
```
