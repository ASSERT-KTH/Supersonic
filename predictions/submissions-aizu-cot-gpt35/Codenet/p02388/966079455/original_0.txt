The original program calculates the cube of an input number and outputs the result. To optimize this program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Eliminate the need for the `y` variable by directly calculating and outputting the result.

2. Remove the unnecessary input statement for `y` since it is not being used.

3. Improve memory usage by minimizing the use of variables.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  int x;
  std::cin >> x;
  std::cout << x * x * x << "\n";
  return 0;
}
```
