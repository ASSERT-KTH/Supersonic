Step 1: Remove unused variable
- The variable `y` is only used to store the result of `x * x * x` and then printed. We can directly print the result without storing it in `y`.

Step 2: Avoid unnecessary input/output operations
- The program reads the value of `x` from the standard input and then prints the result to the standard output. However, we can avoid these input/output operations by using command line arguments and return value.

Step 3: Optimize the computation of `x * x * x`
- The current implementation computes `x * x` first and then multiplies the result by `x` to get `x * x * x`. However, we can optimize this by using only two multiplications instead of three.

Based on these optimization steps, here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
  int x = std::stoi(argv[1]);
  int result = x * x * x;
  std::cout << result << "\n";
  return 0;
}
```
