The original program calculates the cube of an input number `x` and prints the result. 

To optimize the program, we can make two modifications:
1. We can remove the unnecessary variable `y` and directly calculate and print the cube of `x` in a single line.
2. We can use `printf` instead of `cout` for faster output.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  int x;
  std::cin >> x;
  
  printf("%d\n", x * x * x);
  
  return 0;
}
```
