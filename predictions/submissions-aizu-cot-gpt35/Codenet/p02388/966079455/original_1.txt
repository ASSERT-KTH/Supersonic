The given program is a simple program that reads an integer from the user, calculates its cube, and then prints the result.

To optimize the program for running time and memory usage, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary variable `y` and calculate the cube directly in the `std::cout` statement.

2. Remove the `"\n"` from the `std::cout` statement and use `std::endl` instead. This will flush the output stream, but it may have a small impact on performance.

3. Add `#include <ios>` to include the necessary header for `std::endl`.

Here is the optimized C++ program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <ios>

int main() {
  int x;
  std::cin >> x;
  std::cout << x * x * x << std::endl;
  return 0;
}
```
