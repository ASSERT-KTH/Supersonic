The given C/C++ program reads a sequence of strings and counts the number of times certain combinations of strings appear. The program uses a series of if-else statements to compare the current string with the previous string and update the count accordingly.

To optimize this program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary header files: The program includes the header file `<bits/stdc++.h>` which is not required. We can remove this line.

2. Remove unnecessary macros: The program defines macros `rep`, `REP`, `rer`, `each`, `all`, and `mset` which are not used. We can remove these macro definitions.

3. Replace unnecessary typedefs: The program defines typedefs for `ll`, `ull`, `vi`, `vs`, `vvi`, `vpii`, `pii`, and `pll` which are not used. We can remove these typedefs.

4. Simplify if-else statements: The program uses a series of if-else statements to compare the current string with the previous string. We can simplify this by using a switch statement and assigning values to each string combination. This eliminates the need for multiple if-else statements.

5. Remove unnecessary variables: The program defines a variable `next` which is only used to read the next string from input. We can remove this variable and read the string directly into the `now` variable.

Taking these optimizations into account, the optimized C/C++ program is as follows:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int n;
  while (cin >> n, n) {
    int ans = 0;
    string now = "";
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
      cin >> now;
      switch (now[0]) {
        case 'l':
          if (now[1] == 'u' && now[2] == 'r') ans++;
          break;
        case 'r':
          if (now[1] == 'u' && now[2] == 'l') ans++;
          break;
        case 'l':
          if (now[1] == 'd' && now[2] == 'r') ans++;
          break;
        case 'r':
          if (now[1] == 'd' && now[2] == 'l') ans++;
          break;
      }
    }
    cout << ans << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```
