The given program reads an integer `n` from the input and then reads `n` strings. It counts the number of times a specific pattern of strings occurs and prints the count.

To optimize this program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary include statements: The program includes the entire `bits/stdc++.h` header, which is not necessary. We can remove it and include only the necessary headers.

2. Remove unnecessary macros: The program defines several macros (`rep`, `REP`, `rer`, `each`, `all`, `mset`) which are not used. We can remove them.

3. Remove unnecessary typedefs: The program defines several typedefs (`ll`, `ull`, `vi`, `vs`, `vvi`, `vpii`, `pii`, `pll`) which are not used. We can remove them.

4. Use `getline` instead of `cin` to read strings: Instead of using `cin` to read strings, we can use `getline` to read the entire line at once. This can improve the performance as it avoids the overhead of parsing the input stream.

5. Use a boolean flag to check the pattern: Instead of checking each possible combination of `now` and `next` strings using if-else statements, we can use a boolean flag to check if the pattern is matched. This eliminates the need for multiple comparisons and improves the readability of the code.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int n;
  while (cin >> n, n) {
    int ans = 0;
    string now = "", next;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
      getline(cin, next);
      bool patternMatched = false;
      if ((now == "lu" && next == "ru") || (now == "ru" && next == "lu") ||
          (now == "ld" && next == "rd") || (now == "rd" && next == "ld")) {
        patternMatched = true;
      }
      if (patternMatched) {
        ans++;
      }
      now = next;
    }
    cout << ans << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```

The optimized program is more concise and efficient than the original one.
