Step 1: Remove unnecessary includes

The program currently includes `<bits/stdc++.h>`, which includes a large number of standard library headers. This can increase the compilation time and memory usage. Since the program does not use any specific headers from this include, we can remove it.

Step 2: Remove unused typedefs

The program defines several typedefs that are not used in the code. We can remove these to simplify the code.

Step 3: Optimize the loop

Currently, the program uses a loop to iterate through `n` elements. However, the loop variable `i` is not used within the loop. We can replace the loop with a more efficient approach to avoid unnecessary iterations.

Step 4: Simplify the conditionals

The program currently uses a series of `if` statements to check the values of `now` and `next` strings. We can simplify these conditionals to make the code more readable and potentially more efficient.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int n;
  while (cin >> n, n) {
    int ans = 0;
    string now, next;
    cin >> now;
    for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
      cin >> next;
      if ((now == "lu" && next == "ru") ||
          (now == "ru" && next == "lu") ||
          (now == "ld" && next == "rd") ||
          (now == "rd" && next == "ld")) {
        ++ans;
      }
      now = next;
    }
    cout << ans << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Explanation:

1. Removed unnecessary includes.
2. Removed unused typedefs.
3. Replaced the `rep` macro with a standard `for` loop to avoid unnecessary iterations.
4. Simplified the conditionals using logical OR (`||`) operator.
