The given program is a C++ program that takes an array of integers as input and partitions it based on a pivot element. The partition function rearranges the elements such that all elements less than or equal to the pivot are placed before it, and all elements greater than the pivot are placed after it. The main function reads the input array, calls the partition function, and then prints the partitioned array.

To optimize this program, we can make the following changes:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The program includes the `<algorithm>` and `<cstdio>` headers, but doesn't actually use any functions from `<algorithm>`. We can remove this unnecessary include.

2. Replace `std::printf` with `std::cout`: The `print_partition_ints` function uses `std::printf` to print the elements of the partitioned array. We can replace it with `std::cout` for better performance.

3. Use `std::vector` instead of variable-length arrays: The program declares an array `as` with a variable length `n`. Using variable-length arrays is a C99 feature and not standard in C++. We can replace it with a `std::vector<int>` to have a dynamically resizable array.

4. Use iterators instead of indices in the partition function: The `partition` function uses indices to iterate over the array elements. We can modify it to use iterators instead, which can improve readability and potentially performance.

5. Use `std::partition` algorithm: The `partition` function manually partitions the array by swapping elements. We can use the `std::partition` algorithm from the `<algorithm>` header to achieve the same result, potentially with better performance.

Here's the optimized version of the program incorporating these changes:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

using uint = unsigned int;

static void print_partition_ints(const std::vector<int>& as, const uint q, const uint n) {
  auto out_sep = "";
  for (auto i = 0u; i < n; ++i) {
    auto format = (i != q ? "%s%d" : "%s[%d]");
    std::cout << format << out_sep << as[i];
    out_sep = " ";
  }
  std::cout << std::endl;
}

static uint partition(std::vector<int>& as, const uint first, const uint last) {
  auto pivot = as[last];
  auto less = std::partition(as.begin() + first, as.begin() + last, [pivot](const int& element) {
    return element <= pivot;
  });
  std::swap(*less, as[last]);
  return std::distance(as.begin(), less);
}

int main() {
  uint n;
  std::cin >> n;
  std::vector<int> as(n);
  for (auto i = 0u; i < n; ++i) {
    std::cin >> as[i];
  }
  auto q = partition(as, 0, n - 1);
  print_partition_ints(as, q, n);
}
```

These optimizations improve the program's readability, maintainability, and performance.
