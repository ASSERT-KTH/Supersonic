Step 1: Remove unnecessary headers
- The `<iostream>` header is not used in the program, so it can be removed.

Step 2: Remove unused variables
- The variable `factmodary` is not used after it is initialized, so it can be removed.
- The variable `fact` is not used after the loop, so it can be removed.

Step 3: Avoid unnecessary memory allocation
- The `word` array is allocated with a size of 100,000, but it is only used within each iteration of the outer loop. We can move its declaration and initialization inside the loop to avoid unnecessary memory allocation.

Step 4: Avoid unnecessary map operations
- The map `bubblehist` is used to keep track of the number of previous elements less than the current element. Instead of using a map, we can use a simple array `bubblenum` to store the counts. Since the elements are integers, we can initialize the array with a size equal to the maximum value of `N` and initialize all elements to 0. By doing this, we can avoid the overhead of map operations.

Step 5: Simplify the calculation of `ans`
- Instead of using the `factmodary` array, we can calculate the factorial modulo `divisor` on the fly using a variable `fact`. This way, we can simplify the calculations of `ans` in each iteration.

Step 6: Optimize the loop iterations
- In the original program, the loop `for (;;) {...}` is used to repeatedly read input until `N` becomes 0. This can be optimized by checking `N` immediately after reading it, and breaking the loop if it is 0.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

const int divisor = 1000000007;

int main() {
  for (;;) {
    int N, R;
    cin >> N;
    if (N == 0)
      break;
    cin >> R;
    
    int word[N];
    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++)
      word[i] = i + 1;

    for (int i = 0; i < R; i++) {
      int s, t;
      cin >> s >> t;
      swap(word[s - 1], word[t - 1]);
    }
    
    int bubblenum[N];
    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++)
      bubblenum[i] = 0;
    
    long long ans = 0;
    long long fact = 1;
    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
      int facttime = word[i] - 1;
      int count = 0;
      for (int j = 0; j < i; j++) {
        if (word[j] < word[i])
          count++;
      }
      bubblenum[i] = count;
      
      ans += (fact * facttime) % divisor;
      ans %= divisor;
      
      fact *= (i + 1);
      fact %= divisor;
    }
    
    cout << ans << "\n";
  }
  
  return 0;
}
```
