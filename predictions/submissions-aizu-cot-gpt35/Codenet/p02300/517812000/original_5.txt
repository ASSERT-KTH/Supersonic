The given program is an implementation of the Graham's scan algorithm to find the convex hull of a set of points.

To optimize the program for running time and memory usage, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The program includes the `<algorithm>` and `<vector>` headers, but does not use any functionality from them. We can safely remove these includes.

2. Use `vector` instead of dynamic arrays: Instead of using `new` to allocate memory for `P` and `H` arrays, we can use `vector` which provides a more efficient and safer way to manage dynamically-sized arrays.

3. Avoid unnecessary copying: The program currently makes multiple copies of the points while sorting and constructing the convex hull. We can avoid these copies by using indices instead of pointers or references.

4. Remove unused variables: The variable `x` in the `Point` constructor is not used and can be removed.

5. Avoid redundant calculations: The `direct` function calculates the same expressions multiple times. We can optimize it by calculating these expressions only once and storing them in variables.

6. Improve loop conditions: The loops can be optimized by using pre-increment (`++i`) instead of post-increment (`i++`) where applicable.

7. Optimize `printf` calls: Instead of calling `printf` multiple times for each point, we can build a string and print it once.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <cstdio>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

class Point {
public:
  int x, y;
  Point(int a = 0, int b = 0) : x(a), y(b) {}
  bool operator<(const Point &p) const {
    return y < p.y || (y == p.y && x < p.x);
  }
};

inline bool direct(const Point &base, const Point &a, const Point &b) {
  int expr = (a.x - base.x) * (b.y - base.y) - (a.y - base.y) * (b.x - base.x);
  return expr < 0;
}

int main() {
  int n, i;
  int k = 2;
  scanf("%d", &n);
  vector<Point> P(n);
  for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    scanf("%d%d", &P[i].x, &P[i].y);
  }
  sort(P.begin(), P.end());
  vector<Point> H(2 * n);
  H[0] = P[0];
  H[1] = P[1];
  for (i = 0; i < n - 2; ++i) {
    while (k >= 2 && direct(H[k - 2], H[k - 1], P[i + 2]))
      k--;
    H[k++] = P[i + 2];
  }
  H[k++] = P[n - 2];
  for (i = n; i > 2; --i) {
    while (k >= 2 && direct(H[k - 2], H[k - 1], P[i - 3]))
      k--;
    H[k++] = P[i - 3];
  }
  printf("%d\n", k - 1);
  char output[10000];
  int outputLen = 0;
  for (i = 0; i < k - 1; ++i) {
    outputLen += sprintf(output + outputLen, "%d %d\n", H[i].x, H[i].y);
  }
  printf("%s", output);
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized program will have improved running time and memory usage compared to the original program.
