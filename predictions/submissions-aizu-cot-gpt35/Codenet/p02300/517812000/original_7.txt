To optimize the given program, I would make the following modifications:

1. Move the `using namespace std;` statement inside the `main()` function. This will limit the scope of the `namespace std` to just the `main()` function, reducing the chances of naming conflicts and improving compilation speed.

2. Remove the unnecessary `inline` keyword from the `direct()` function. The `inline` keyword is a suggestion to the compiler to inline the function, but modern compilers are smart enough to decide when to inline a function without this hint. Removing it can potentially improve the code size and execution time.

3. Change the `Point` class constructor to use initialization lists instead of assignments inside the body of the constructor. This allows for more efficient initialization of the member variables.

4. Replace the usage of dynamic arrays (`new` and `delete`) with `std::vector`. This will simplify memory management and improve the efficiency of array operations.

5. Change the loop counters to start from 0 instead of 1. This is more idiomatic in C/C++ and avoids potential off-by-one errors.

6. Update the `printf` and `scanf` calls to use the C++ stream-based I/O (`cout` and `cin`) instead. Stream-based I/O is generally safer and more efficient than the C library functions.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

class Point {
public:
  int x, y;
  Point(int a = 0, int b = 0) : x(a), y(b) {}
  bool operator<(const Point &p) const {
    return y < p.y || (y == p.y && x < p.x);
  }
};

bool direct(Point &base, Point &a, Point &b) {
  return (a.x - base.x) * (b.y - base.y) - (a.y - base.y) * (b.x - base.x) < 0;
}

int main() {
  int n;
  std::cin >> n;

  std::vector<Point> P(n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    std::cin >> P[i].x >> P[i].y;
  }

  std::sort(P.begin(), P.end());

  std::vector<Point> H(2 * n);
  H[0] = P[0];
  H[1] = P[1];
  int k = 2;

  for (int i = 0; i < n - 2; ++i) {
    while (k >= 2 && direct(H[k - 2], H[k - 1], P[i + 2]))
      k--;
    H[k++] = P[i + 2];
  }

  H[k++] = P[n - 2];

  for (int i = n; i > 2; i--) {
    while (k >= 2 && direct(H[k - 2], H[k - 1], P[i - 3]))
      k--;
    H[k++] = P[i - 3];
  }

  std::cout << k - 1 << "\n";
  for (int i = 0; i < k - 1; ++i) {
    std::cout << H[i].x << " " << H[i].y << "\n";
  }

  return 0;
}
```

These optimizations should improve the running time and memory usage of the program while maintaining the same functionality.
