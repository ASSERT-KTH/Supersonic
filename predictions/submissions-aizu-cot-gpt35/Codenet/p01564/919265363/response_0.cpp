To optimize the given program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary headers: The program includes several unnecessary headers that are not used in the code. We can remove them to improve compilation time and reduce memory usage.

2. Remove unused typedefs: The program defines several typedefs that are not used. We can remove them to simplify the code.

3. Remove unnecessary member variables and functions in the link_cut_tree class: The link_cut_tree class has several member variables and functions that are not used in the main program. We can remove them to simplify the code and reduce memory usage.

4. Remove the scan function in the link_cut_tree class: The scan function in the link_cut_tree class is not used in the main program. We can remove it to simplify the code and improve running time.

5. Remove the ass struct: The ass struct is not used in the main program. We can remove it to simplify the code and reduce memory usage.

6. Remove the unused variable t1: The variable t1 is declared but not used in the main program. We can remove it to simplify the code.

7. Remove unnecessary calls to the scan function: The scan function is called multiple times in the main program, but it is not necessary. We can remove the unnecessary calls to improve running time.
