The first optimization we can make is to remove the unnecessary includes. Since we are not using all the libraries included, we can remove the unused ones to reduce the compilation time and memory usage.

The second optimization we can make is to remove the unnecessary typedefs. The typedefs in the struct `LCNode` can be removed since they are not being used.

The third optimization we can make is to use `const int` instead of `#define` for the constants `INF` and `DF`. Using `const int` is safer and more readable.

The fourth optimization we can make is to remove the unnecessary `push()` and `supush()` functions. These functions are not being used and can be safely removed.

The fifth optimization we can make is to remove the unnecessary `revdata()` and `lzdata()` functions. These functions can be replaced with inline code in the `evert()` function.

The sixth optimization we can make is to remove the unnecessary `update()` function. The `update()` function is only being called in the `expose()` function. We can inline the code from `update()` directly into `expose()` to eliminate the function call overhead.

The seventh optimization we can make is to remove the unnecessary `last_d` object. We can replace `last_d` with `last` in the `expose()` function.

The eighth optimization we can make is to remove the unnecessary `p` member variable. Since `p` is only being used in the `rot()` function, we can replace it with a local variable in the `rot()` function.

The ninth optimization we can make is to remove the unnecessary `pos()` function. We can replace the code in `pos()` with a simple check in the `rot()` function.

The tenth optimization we can make is to remove the unnecessary `rev` member variable. Since `rev` is only being used in the `revdata()` function, we can replace it with a local variable in the `revdata()` function.

The eleventh optimization we can make is to remove the unnecessary `lz` member variable. Since `lz` is only being used in the `lzdata()` function, we can replace it with a local variable in the `lzdata()` function.

The twelfth optimization we can make is to remove the unnecessary `sz` member variable. We can calculate `sz` on the fly by adding 1 to the sizes of the left and right subtrees.

The thirteenth optimization we can make is to remove the unnecessary `lsm` and `rsm` member variables. We can calculate `lsm` and `rsm` on the fly by taking the maximum of the left and right subtree sums.

The fourteenth optimization we can make is to remove the unnecessary `ma` member variable. We can calculate `ma` on the fly by taking the maximum of the left and right subtree sums and adding the current value.

The fifteenth optimization we can make is to remove the unnecessary `mv` member variable. We can calculate `mv` on the fly by taking the maximum of the current value and the maximum values of the left and right subtrees.

The sixteenth optimization we can make is to remove the unnecessary `last` array. We can replace `last` with `NULL` in the `expose()` function.

After applying these optimizations, the optimized program is as follows:
