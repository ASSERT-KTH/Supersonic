The given program calculates the minimum value of `m` for a given input `e`. It does so by iterating through values of `z` and `y`, and calculating the corresponding values of `val` and `val2`. It then checks if `val2` is less than or equal to `e` and updates the value of `m` accordingly.

To optimize the program, we can make the following improvements:

1. Remove unnecessary include statements: The program includes the entire `bits/stdc++.h` header, which includes a large number of standard library headers. We can remove this line and include only the required headers (`iostream`, `cmath`, and `algorithm`).

2. Avoid unnecessary function calls: The program uses the `sqrt` function multiple times within the inner loop. We can avoid this by calculating the square root outside the loop and storing it in a variable.

3. Use more efficient loop conditions: The program currently uses a decrementing loop condition (`z >= 0` and `y >= 0`). We can change the loop conditions to incrementing conditions (`z <= 100` and `y <= sqrt(e - val)`). This allows us to remove the unnecessary decrement operations.

4. Use more efficient variable assignments: The program uses the `min` function to update the value of `m`. Instead, we can directly compare the values and update `m` using a simple if statement.

Taking these optimizations into consideration, the optimized program is as follows:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

int main() {
  int e;
  while (cin >> e, e) {
    int m = 1000000;
    for (int z = 0; z <= 100; ++z) {
      int val = z * z * z;
      if (val > e)
        continue;
      
      int sqrt_e_val = sqrt(e - val);
      for (int y = 0; y <= sqrt_e_val; ++y) {
        int val2 = val + y * y;
        if (val2 > e)
          continue;
        
        int new_m = (e - val2) + y + z;
        if (new_m < m)
          m = new_m;
      }
    }
    cout << m << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```

These optimizations should improve the running time and memory usage of the program.
