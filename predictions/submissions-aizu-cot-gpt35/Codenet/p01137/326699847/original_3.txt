The given program calculates the minimum number of steps required to reach a given number "e" by performing a series of operations. The program uses nested loops and mathematical calculations to find the minimum number of steps.

To optimize the program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The program includes the entire "bits/stdc++.h" library, which is not necessary for this program. We can remove it and only include the necessary headers.

2. Avoid using "using namespace std": The program uses the "using namespace std" directive, which brings all the names in the "std" namespace into the global namespace. This can lead to naming conflicts and is generally considered bad practice. Instead, we can use the "std::" prefix to specify the namespace for the standard library functions.

3. Replace "cin >> e" with "scanf("%d", &e)": The program uses the "cin" stream for input. However, the "scanf" function is generally faster for reading integers from standard input.

4. Avoid recalculating values: The program calculates the value "z * z * z" in each iteration of the outer loop. We can calculate this value once and reuse it in the inner loop.

5. Replace "sqrt(e - val)" with "int(sqrt(e - val))": The program calculates the square root of "e - val" in each iteration of the inner loop. However, the result of this calculation is always an integer, so we can cast the result to an integer to avoid unnecessary floating-point calculations.

6. Replace "cout << m << endl" with "printf("%d\n", m)": The program uses the "cout" stream for output. However, the "printf" function is generally faster for printing integers to standard output.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>

int main(void) {
  int e;
  while (scanf("%d", &e), e) {
    int m = 1000000;
    for (int z = 100; z >= 0; --z) {
      int val = z * z * z;
      if (val > e)
        continue;
      int sqrt_e_val = int(sqrt(e - val));
      for (int y = sqrt_e_val; y >= 0; --y) {
        int val2 = val + y * y;
        if (val2 > e)
          continue;
        m = std::min(m, (e - val2) + y + z);
      }
    }
    printf("%d\n", m);
  }
  return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}
```
