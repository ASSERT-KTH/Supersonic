This program calculates the minimum number of terms required to represent a given number 'e' as the sum of cubes and squares of non-negative integers.

To optimize this program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary include statement: The `#include "bits/stdc++.h"` includes a large number of standard library headers, which is unnecessary for this program. We can remove it and include only the necessary headers.

2. Avoid using unnecessary macros: The `ALL(a)` macro is not used in the program. We can remove it to simplify the code.

3. Replace `sqrt(e - val)` with a pre-calculated value: The expression `sqrt(e - val)` is repeatedly calculated in the inner loop. We can calculate it once before entering the loop to improve performance.

4. Use a more efficient loop structure: The current loop structure `for (int z = 100; z >= 0; --z)` starts from 100 and goes down to 0. We can optimize this by starting the loop from the square root of `e` and going down to 0. This will reduce the number of iterations and improve runtime.

5. Use a more efficient initialization of `m`: The variable `m` is initialized to a large value of 1000000 in every iteration of the while loop. We can move the initialization outside the while loop to avoid unnecessary reinitialization.

Here is the optimized C++ program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>
using namespace std;

int main(void) {
  int e;
  int m = 1000000;
  
  while (cin >> e, e) {
    int val = 0;
    int sqrt_e_val = sqrt(e);
    
    for (int z = sqrt_e_val; z >= 0; --z) {
      val = z * z * z;
      if (val > e)
        continue;
        
      int sqrt_e_val_minus_val = sqrt(e - val);
      for (int y = sqrt_e_val_minus_val; y >= 0; --y) {
        int val2 = val + y * y;
        if (val2 > e)
          continue;
        m = min(m, (e - val2) + y + z);
      }
    }
    
    cout << m << endl;
  }
  
  return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}
```

This optimized program reduces unnecessary calculations, improves loop structure, and optimizes variable initialization. It should result in improved runtime and memory usage compared to the original program.
