Explanation of optimization steps:

1. Remove unnecessary header file inclusion: The current program includes the "bits/stdc++.h" header file, which is not a standard C++ header file. It includes a lot of unnecessary header files, which can slow down the compilation process. We can remove it and include only the necessary header files.

2. Remove unnecessary macros: The program defines two macros, ALL(a) and debug(x), but they are not used anywhere in the program. We can remove these macros to simplify the code.

3. Optimize the inner loop termination condition: The inner loop terminates when y >= 0. However, the loop condition can be optimized by checking if (y * y) > (e - val) instead of y >= 0. This can potentially reduce the number of iterations in the inner loop.

4. Optimize the min() function usage: The program uses the min() function to find the minimum value of m. However, we can optimize this by using a simple if statement to update the minimum value of m.

5. Remove unnecessary variable initialization: The variable "m" is initialized with a large value (1000000) at each iteration of the outer loop. However, we can initialize "m" with the maximum possible value before entering the outer loop to avoid unnecessary re-initialization.

Optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>

int main() {
  int e;
  while (std::cin >> e, e) {
    int m = INT_MAX;
    for (int z = 100; z >= 0; --z) {
      int val = z * z * z;
      if (val > e)
        continue;
      for (int y = sqrt(e - val); (y * y) > (e - val); --y) {
        int val2 = val + y * y;
        if (val2 > e)
          continue;
        if ((e - val2) + y + z < m)
          m = (e - val2) + y + z;
      }
    }
    std::cout << m << std::endl;
  }
  return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}
```
