The given program calculates the minimum number of operations required to obtain a given number 'e' by performing three different operations: multiplying a number by itself three times, adding a number to itself twice, and subtracting a number from 'e'.

To optimize this program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary includes and macros: The program includes the entire `bits/stdc++.h` library, which is not necessary for this program. We can remove this include statement. Similarly, the macros `ALL(a)` and `debug(x)` are not used in the program and can be removed.

2. Replace `sqrt(e - val)` with a variable: The expression `sqrt(e - val)` is computed in every iteration of the inner loop. We can compute this value once and store it in a variable to avoid redundant computation.

3. Optimize the loop conditions: The inner loop iterates from `sqrt(e - val)` to 0, and the outer loop iterates from 100 to 0. We can optimize the loop conditions by starting the outer loop from `sqrt(e)` and ending it at 0, and starting the inner loop from `e - z*z*z` and ending it at 0. This optimization reduces the number of iterations in both loops.

4. Optimize the minimum calculation: The minimum value `m` is currently calculated using the `min` function in every iteration of the inner loop. Instead, we can store the minimum value in a separate variable and update it only when a smaller value is found. This avoids unnecessary function calls and improves performance.

Here is the optimized C++ program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>
using namespace std;

int main(void) {
  int e;
  while (cin >> e, e) {
    int m = 1000000;
    int sqrt_e = sqrt(e);
    for (int z = sqrt_e; z >= 0; --z) {
      int val = z * z * z;
      int sqrt_e_minus_val = sqrt(e - val);
      for (int y = sqrt_e_minus_val; y >= 0; --y) {
        int val2 = val + y * y;
        if (val2 > e)
          continue;
        int temp = (e - val2) + y + z;
        if (temp < m)
          m = temp;
      }
    }
    cout << m << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized program reduces redundant computations, optimizes loop conditions, and avoids unnecessary function calls, resulting in improved running time and memory usage.
