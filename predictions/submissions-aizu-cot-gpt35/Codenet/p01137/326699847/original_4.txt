The given program calculates the minimum number of steps required to reach a given number 'e' using the formula `val = z * z * z + y * y`, where 'z' and 'y' are non-negative integers.

To optimize the program, we can make the following changes:

1. Remove unnecessary header inclusion: The program includes the entire `<bits/stdc++.h>` header file, which is not necessary. We can include specific headers that are required for the program.

2. Remove unused macros: The program defines two macros `ALL(a)` and `debug(x)` which are not used. We can remove them.

3. Optimize the loop bounds: The outer loop iterates from 100 to 0 for 'z', and the inner loop iterates from sqrt(e - val) to 0 for 'y'. However, we can optimize these loop bounds by calculating the maximum value of 'z' and 'y' based on the given formula. The maximum value of 'z' can be calculated as `cbrt(e)`, and the maximum value of 'y' can be calculated as `sqrt(e - cbrt(e)*cbrt(e)*cbrt(e))`. This optimization will reduce the number of iterations in the loops.

4. Initialize 'm' outside the loop: The variable 'm' is initialized to 1000000 inside the loop, which is unnecessary. We can move the initialization outside the loop to avoid repeated initialization.

5. Use '+=', '-=', and '*=' operators: Instead of using `m = min(m, (e - val2) + y + z)`, we can use `m += (e - val2) + y + z` to reduce the number of operations. Similarly, instead of `val = z * z * z`, we can use `val *= z` and instead of `val2 = val + y * y`, we can use `val2 += y * y`. This optimization will reduce the number of multiplications.

Here is the optimized C++ program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int e;
  while (cin >> e, e) {
    int m = 1000000;
    int maxZ = cbrt(e);
    int maxY = sqrt(e - maxZ * maxZ * maxZ);
    for (int z = maxZ; z >= 0; --z) {
      int val = z * z * z;
      if (val > e)
        continue;
      for (int y = maxY; y >= 0; --y) {
        int val2 = val + y * y;
        if (val2 > e)
          continue;
        m += (e - val2) + y + z;
      }
    }
    cout << m << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```
