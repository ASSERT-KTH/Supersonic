Step 1: Avoid unnecessary includes

The program includes the entire `bits/stdc++.h` header, which is a non-standard header and includes a large number of other headers. This can significantly increase compile time and memory usage. Instead, we should include only the necessary headers for the program.

Step 2: Avoid unnecessary macros

The program defines two macros, `ALL(a)` and `debug(x)`, but they are not used in the code. We should remove these macros to improve the program's readability and avoid unnecessary preprocessing.

Step 3: Optimize the loop conditions

The program uses two nested loops to iterate over values of `z` and `y`. The current loop conditions are `z >= 0` and `y >= 0`, which means the loops will continue until `z` and `y` become negative. However, we can optimize these conditions to terminate the loops earlier.

For the outer loop, we know that `z` ranges from 100 to 0, so we can change the condition to `z > 0` to avoid unnecessary iterations.

For the inner loop, we calculate `val2 = val + y * y` and compare it with `e`. We can change the condition to `val2 <= e` to terminate the loop as soon as `val2` becomes larger than `e`.

Step 4: Replace `sqrt` function with a variable

The program calculates `sqrt(e - val)` in every iteration of the inner loop. Instead of calling the `sqrt` function repeatedly, we can calculate this value once and store it in a variable before starting the inner loop.

Step 5: Update the minimum value calculation

The program uses the `min` function to update the minimum value `m`. However, instead of calling the `min` function in every iteration, we can use a simple if statement to update `m` when a smaller value is found.

Here's the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int e;
  while (cin >> e, e) {
    int m = 1000000;
    for (int z = 100; z > 0; --z) {
      int val = z * z * z;
      if (val > e)
        continue;
      int sqrt_val = sqrt(e - val);
      for (int y = sqrt_val; y >= 0; --y) {
        int val2 = val + y * y;
        if (val2 > e)
          continue;
        int temp = (e - val2) + y + z;
        if (temp < m)
          m = temp;
      }
    }
    cout << m << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```
