To optimize the given program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary header files: The program includes `<bits/stdc++.h>` which includes a large number of standard library header files. We can remove this and include only the necessary header files that are actually used in the program.

2. Remove unused typedefs: The program contains typedefs for `ll`, `ull`, `vi`, `vs`, `vvi`, `vpii`, `pii`, and `pll`. However, these typedefs are not used in the program and can be removed.

3. Replace `cin` and `cout` with faster I/O methods: The program uses `cin` and `cout` for input and output. However, these are relatively slow compared to other I/O methods like `scanf` and `printf`. We can replace `cin` with `scanf` and `cout` with `printf` to improve the I/O performance.

4. Remove unnecessary macros: The program defines macros like `rep`, `REP`, `rer`, `each`, `all`, and `mset`. However, these macros are not used in the program and can be removed.

5. Simplify the loop conditions: The program uses nested loops with complex conditions like `z * z * z <= e` and `y * y + z * z * z <= e`. We can simplify these conditions to improve readability and potentially optimize the loop performance.

Here is the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <cmath>

using namespace std;

int main() {
  int e;
  while (scanf("%d", &e), e) {
    int ans = 1000000000;
    int maxZ = cbrt(e);
    for (int z = 0; z <= maxZ; ++z) {
      int maxY = sqrt(e - z * z * z);
      for (int y = 0; y <= maxY; ++y) {
        int x = e - y * y - z * z * z;
        ans = min(ans, x + y + z);
      }
    }
    printf("%d\n", ans);
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Explanation of the optimization steps:

1. Removed unnecessary header files: The program only requires the iostream, vector, algorithm, and cmath headers. The `<bits/stdc++.h>` header includes a lot of unnecessary headers that are not used in the program.

2. Removed unused typedefs: The typedefs for `ll`, `ull`, `vi`, `vs`, `vvi`, `vpii`, `pii`, and `pll` were not used in the program and have been removed.

3. Replaced `cin` and `cout` with `scanf` and `printf`: The `scanf` and `printf` functions are faster than `cin` and `cout` for input and output operations. This change improves the I/O performance of the program.

4. Removed unnecessary macros: The macros `rep`, `REP`, `rer`, `each`, `all`, and `mset` were not used in the program and have been removed.

5. Simplified the loop conditions: The loop conditions `z * z * z <= e` and `y * y + z * z * z <= e` have been simplified to `z <= cbrt(e)` and `y <= sqrt(e - z * z * z)`, respectively. This improves the readability of the code and potentially optimizes the loop performance by avoiding unnecessary calculations in each iteration.
