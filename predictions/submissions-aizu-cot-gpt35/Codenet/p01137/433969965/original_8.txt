The given program calculates the minimum value of x + y + z such that x^2 + y^2 + z^3 = e.

To optimize the program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The program includes the entire C++ standard library using the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header. We can remove this and include only the necessary headers.

2. Remove unnecessary macros: The program defines macros for loop iteration. We can replace these macros with regular for loops.

3. Use more descriptive variable names: The variables `e`, `x`, `y`, and `z` are not very descriptive. We can rename them to make the code more readable.

4. Remove unnecessary typedefs: The program defines typedefs for various types that are not used. We can remove these typedefs.

5. Use more efficient data types: The program uses `int` for all variables, even when a smaller data type could be used. We can use `unsigned int` instead of `int` for variables that only take non-negative values.

6. Modify the outer loop condition: The outer loop condition `z * z * z <= e` can be modified to `z <= cbrt(e)`.

7. Modify the inner loop condition: The inner loop condition `y * y + z * z * z <= e` can be modified to `y <= sqrt(e - z * z * z)`.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>

const int inf = 1000000000;

int main() {
  unsigned int e;
  while (std::cin >> e, e) {
    int ans = inf;
    for (unsigned int z = 0; z <= cbrt(e); ++z) {
      for (unsigned int y = 0; y <= sqrt(e - z * z * z); ++y) {
        unsigned int x = e - (y * y + z * z * z);
        ans = std::min(ans, static_cast<int>(x + y + z));
      }
    }
    std::cout << ans << std::endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```
