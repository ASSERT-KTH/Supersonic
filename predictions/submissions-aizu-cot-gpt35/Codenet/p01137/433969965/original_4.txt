Optimization Step 1: Remove unnecessary headers

The program includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header, which is not a standard C++ header and is considered bad practice. It includes a large number of unnecessary headers, which can slow down compilation time. We can remove this header and include only the necessary headers explicitly.

Optimization Step 2: Remove unnecessary macros

The program defines several macros that are not used in the code. We can remove these macros to simplify the code and improve readability.

Optimization Step 3: Remove unnecessary typedefs

The program defines several typedefs that are not used in the code. We can remove these typedefs to simplify the code and improve readability.

Optimization Step 4: Optimize the loop conditions

The nested for loops in the main algorithm can be optimized by adjusting the loop conditions. Currently, the loop condition checks for `z * z * z <= e` and `y * y + z * z * z <= e` in each iteration. We can optimize this by calculating the maximum possible values of `z` and `y` based on the value of `e`. This will reduce the number of unnecessary iterations.

Optimization Step 5: Remove unnecessary variables

The variable `x` is only used to calculate the value of `ans` in each iteration. We can eliminate the need for `x` by directly calculating the sum of `y`, `z`, and the difference between `e` and `y * y + z * z * z`.

Based on these optimizations, here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>
#include <cmath>

int main() {
  int e;
  while (std::cin >> e, e) {
    int ans = std::numeric_limits<int>::max();
    int maxZ = std::cbrt(e);
    for (int z = 0; z <= maxZ; ++z) {
      int maxY = std::sqrt(e - z * z * z);
      for (int y = 0; y <= maxY; ++y) {
        int sum = y + z + (e - y * y - z * z * z);
        ans = std::min(ans, sum);
      }
    }
    std::cout << ans << std::endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized program removes unnecessary headers, macros, and typedefs to simplify the code. It also optimizes the loop conditions by calculating the maximum possible values of `z` and `y` based on the value of `e`. Additionally, it eliminates the need for the variable `x` by directly calculating the sum of `y`, `z`, and the difference between `e` and `y * y + z * z * z`.
