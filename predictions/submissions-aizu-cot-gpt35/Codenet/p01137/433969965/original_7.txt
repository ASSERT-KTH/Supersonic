The given program calculates the minimum value of `x + y + z` such that `x^2 + y^2 + z^3 = e`. It uses a nested loop to iterate over all possible values of `x`, `y`, and `z` to find the minimum value. 

To optimize the program, we can make the following changes:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The program includes the entire `bits/stdc++.h` library, which is not recommended. We can remove this and only include the necessary headers.

2. Remove unnecessary macros: The program defines several macros (`rep`, `REP`, `rer`, `each`, `all`, `mset`) which are not used. We can remove these macros.

3. Remove unnecessary typedefs: The program defines several typedefs (`ll`, `ull`, `vi`, `vs`, `vvi`, `vpii`, `pii`, `pll`) which are not used. We can remove these typedefs.

4. Remove unnecessary constants: The program defines several constants (`inf`, `mod`, `eps`, `dx`, `dy`) which are not used. We can remove these constants.

5. Use `int` instead of `long long`: The program uses `long long` for variables that can be represented by `int` (`ans`). We can use `int` instead to save memory.

6. Use pre-calculated values: The program calculates `z * z * z` multiple times in the inner loop. We can pre-calculate it once before the loop to improve performance.

7. Optimize the inner loop condition: The inner loop checks `y * y + z * z * z <= e` in every iteration. We can optimize this condition by checking `z * z * z <= e` in the outer loop and `y * y <= e - z * z * z` in the inner loop.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int e;
  while (cin >> e, e) {
    int ans = 1e9;
    for (int z = 0; z * z * z <= e; ++z) {
      int z_cubed = z * z * z;
      for (int y = 0; y * y <= e - z_cubed; ++y) {
        int x = e - (y * y + z_cubed);
        ans = min(ans, x + y + z);
      }
    }
    cout << ans << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Explanation of optimizations:

1. We removed unnecessary includes to reduce the size of the compiled program.

2. We removed unnecessary macros to simplify the code and improve readability.

3. We removed unnecessary typedefs to simplify the code and reduce memory usage.

4. We removed unnecessary constants to simplify the code and reduce memory usage.

5. We changed the type of `ans` from `long long` to `int` to save memory, since the maximum value of `ans` is `3 * e`.

6. We pre-calculated `z * z * z` outside the inner loop to avoid redundant calculations.

7. We optimized the inner loop condition to reduce the number of iterations by checking `y * y <= e - z * z * z` instead of `y * y + z * z * z <= e`.
