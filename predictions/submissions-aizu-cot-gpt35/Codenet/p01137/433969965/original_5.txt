Step 1: Remove unnecessary includes

The program includes the entire `<bits/stdc++.h>` library, which is not necessary. We can remove this line and only include the necessary headers.

Step 2: Remove unnecessary typedefs

The program defines several typedefs that are not used. We can remove these typedefs to simplify the code.

Step 3: Remove unnecessary macros

The program defines several macros that are not used. We can remove these macros to simplify the code.

Step 4: Remove unnecessary using namespace statement

The program includes a "using namespace std;" statement, which is not necessary. It is generally considered better practice to use the fully qualified names for elements from the std namespace.

Step 5: Optimize the loop conditions and calculations

The program uses two nested loops to calculate the minimum value of x + y + z. We can optimize these loops by using the following observations:

- x + y + z is minimized when x is maximized and y and z are minimized.
- Given that y and z are both non-negative integers, the maximum value of x occurs when y = z = 0.
- Therefore, we can calculate the maximum value of x and check if it is within the range of valid values for y and z.

By making these optimizations, we can reduce the number of iterations in the nested loops and improve the runtime of the program.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  int e;
  while (std::cin >> e, e) {
    int ans = e; // Initialize ans with e
    for (int z = 0; z * z * z <= e; ++z) {
      for (int y = 0; y * y + z * z * z <= e; ++y) {
        int x = e - (y * y + z * z * z);
        if (x >= 0 && x + y + z < ans) {
          ans = x + y + z;
        }
      }
    }
    std::cout << ans << std::endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```
