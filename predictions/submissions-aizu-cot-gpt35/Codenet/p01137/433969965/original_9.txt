To optimize the given program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary include statements: The program includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header, which is not a standard header and includes a large number of unnecessary headers. We can remove this line and include only the necessary headers.

2. Remove unnecessary typedefs: The program includes several typedefs that are not used in the code. We can remove these typedefs to simplify the code.

3. Remove unnecessary macros: The program uses several macros (`rep`, `REP`, `rer`, `each`, `all`, `mset`) that are not used in the code. We can remove these macros to simplify the code.

4. Use pre-calculated values: The program calculates `z * z * z` and `y * y + z * z * z` in the inner loops. We can pre-calculate these values before entering the loops to reduce the number of calculations.

5. Use a more efficient loop condition: The current loop condition `z * z * z <= e` and `y * y + z * z * z <= e` can be optimized to `z <= cbrt(e)` and `y <= sqrt(e - z * z * z)` respectively. This optimization reduces the number of calculations and iterations in the loops.

6. Use a more efficient variable initialization: The current initialization `int ans = inf` can be optimized to `int ans = e` since the minimum possible value of `ans` is `e`.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>

int main() {
  int e;
  while (std::cin >> e, e) {
    int ans = e;
    for (int z = 0; z <= std::cbrt(e); ++z) {
      int zz = z * z * z;
      for (int y = 0; y <= std::sqrt(e - zz); ++y) {
        int yy = y * y;
        int x = e - (yy + zz);
        ans = std::min(ans, x + y + z);
      }
    }
    std::cout << ans << std::endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Explanation:
- We removed the unnecessary include statements, typedefs, and macros to simplify the code.
- We pre-calculated `z * z * z` and `y * y` outside the inner loops to reduce the number of calculations.
- We optimized the loop conditions to reduce the number of iterations in the loops.
- We initialized `ans` with `e` since it is the minimum possible value.
- The overall logic of the program remains the same.
