The given program reads an input of strings and numbers and performs some calculations based on the input. 

To optimize the program, we can make a few modifications:

1. Instead of using a fixed-size array for `o` and `b`, we can use a dynamic array or a vector to avoid unnecessary memory allocation.

2. Instead of reading the input string character by character and comparing each character, we can use the `substr` function to extract the substring from the input string. We can then compare the substrings for equality. This would reduce the number of iterations in the innermost loop.

3. Instead of using the `bool` variable `f` to store whether a match is found, we can use a flag variable to break out of the loop as soon as a match is found.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int n, m;
  
  while (true) {
    cin >> n >> m;
    
    if (n == 0 && m == 0)
      break;
    
    int ans = 0;
    vector<int> o(n);
    vector<string> b(n);

    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
      cin >> b[i] >> o[i];
    
    for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
      string l;
      cin >> l;
      bool match = false;
      
      for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
        bool f = true;
        
        for (int k = 0; k < 8; k++) {
          if (b[j].substr(k, 1) != "*" && b[j].substr(k, 1) != l.substr(k, 1)) {
            f = false;
            break;
          }
        }
        
        if (f) {
          match = true;
          ans += o[j];
          break;
        }
      }
      
      if (!match)
        ans += 0;
    }
    
    cout << ans << endl;
  }
}
```
