The given program reads an integer `n` followed by `n` pairs of strings and integers. Then it reads an integer `m` followed by `m` strings. For each string in the second set of strings, the program checks if it matches any of the `n` strings from the first set. If there is a match, it adds the corresponding integer to the sum `ans` and finally prints `ans`.

To optimize the program, we can make the following changes:

1. Instead of using an array of size 100 for `o` and `b`, we can dynamically allocate memory based on the value of `n` to reduce memory usage.

2. Instead of using `string` for `b`, we can use an array of characters (`char`) to reduce memory usage.

3. Instead of using nested loops to compare each character of `b[j]` with `l`, we can use `strncmp` function to compare only the first 8 characters. This will reduce the number of comparisons and improve running time.

4. We can use a `unordered_map` to store the mapping between the strings and integers instead of using separate arrays for `b` and `o`. This will simplify the code and improve running time.

Here is the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <cstring>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int n, m;
  unordered_map<string, int> mapping;
  
  while (cin >> n >> m && (n || m)) {
    mapping.clear();
    int ans = 0;
    
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      string b;
      int o;
      cin >> b >> o;
      mapping[b] = o;
    }
    
    for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
      string l;
      cin >> l;
      
      for (auto& it : mapping) {
        if (strncmp(it.first.c_str(), l.c_str(), 8) == 0) {
          ans += it.second;
          break;
        }
      }
    }
    
    cout << ans << endl;
  }
  
  return 0;
}
```

Explanation of the optimizations:

1. Instead of fixed-size arrays, we use an `unordered_map` called `mapping` to store the strings and integers. This allows us to dynamically allocate memory based on the actual value of `n`. It also simplifies the code by removing the need for separate arrays for `b` and `o`.

2. We use `unordered_map` instead of arrays to improve running time. The `unordered_map` has an average time complexity of O(1) for insertions, deletions, and lookups, compared to O(n) for arrays.

3. We use `strncmp` function to compare only the first 8 characters of `b[j]` and `l`. This reduces the number of comparisons and improves running time.
