Step 1: Avoid unnecessary memory usage
- The original program uses an array of size 100 for both the `o` and `b` arrays, even though the input constraints are not specified. This can lead to unnecessary memory usage.
- To optimize memory usage, we can dynamically allocate memory for the `o` and `b` arrays based on the input values of `n` and `m`.

Step 2: Optimize the inner loop
- The inner loop compares each character of `b[j]` with the corresponding character of `l` to check for a match. However, we can optimize this loop by taking advantage of the fact that the strings are of length 8.
- Instead of using a loop, we can directly compare the characters using the `==` operator.

Step 3: Use a more efficient data structure
- The original program uses strings to represent binary patterns. However, comparing strings character by character can be inefficient.
- We can optimize this by using integers to represent the binary patterns. This allows us to compare the patterns using bitwise operations, which are more efficient.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int n, m;
  unordered_map<int, int> patterns;
  
  while (cin >> n >> m && (n != 0 || m != 0)) {
    patterns.clear();
    
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      string b;
      int o;
      cin >> b >> o;
      
      int pattern = 0;
      for (int j = 0; j < 8; j++) {
        pattern <<= 1;
        if (b[j] == '1') {
          pattern |= 1;
        }
      }
      
      patterns[pattern] = o;
    }
    
    int ans = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
      string l;
      cin >> l;
      
      int pattern = 0;
      for (int j = 0; j < 8; j++) {
        pattern <<= 1;
        if (l[j] == '1') {
          pattern |= 1;
        }
      }
      
      ans += patterns[pattern];
    }
    
    cout << ans << endl;
  }
  
  return 0;
}
```

Explanation of Optimization Steps:

1. Avoid unnecessary memory usage:
- The original program used fixed-size arrays for `o` and `b` with a size of 100. In the optimized program, we use an `unordered_map` called `patterns` to store the patterns and their corresponding values.
- This allows us to dynamically allocate memory based on the input values of `n` and `m`, avoiding unnecessary memory usage.

2. Optimize the inner loop:
- The original program used a nested loop to compare each character of `b[j]` with the corresponding character of `l` to check for a match.
- In the optimized program, we use a bitwise shift and bitwise OR operations to construct the binary pattern from the string. This allows us to compare the patterns using the `==` operator, which is more efficient than comparing characters one by one.

3. Use a more efficient data structure:
- The original program used strings to represent binary patterns and compared them character by character.
- In the optimized program, we use integers to represent the binary patterns. This allows us to compare the patterns using bitwise operations, which are more efficient.
- We store the patterns and their corresponding values in the `unordered_map` called `patterns`. This allows us to quickly access the value associated with a pattern using constant time lookup.
