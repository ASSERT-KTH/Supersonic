To optimize the given program, we can make the following changes:

1. Remove unnecessary header file inclusion: The program includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header file, which is not a standard C++ header file. It includes a large number of other header files, which may not be required for this program. We can remove this line and include only the necessary header files.

2. Remove unnecessary typedefs: The program defines typedefs for `vector<int>`, `pair<int, int>`, and `vector<pair<int, int>>`. However, these typedefs are not used in the program. We can remove these typedefs to simplify the code.

3. Remove unnecessary macros: The program defines macros for common operations such as iteration and vector manipulation. However, these macros are not used consistently throughout the code. We can remove these macros and use standard C++ syntax instead.

4. Optimize the calculation of `ans` in the `calc` function: The `calc` function calculates the minimum number of coins required to represent a given value `v`. It does this by iterating over the coin denominations and dividing `v` by each denomination. However, we can optimize this calculation by iterating over the coin denominations in reverse order and using integer division and modulo operators to calculate `ans` more efficiently.

5. Optimize the main loop: The main loop of the program iterates over the coin denominations and performs some calculations. However, there are some unnecessary calculations and conditions in this loop. We can simplify the loop by removing unnecessary calculations and conditions.

6. Optimize the calculation of `mi` in the final loop: The final loop of the program calculates the minimum value of `dp[0][i] + calc(i - P)` for `P` to `T`. However, we can optimize this calculation by starting the loop from `calc(P)` instead of `P` and using a variable `prev` to store the previous value of `dp[0][i] + calc(i - P)` to avoid unnecessary calculations.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <deque>
using namespace std;

const int T = 10000;
int C[6] = {1, 5, 10, 50, 100, 500};
int N[6];

int calc(int v) {
  int ans = 0;
  for (int i = 5; i >= 0; i--) {
    ans += v / C[i];
    v %= C[i];
  }
  return ans;
}

int main() {
  int P;
  while (cin >> P) {
    if (P == 0)
      break;
    for (int i = 0; i < 6; i++)
      cin >> N[i];

    int cnt = 0;
    for (int i = 5; i >= 0; i--) {
      while (P - C[i] >= 2500 && N[i]) {
        cnt++;
        N[i]--;
        P -= C[i];
      }
      if (N[i])
        break;
    }

    vector<vector<int>> dp(2, vector<int>(T, 1001001001));
    dp[0][0] = 0;

    for (int i = 0; i < 6; i++) {
      for (int j = 0; j < C[i]; j++) {
        deque<pair<int, int>> deq;
        for (int k = j; k < T; k += C[i]) {
          int w = T - k / C[i];
          dp[(i + 1) % 2][k] = min(dp[(i + 1) % 2][k], dp[i % 2][k]);
          while (!deq.empty() && deq.front().second + C[i] * N[i] < k)
            deq.pop_front();
          if (!deq.empty())
            dp[(i + 1) % 2][k] = min(dp[(i + 1) % 2][k], deq.front().first - w);
          if (!deq.empty() && deq.front().second + N[i] * C[i] <= k)
            deq.pop_front();
          deq.push_back(make_pair(dp[i % 2][k] + w, k));
        }
      }
    }

    int mi = 1001001001;
    int prev = 1001001001;
    for (int i = calc(P); i < T; i++) {
      prev = min(prev, dp[0][i] + calc(i - P));
      mi = min(mi, prev);
    }

    cout << mi + cnt << endl;
  }

  return 0;
}
```

The optimized program simplifies the code by removing unnecessary typedefs, macros, and header file inclusions. It also optimizes the calculation of `ans` in the `calc` function and removes unnecessary calculations and conditions in the main loop. Additionally, it optimizes the calculation of `mi` in the final loop by starting the loop from `calc(P)` and using a variable `prev` to store the previous value.
