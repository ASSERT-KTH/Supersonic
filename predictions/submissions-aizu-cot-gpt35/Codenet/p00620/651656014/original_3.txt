The given program is a solution to a problem that involves finding a path in a matrix. The program reads an integer `n` from input, followed by `n x n` integers representing the matrix elements. It then checks if it is possible to find a path from a negative number to a positive number in the matrix such that the sum of the numbers along the path is zero. If such a path exists, it outputs "YES", otherwise "NO".

To optimize the program, I would make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary headers: The program includes unnecessary headers such as `<algorithm>`, `<functional>`, `<map>`, `<stdio.h>`, and `<string>`. Since these headers are not used in the program, we can remove them to improve compile time and reduce memory usage.

2. Remove unnecessary typedefs: The program defines several typedefs (`ll`, `Point`, `SP`, `Mat`) that are not used. We can remove these typedefs to simplify the code and reduce memory usage.

3. Remove unnecessary global variables: The program declares several unnecessary global variables (`dx`, `dy`, `n`, `mat`, `used`, `starts`). These variables can be declared locally within the `solve` function to reduce memory usage and improve code readability.

4. Pass variables by reference: The `dfs` function currently accepts several parameters by value (`cur`, `sum`, `x`, `y`). Since these parameters are modified within the function, it is more efficient to pass them by reference.

5. Use `vector<bool>` instead of `vector<vector<bool>>`: The program uses a 2D vector (`used`) to keep track of visited positions in the matrix. However, the `vector<bool>` specialization is more memory efficient for storing boolean values. We can use a 1D vector (`used`) of size `n x n` instead.

6. Use `emplace_back` instead of `push_back`: The program uses `push_back` to add elements to the `starts` vector. However, `emplace_back` is more efficient as it constructs the element in-place without the need for an additional copy/move operation.

7. Use a single variable to check if the path exists: The program currently uses the `ret` variable to store whether the path exists or not. We can simplify the code by directly outputting "YES" or "NO" without the need for an intermediate variable.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int n;
  while (true) {
    cin >> n;
    if (n == 0) break;

    vector<int> starts;
    vector<int> used(n * n, false);
    int sum = 0;

    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
        int a;
        cin >> a;
        sum += a;
        if (a < 0) {
          a *= -1;
          used[i * n + j] = true;
          starts.emplace_back(a);
        }
      }
    }

    if (sum != 0) {
      cout << "NO" << endl;
      continue;
    }

    bool ret = false;
    if (starts.size() == 1) {
      ret = true;
    } else {
      sort(starts.rbegin(), starts.rend());
      int cur = 0;
      int x = starts[cur] % n;
      int y = starts[cur] / n;

      while (true) {
        if (starts[cur] == 0) {
          cur++;
          if (cur >= starts.size()) {
            ret = true;
            break;
          }
          x = starts[cur] % n;
          y = starts[cur] / n;
        } else if (starts[cur] < 0) {
          ret = false;
          break;
        }

        bool found = false;
        for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
          int nx = x + dx[i];
          int ny = y + dy[i];
          if (0 <= nx && nx < n && 0 <= ny && ny < n && !used[ny * n + nx]) {
            used[ny * n + nx] = true;
            starts[cur] += mat[ny * n + nx];
            x = nx;
            y = ny;
            found = true;
            break;
          }
        }

        if (!found) {
          starts[cur] *= -1;
          cur--;
          if (cur < 0) {
            ret = false;
            break;
          }
          x = starts[cur] % n;
          y = starts[cur] / n;
        }
      }
    }

    cout << (ret ? "YES" : "NO") << endl;
  }

  return 0;
}
