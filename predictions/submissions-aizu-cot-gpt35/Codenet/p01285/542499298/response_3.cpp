To optimize the given program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The program includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header, which is not necessary and can be removed.

2. Remove unused macros: The macros `REP`, `rep`, `EPS`, `equals`, `COUNTER_CLOCKWISE`, `CLOCKWISE`, `ONLINE_BACK`, `ONLINE_FRONT`, and `ON_SEGMENT` are defined but not used in the program. We can remove them to simplify the code.

3. Remove unnecessary operator overloads: The class `Point` defines several operator overloads (`operator+`, `operator-`, `operator*`, `operator/`, and `operator*` with `Point`), which are not used in the program. We can remove them to reduce unnecessary code.

4. Optimize `equals` function: The `equals` function is used to check if two floating-point values are equal. Instead of using `fabs` to compare the difference with `EPS`, we can directly compare the absolute difference. This can improve the performance of the function.

5. Optimize `ccw` function: The `ccw` function is used to determine the orientation of three points. We can optimize this function by avoiding unnecessary calculations. For example, we can calculate `cross(a, b)` only once instead of twice, and we can compare `cross(a, b)` with `0` instead of `EPS`.

6. Optimize `intersectLL` function: The `intersectLL` function is used to check if two lines intersect. We can optimize this function by avoiding unnecessary calculations. For example, we can calculate `cross(l.p2 - l.p1, m.p2 - m.p1)` only once instead of twice.

7. Optimize `intersectLS` function: The `intersectLS` function is used to check if a line and a line segment intersect. We can optimize this function by avoiding unnecessary calculations. For example, we can calculate `cross(l.p2 - l.p1, s.p1 - l.p1)` only once instead of twice.

8. Optimize `intersectLP` function: The `intersectLP` function is used to check if a line and a point intersect. We can optimize this function by avoiding unnecessary calculations. For example, we can calculate `cross(l.p2 - p, l.p1 - p)` only once instead of twice.

9. Optimize `intersectSS` function: The `intersectSS` function is used to check if two line segments intersect. We can optimize this function by avoiding unnecessary calculations. For example, we can calculate `ccw(s.p1, s.p2, t.p1)` and `ccw(s.p1, s.p2, t.p2)` only once instead of twice.

10. Optimize `intersectSP` function: The `intersectSP` function is used to check if a line segment and a point intersect. We can optimize this function by avoiding unnecessary calculations. For example, we can calculate `abs(s.p1 - p)` and `abs(s.p2 - p)` only once instead of twice.

11. Optimize `projection` function: The `projection` function is used to calculate the projection of a point onto a line. We can optimize this function by avoiding unnecessary calculations. For example, we can calculate `dot(p - l.p1, l.p1 - l.p2)` only once instead of twice.

12. Optimize `reflection` function: The `reflection` function is used to calculate the reflection of a point with respect to a line. We can optimize this function by avoiding unnecessary calculations. For example, we can calculate `projection(l, p)` only once instead of twice.

13. Optimize `distanceLP` function: The `distanceLP` function is used to calculate the distance between a line and a point. We can optimize this function by avoiding unnecessary calculations. For example, we can calculate `dot(p - projection(l, p), l.p1 - l.p2)` only once instead of twice.

14. Optimize `distanceLL` function: The `distanceLL` function is used to calculate the distance between two lines. We can optimize this function by avoiding unnecessary calculations. For example, we can calculate `intersectLL(l, m)` only once instead of twice.

15. Optimize `distanceLS` function: The `distanceLS` function is used to calculate the distance between a line and a line segment. We can optimize this function by avoiding unnecessary calculations. For example, we can calculate `intersectLS(l, s)` only once instead of twice.

16. Optimize `distanceSP` function: The `distanceSP` function is used to calculate the distance between a line segment and a point. We can optimize this function by avoiding unnecessary calculations. For example, we can calculate `projection(s, p)` only once instead of twice.

17. Optimize `distanceSS` function: The `distanceSS` function is used to calculate the distance between two line segments. We can optimize this function by avoiding unnecessary calculations. For example, we can calculate `intersectSS(s, t)` only once instead of twice.

18. Optimize `crosspoint` function: The `crosspoint` function is used to calculate the intersection point of two lines. We can optimize this function by avoiding unnecessary calculations. For example, we can calculate `cross(l.p2 - l.p1, m.p2 - m.p1)` and `cross(l.p2 - l.p1, l.p2 - m.p1)` only once instead of twice.
