Step 1: Remove unnecessary headers
- The program includes many unnecessary headers that are not used in the code. Removing these unnecessary headers will improve the compilation time and reduce memory usage.

Step 2: Simplify the loop condition in the main function
- The current loop condition in the main function is `while (~scanf("%d", &n))`. This is a bit confusing and can be simplified to `while (scanf("%d", &n) == 1)`.

Step 3: Optimize the nested loops
- The nested loops in the program can be optimized to reduce the number of iterations and improve performance. Currently, the program has three nested loops: `for (int i = 1; i * i <= n; i++)`, `for (int k = 1; k <= 4; k++)`, and `for (int j = i * i; j <= n; j++)`.
- The first nested loop can be modified to `for (int i = 1; i * i <= n; i++)` to eliminate unnecessary iterations. The loop will stop when `i * i` exceeds `n`.
- The second nested loop can be modified to `for (int k = 1; k <= 4 && k + i * i <= n; k++)` to eliminate unnecessary iterations. The loop will stop when `k + i * i` exceeds `n`.
- The third nested loop can be modified to `for (int j = i * i; j <= n; j++)` to eliminate unnecessary iterations. The loop will start from `i * i` instead of `1`.

Step 4: Optimize the memory usage
- The current program uses a 2D array `dp[1000000][5]` to store intermediate results. However, the maximum value of `n` is not specified, so this array may be too large and waste memory. We can optimize the memory usage by dynamically allocating the array based on the value of `n`.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#define _USE_MATH_DEFINES
#define INF 0x3f3f3f3f
#include <cstdio>
#include <cstring>

static const double EPS = 1e-8;

int main() {
  int n;
  while (scanf("%d", &n) == 1) {
    if (n == 0) {
      break;
    }
    int** dp = new int*[n + 1];
    for (int i = 0; i <= n; i++) {
      dp[i] = new int[5];
      memset(dp[i], 0, sizeof(int) * 5);
    }
    dp[0][0] = 1;
    for (int i = 1; i * i <= n; i++) {
      for (int k = 1; k <= 4 && k + i * i <= n; k++) {
        for (int j = i * i; j <= n; j++) {
          dp[j][k] += dp[j - i * i][k - 1];
        }
      }
    }
    printf("%d\n", dp[n][4] + dp[n][3] + dp[n][2] + dp[n][1]);
    for (int i = 0; i <= n; i++) {
      delete[] dp[i];
    }
    delete[] dp;
  }
}
```
