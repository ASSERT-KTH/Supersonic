Optimization step by step:

1. Remove unnecessary header files: The program includes several unnecessary header files, such as <bitset>, <deque>, <limits>, <list>, <map>, <queue>, <set>, <stack>, and <utility>. Since these header files are not used in the program, they can be removed.

2. Remove unnecessary typedefs: The program typedefs ll (long long) and P (pair<int, int>) but does not use them. These typedefs can be removed.

3. Optimize loop conditions: The innermost loop condition `j <= n` can be optimized by calculating the maximum value of `j` based on the current value of `i`. Instead of using `j <= n`, we can use `j <= n - i * i * (4 - k)` to avoid unnecessary iterations.

4. Optimize loop start value: The innermost loop starts from `j = i * i`, which can be optimized to start from `j = n - i * i * (4 - k)` to avoid unnecessary iterations.

5. Optimize loop end value: The middle loop condition `k <= 4` can be optimized to `k <= min(4, n - i * i + 1)` to avoid unnecessary iterations.

6. Reduce memory usage: The size of the `dp` array can be reduced by using a 2-dimensional array instead of a 2-dimensional array. Since the maximum value of `n` is given as `1000000`, the size of the `dp` array can be reduced to `[5]` instead of `[1000000][5]`.

7. Remove unnecessary header files: The program includes <cmath> and <cstdio> header files, but does not use any functions from these header files. These header files can be removed.

8. Use a more efficient method for input: The program uses `scanf` to read the input, which can be replaced with `cin` for a more efficient input method.

9. Use a more efficient method for output: The program uses `printf` to write the output, which can be replaced with `cout` for a more efficient output method.

Optimized program:

```c++
#define _USE_MATH_DEFINES
#define INF 0x3f3f3f3f
#include <algorithm>
#include <cstring>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;
static const double EPS = 1e-8;
int dp[5];
int main() {
  int n;
  while (cin >> n) {
    if (n == 0)
      break;
    memset(dp, 0, sizeof(dp));
    dp[0] = 1;
    for (int i = 1; i * i <= n; i++) {
      for (int k = 1; k <= min(4, n - i * i + 1); k++) {
        for (int j = n - i * i * (4 - k); j >= i * i; j--) {
          dp[k] += dp[j - i * i];
        }
      }
    }
    cout << dp[4] + dp[3] + dp[2] + dp[1] << endl;
  }
}
```
