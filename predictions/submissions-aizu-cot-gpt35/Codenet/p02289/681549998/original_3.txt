The given program implements a max heap data structure using an array. The main operations in the program are insert and extract. The insert operation inserts a new element into the max heap, while the extract operation removes and returns the maximum element from the heap.

To optimize the program, we can make the following changes:

1. Remove unnecessary headers: The program includes unnecessary headers such as `<algorithm>`, `<cstdio>`, and `<cstring>`. Since these headers are not used in the program, we can remove them to improve compilation time and reduce memory usage.

2. Remove unnecessary global variables: The program declares a global variable `H` and an array `A` with a size of `MAX + 1`. These variables are not used outside the main function, so we can move them inside the main function to reduce the scope of these variables and improve memory usage.

3. Replace `cin` with `scanf`: The program uses `cin` for input operations, which can be slower compared to `scanf`. By replacing `cin` with `scanf`, we can improve the input performance.

4. Optimize the extract function: The extract function removes and returns the maximum element from the heap. Currently, it uses recursion to restore the heap property after removing the element. We can optimize this function by using an iterative approach instead of recursion, which can reduce function call overhead and improve performance.

With these optimizations, the optimized program will have improved running time and reduced memory usage. Here's the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

#define MAX 2000000
#define INFTY (1 << 30)

int main() {
  int H = 0;
  int A[MAX + 1];

  auto maxHeap = [&](int i) {
    while (true) {
      int l = 2 * i;
      int r = 2 * i + 1;
      int large = i;
      if (l <= H && A[l] > A[i]) {
        large = l;
      }
      if (r <= H && A[r] > A[large]) {
        large = r;
      }
      if (large == i) {
        break;
      }
      swap(A[large], A[i]);
      i = large;
    }
  };

  auto extract = [&]() {
    if (H < 1) {
      return -INFTY;
    }
    int maxv = A[1];
    A[1] = A[H--];
    int i = 1;
    while (true) {
      int l = 2 * i;
      int r = 2 * i + 1;
      int large = i;
      if (l <= H && A[l] > A[i]) {
        large = l;
      }
      if (r <= H && A[r] > A[large]) {
        large = r;
      }
      if (large == i) {
        break;
      }
      swap(A[large], A[i]);
      i = large;
    }
    return maxv;
  };

  auto increasekey = [&](int i, int key) {
    if (key < A[i]) {
      return;
    }
    A[i] = key;
    while (i > 1 && A[i / 2] < A[i]) {
      swap(A[i], A[i / 2]);
      i = i / 2;
    }
  };

  auto insert = [&](int key) {
    H++;
    A[H] = -INFTY;
    increasekey(H, key);
  };

  char com[10];
  while (true) {
    scanf("%s", com);
    if (com[0] == 'e' && com[1] == 'n') {
      break;
    }
    if (com[0] == 'i') {
      int key;
      scanf("%d", &key);
      insert(key);
    } else {
      printf("%d\n", extract());
    }
  }

  return 0;
}
```

This optimized program improves running time by using an iterative approach in the extract and maxHeap functions instead of recursion. It also reduces memory usage by removing unnecessary global variables and headers. Additionally, it improves input performance by using `scanf` instead of `cin`.
