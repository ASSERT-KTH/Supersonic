The given program implements a max heap data structure using an array. The main operations performed on the heap are extract and insert.

To optimize the program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary headers: The program includes unnecessary headers such as `<algorithm>`, `<cstdio>`, and `<cstring>`. We can remove them as they are not used in the program.

2. Remove the `using namespace std;` statement: It is considered a good practice to avoid this statement in order to prevent namespace pollution. Instead, we can use the `std::` prefix when accessing standard library functions and types.

3. Replace the macro definitions with constant variables: Instead of using the `#define` macro to define `MAX` and `INFTY`, we can use constant variables. This is more readable and avoids potential issues with macro expansion.

4. Use a more efficient way to calculate `INFTY`: Instead of using `(1 << 30)` to calculate `INFTY`, we can use `INT_MAX` from the `<climits>` header, which represents the maximum value that can be stored in an `int` variable.

5. Pass variables by reference: In the `maxHeap` function, we can pass `i`, `l`, and `r` by reference instead of by value. This avoids unnecessary copying of these variables.

6. Avoid unnecessary swaps in `maxHeap`: In the `maxHeap` function, we can avoid swapping `A[large]` with `A[i]` if `large` is equal to `i`.

7. Use prefix increment and decrement operators: In the `maxHeap` function, we can use prefix increment and decrement operators (`++i` and `--H`) instead of postfix operators (`i++` and `H--`). This avoids creating temporary variables and improves performance.

8. Use a more efficient condition in the `increasekey` function: Instead of checking `key < A[i]` and returning early, we can use a single condition `if (key <= A[i])` to include the case when `key` is equal to `A[i]`.

9. Use a more efficient insertion in the `insert` function: Instead of setting `A[H] = -INFTY` and then calling `increasekey(H, key)`, we can directly set `A[H+1] = key` and call `increasekey(H+1, key)`.

10. Use `std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false)` to improve I/O performance: By default, `cin` and `cout` are synchronized with the C library's I/O functions. Disabling this synchronization can improve I/O performance.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <climits>

const int MAX = 2000000;
const int INFTY = INT_MAX;

int H, A[MAX + 1];

void maxHeap(int& i) {
  int& l = 2 * i;
  int& r = 2 * i + 1;
  int& large = (l <= H && A[l] > A[i]) ? l : i;
  if (r <= H && A[r] > A[large]) {
    large = r;
  }
  if (large != i) {
    std::swap(A[large], A[i]);
    maxHeap(large);
  }
}

int extract() {
  if (H < 1)
    return -INFTY;
  int maxv = A[1];
  A[1] = A[H--];
  maxHeap(1);
  return maxv;
}

void increasekey(int i, int key) {
  if (key <= A[i])
    return;
  A[i] = key;
  while (i > 1 && A[i / 2] < A[i]) {
    std::swap(A[i], A[i / 2]);
    i = i / 2;
  }
}

void insert(int key) {
  A[++H] = key;
  increasekey(H, key);
}

int main() {
  std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);

  int key;
  char com[10];
  while (1) {
    std::cin >> com;
    if (com[0] == 'e' && com[1] == 'n')
      break;
    if (com[0] == 'i') {
      std::cin >> key;
      insert(key);
    } else {
      std::cout << extract() << std::endl;
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```

The optimized code makes the mentioned modifications to improve the program's performance and memory usage.
