Optimization Steps:

1. Use a fixed-size array instead of dynamic allocation: The program is currently using a dynamic array `A` with a maximum size of `MAX + 1`. Since the maximum size is fixed and known at compile time, it is more efficient to use a fixed-size array.

2. Remove unnecessary includes: The program includes the `<algorithm>` and `<cstdio>` headers, but these are not used in the code. Removing unused includes can improve compilation time.

3. Use pass by reference instead of pass by value: The `increasekey` function takes the index `i` and key `key` as parameters. Instead of passing them by value, we can pass them by reference to avoid unnecessary copying.

4. Optimize the `maxHeap` function: The `maxHeap` function is used to maintain the heap property after an element is inserted or removed from the heap. Currently, it uses recursion to sift down the element to its correct position. We can optimize it by using a loop instead of recursion, which can reduce the function call overhead.
