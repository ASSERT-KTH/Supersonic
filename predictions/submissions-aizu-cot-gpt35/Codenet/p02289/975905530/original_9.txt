The given program reads a series of inputs from the user and performs two operations: "insert" and "pop_and_print". "insert" inserts an integer into a priority queue, while "pop_and_print" removes the highest priority element from the priority queue and prints it.

To optimize the program for running time and memory usage, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary header files: The program includes the header files `<limits.h>` and `<vector>`, but they are not used. We can remove them to reduce unnecessary overhead.

2. Avoid using `using namespace std;`: It is generally considered a good practice to avoid using `using namespace std;` in global scope, as it can lead to naming conflicts. We can remove this line and qualify the standard library types and functions with `std::` prefix.

3. Use `'\n'` instead of `std::endl`: The program uses `std::endl` to print a newline character (`'\n'`) and flush the output stream. However, flushing the output stream after every print operation can be costly in terms of performance. We can replace `std::endl` with `'\n'`, which will still print a newline character but will not flush the output stream.

4. Use a more efficient loop termination condition: The program uses `while (1)` as the loop termination condition, and breaks out of the loop when the user enters "end". Instead, we can use `while (true)`, which is more idiomatic and easier to understand.

5. Avoid unnecessary function parameter passing: The `pop_and_print` function takes a reference to the priority queue as a parameter. However, since we are not modifying the priority queue inside the function, we can remove the parameter and make the function operate on the global priority queue directly.

Based on these optimizations, here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>
#include <string>

int pop_and_print() {
  std::cout << qu.top() << '\n';
  qu.pop();
  return 0;
}

int main() {
  std::string s;
  int inp;
  std::priority_queue<int> qu;

  while (true) {
    std::cin >> s;
    if (s == "end") {
      break;
    } else if (s == "insert") {
      std::cin >> inp;
      qu.push(inp);
    } else {
      pop_and_print();
    }
  }

  return 0;
}
```
