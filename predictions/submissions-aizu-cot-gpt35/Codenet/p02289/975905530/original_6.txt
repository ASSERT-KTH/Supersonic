Optimization Steps:

1. Remove unnecessary headers: The `<limits.h>` header is not used in the program, so it can be removed.

2. Avoid using `using namespace std;`: It is considered a good practice to avoid using `using namespace std;` to prevent namespace clashes. Instead, you can use the `std::` prefix for the standard library classes and functions.

3. Use `'\n'` instead of `std::endl`: The `std::endl` flushes the output stream, which can be expensive. In most cases, using `'\n'` is sufficient and more efficient.

4. Use a more efficient way to check for the end condition: Instead of using `while (1)` to create an infinite loop, you can use `while (true)` which is more readable and standard. Alternatively, you can use a `do-while` loop to ensure that the loop body is executed at least once.

5. Avoid unnecessary function call: The `pop_and_print` function returns 0, which is not used in the program. You can remove the return statement and change the return type of the function to `void`.

6. Optimize input/output operations: Using `std::cin` and `std::cout` for input/output can be slower compared to other input/output methods. You can use `std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false)` to disable the synchronization between C and C++ input/output. This can significantly improve the program's performance.

7. Optimize memory usage: Instead of using a priority queue, which has a memory complexity of O(n), you can use a vector and sort it. This will reduce the memory usage to O(1). Since the priority queue is used only for popping the maximum element, using a vector with `std::sort` will have a similar effect.

Optimized Program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>
#include <string>
#include <vector>

void pop_and_print(std::vector<int>& vec) {
  std::cout << vec.back() << '\n';
  vec.pop_back();
}

int main() {
  std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);

  std::string s;
  int inp;
  std::vector<int> vec;

  do {
    std::cin >> s;
    if (s == "end") {
      break;
    } else if (s == "insert") {
      std::cin >> inp;
      vec.push_back(inp);
      std::sort(vec.begin(), vec.end(), std::greater<int>());
    } else {
      pop_and_print(vec);
    }
  } while (true);

  return 0;
}
```

Explanation:

1. Removed the `<limits.h>` header since it is not used in the program.

2. Removed the `using namespace std;` statement.

3. Replaced `std::endl` with `'\n'` to avoid unnecessary flushing of the output stream.

4. Replaced `while (1)` with `while (true)` for a more readable and standard infinite loop.

5. Changed the return type of `pop_and_print` function to `void` and removed the unnecessary return statement.

6. Added `std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false)` to disable the synchronization between C and C++ input/output.

7. Replaced the priority queue with a vector and sorted it using `std::sort` after each insertion. This allows us to efficiently pop the maximum element from the vector.
