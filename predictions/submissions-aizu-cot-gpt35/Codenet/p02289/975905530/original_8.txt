Step 1: Remove unnecessary includes
- The program includes `<limits.h>` and `<vector>` libraries, but they are not used in the code. We can remove them to improve compilation time.

Step 2: Remove unnecessary function return value
- The `pop_and_print` function has a return value of type `int`, but it is not used anywhere. We can remove the return statement to simplify the code.

Step 3: Remove unnecessary namespace usage
- The program uses `using namespace std;`, which can lead to naming conflicts and make the code harder to read. We can remove this line and use the `std::` prefix for the standard library functions and objects.

Step 4: Optimize input reading
- The current program uses `cin` to read input, which can be slow for large inputs. We can optimize this by using `std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false)` to disable the synchronization between C and C++ standard streams, which can improve the performance of input/output operations.

Step 5: Optimize output
- The current program uses `std::endl` to flush the output stream after each print. However, `std::endl` also inserts a newline character, which is not necessary in this case. We can replace it with `"\n"` to improve the performance.

Here is the optimized C++ program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>
#include <string>

int pop_and_print(std::priority_queue<int>& qu) {
  std::cout << qu.top() << "\n";
  qu.pop();
}

int main() {
  std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  
  std::string s;
  int inp;
  std::priority_queue<int> qu;
  
  while (true) {
    std::cin >> s;
    if (s == "end") {
      break;
    } else if (s == "insert") {
      std::cin >> inp;
      qu.push(inp);
    } else {
      pop_and_print(qu);
    }
  }
  
  return 0;
}
```
