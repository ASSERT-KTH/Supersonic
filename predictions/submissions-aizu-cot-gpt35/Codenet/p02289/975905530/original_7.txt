The given program reads a series of commands from the user. If the command is "insert", it reads an integer and inserts it into a priority queue. If the command is not "insert", it pops the top element from the priority queue and prints it.

To optimize the program for running time and memory usage, we can make the following changes:

1. Avoid unnecessary includes: The program includes the header files `<limits.h>`, `<queue>`, `<string>`, `<vector>`, which are not used. We can remove these unnecessary includes.

2. Avoid using `std` namespace: The program uses the `using namespace std;` statement, which brings all the names from the `std` namespace into the global namespace. This can lead to potential naming conflicts and make the code harder to read. We can remove this statement and use the `std::` prefix for the necessary names.

3. Use `'\n'` instead of `std::endl`: The program uses `std::endl` to end the line when printing. However, `std::endl` also flushes the output stream, which can be unnecessary and slow. We can use the `'\n'` character instead, which only ends the line without flushing the stream.

4. Use a more efficient loop condition: The program uses `while (1)` as the loop condition, which is an infinite loop that breaks when the command is "end". However, it would be more efficient to use a loop condition that directly checks for the "end" command, such as `while (s != "end")`.

5. Avoid unnecessary function return value: The function `pop_and_print` returns an `int` value, which is not used. We can remove the return statement and change the return type of the function to `void`.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>
#include <string>

void pop_and_print(std::priority_queue<int>& qu) {
  std::cout << qu.top() << '\n';
  qu.pop();
}

int main() {
  std::string s;
  int inp;
  std::priority_queue<int> qu;

  while (std::cin >> s && s != "end") {
    if (s == "insert") {
      std::cin >> inp;
      qu.push(inp);
    } else {
      pop_and_print(qu);
    }
  }

  return 0;
}
```
