Step 1: Remove unnecessary headers

The program includes the headers `<stdbool.h>`, `<stdio.h>`, and `<stdlib.h>`, but it does not use any functions or types from these headers. Therefore, we can remove these unnecessary headers to reduce the overhead.

Step 2: Optimize the loop

The loop in the `ope_line()` function iterates over the characters in the input, checking for specific patterns ('<' followed by '-') and ('-' followed by '>'). However, this can be simplified by using a single loop that reads two characters at a time.

Step 3: Optimize the train array initialization

The train array is initialized with NUL characters in every iteration of the loop. Instead of initializing the array each time, we can move the initialization outside the loop and use `memset` to set all elements to NUL.

Step 4: Optimize the train array access

The train array is accessed using indices t and s. Instead of accessing the array using indices, we can use pointers to reduce the overhead of array indexing.

Step 5: Optimize the printf statement

The printf statement can be optimized by using puts instead of printf to print the string. This avoids the need to specify a format string.

Here is the optimized program:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
const char NUL = '\0';

bool ope_line() {
  char train[52];
  char *t = &train[25];
  char *s = &train[25];

  memset(train, NUL, sizeof(train));

  int a = getchar();
  *t = a;

  while (a != '\n' && a != EOF) {
    int b = getchar();
    a = getchar();

    if (a == '<' && b == '-') {
      *--t = a;
      if (t < s)
        s = t;
    } else if (a == '-' && b == '>')
      *++t = a;
  }

  puts(s);

  return a != EOF;
}

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
  int n;
  scanf("%d\n", &n);

  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    if (!ope_line())
      break;
  }

  return 0;
}
```
