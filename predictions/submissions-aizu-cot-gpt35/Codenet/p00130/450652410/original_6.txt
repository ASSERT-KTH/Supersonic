To optimize the given program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Avoid using `getchar()` function multiple times for reading characters. Instead, we can read the entire line using `fgets()` function and then process the line character by character.

2. Remove the unnecessary initialization of the `train` array with NUL characters. Since we will be assigning values to the array elements immediately, there is no need to initialize it.

3. Instead of using `printf()` function with the `%s` format specifier, we can directly print the characters of the `train` array using a loop.

4. We can remove the `bool` return type of `ope_line()` function and directly use `void` return type since we are not using the return value in the `main()` function.

Here is the optimized program:

```c
#include <stdbool.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

void ope_line() {
  char train[52];
  int t = 25, s = 25;
  fgets(train, sizeof(train), stdin);

  for (int i = 0; train[i] != '\n' && train[i] != '\0'; i++) {
    if (train[i] == '<' && train[i+1] == '-') {
      train[--t] = train[i+2];
      if (t < s)
        s = t;
      i += 2;
    } else if (train[i] == '-' && train[i+1] == '>') {
      train[++t] = train[i+2];
      i += 2;
    }
  }

  for (int i = s; train[i] != '\n' && train[i] != '\0'; i++) {
    putchar(train[i]);
  }
  putchar('\n');
}

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
  int n;
  scanf("%d\n", &n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    ope_line();
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Explanation of optimization steps:

1. We replace the multiple `getchar()` calls with `fgets()` to read the entire line at once. This reduces the number of function calls and improves performance.

2. We remove the unnecessary initialization of the `train` array with NUL characters since we will be assigning values to it immediately.

3. We modify the logic inside the loop to process the line character by character. This eliminates the need for multiple `getchar()` calls and simplifies the code.

4. We change the return type of `ope_line()` function from `bool` to `void` since we are not using the return value in the `main()` function. This improves code readability.
