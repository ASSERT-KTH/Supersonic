Step 1: Remove unnecessary header files
- The program does not use any functions or types from the `stdbool.h` and `stdlib.h` header files. Therefore, we can remove these includes.

Step 2: Remove unnecessary variable initialization
- The variable `train` is initialized with null characters in a loop, but this is not necessary since each element of the array will be assigned a value later. We can remove the loop that initializes `train`.

Step 3: Remove unused variable
- The variable `b` is assigned a value but is never used. We can remove this variable declaration and assignment.

Step 4: Optimize the loop condition
- The original loop condition `a != '\n' && a != EOF` checks for the end of input by comparing the input character with the newline character (`'\n'`) and the end-of-file character (`EOF`). However, we can simplify the condition by checking for the newline character only. This is because `getchar()` returns `EOF` when there is no more input, so we don't need to explicitly check for it.

Step 5: Optimize the array indexing
- The original program uses two variables `t` and `s` to keep track of the current position in the train array. However, we can simplify the logic by using a single variable `pos` to represent the current position. This variable can be incremented or decremented directly, without the need for extra checks and assignments. Additionally, we can eliminate the `s` variable and use `pos` directly to print the result.

Step 6: Use `puts` instead of `printf`
- Instead of using `printf` with a format string to print a single string, we can use the `puts` function, which is more efficient for this purpose.

Here is the optimized C/C++ program:

```cpp
#include <stdio.h>

const char NUL = '\0';

bool ope_line() {
  char train[52];
  int pos = 25;

  char c = getchar();
  train[pos] = c;
  char a = getchar();

  while (a != '\n') {
    char c = getchar();

    if (a == '<') {
      --pos;
    } else if (a == '-') {
      ++pos;
    }

    train[pos] = c;
    a = getchar();
  }

  puts(&train[pos]);

  return (a != EOF);
}

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
  int n;
  scanf("%d\n", &n);

  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    if (!ope_line()) {
      break;
    }
  }

  return 0;
}
```
