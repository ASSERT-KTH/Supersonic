The given program reads a series of train cars and their connections from the input, and then prints the train starting from the specified position.

To optimize this program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove the unnecessary inclusion of `<stdbool.h>` and `<stdlib.h>`. These headers are not used in the code.

2. Change the declaration of the `NUL` constant from `const char` to `const char*`. This allows us to assign a null pointer value to it, which will be useful later.

3. Instead of initializing the `train` array with null characters in a loop, we can use the `memset` function from `<string.h>` to set all elements to null.

4. Instead of repeatedly calling `getchar()` to read characters, we can use one `scanf()` call to read the entire line of input. This will be more efficient.

5. Instead of using an array of characters to represent the train, we can use a dynamically allocated string. This will save memory and simplify the code.

6. Instead of printing the substring of the train using `printf()`, we can directly print the substring using `puts()`. This will be more efficient.

7. Instead of using a boolean return type for the `ope_line()` function, we can change it to `void`. The main function can handle the terminating condition based on the return value of `scanf()`.

Here is the optimized program:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

const char* NUL = NULL;

void ope_line() {
  char* train = malloc(52 * sizeof(char));
  int t = 25, s = 25;
  memset(train, 0, 52 * sizeof(char));

  int n;
  scanf("%d ", &n);

  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    char a, b, c;
    scanf("%c%c%c", &a, &b, &c);

    if (a == '<' && b == '-') {
      train[--t] = c;
      if (t < s)
        s = t;
    } else if (a == '-' && b == '>')
      train[++t] = c;
  }

  puts(&train[s]);
  free(train);
}

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
  while (1) {
    if (scanf("%d\n", &n) != 1)
      break;
    ope_line();
  }

  return 0;
}
```
