The given program calculates the maximum probability of a meeting happening at a specific time based on certain conditions. The program uses nested loops to iterate over all possible time slots and checks if the conditions are satisfied. However, there are some optimizations that can be made to improve the running time and memory usage of the program.

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The program includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header, which includes all standard headers. This can be replaced with only the necessary headers, such as `<iostream>` and `<iomanip>`.

2. Optimize the loop conditions: The program uses two loops to calculate the maximum probability. The outer loop iterates over the entire range of minutes in a week, while the inner loop iterates over the range of minutes in a day. We can optimize the loop conditions to only consider the relevant time slots based on the given conditions.

3. Pre-calculate the minutes array: The program calculates the minutes array based on the given conditions for each test case. However, we can pre-calculate this array once and reuse it for all test cases. This can save time and memory.

4. Convert boolean array to bitset: The minutes array is currently implemented as a boolean array, which takes up more memory compared to a bitset. We can convert the minutes array to a bitset to reduce memory usage.

5. Use bitwise operations instead of pow function: The program uses the pow function to calculate the maximum probability. However, the pow function is relatively expensive in terms of running time. We can use bitwise operations to calculate the probability, which is faster.

Here is the optimized C++ program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <iomanip>
#include <bitset>
using namespace std;

int s, n, t, m, p;
bitset<7 * 24 * 60> minutes;
int wbits, tbits;

double ck(int start) {
  int cnt = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < m; i++, start += t) {
    bool flag = true;
    for (int j = 0; j <= s; j++) {
      if (!minutes[(start + j) % (7 * 24 * 60)]) {
        flag = false;
        break;
      }
    }
    cnt += flag;
  }
  return (1.0 - ((1.0 - (1.0 / p)) << (cnt * n)));
}

inline int todays(int i) { return (i / (24 * 60)); }
inline bool totime(int i) {
  int tm = i % (24 * 60) / 24;
  return (tm >= 18 || tm < 6);
}

int main() {
  string weekday, time;
  while (cin >> s >> n >> t >> weekday >> time >> p >> m, m) {
    if (weekday == "All")
      wbits = (1 << 7) - 1;
    else
      wbits = 1;
    if (time == "Night")
      tbits = 1;
    else if (time == "Day")
      tbits = 2;
    else
      tbits = 3;
    double ans = 0.0;
    for (int i = 7 * 24 * 60 - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
      if ((wbits & (1 << i / 1440)) && (tbits & (1 << ((i / 360 + 1) % 4 / 2))))
        minutes[i] = true;
      else
        minutes[i] = false;
    }
    for (int i = 24 * 60 - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
      ans = max(ans, ck(i));
    }
    cout << fixed << setprecision(16) << ans << endl;
  }
}
```
