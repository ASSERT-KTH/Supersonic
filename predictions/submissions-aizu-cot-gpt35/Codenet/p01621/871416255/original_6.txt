The given program calculates the maximum value of a function `ck` for a given set of input parameters. The `ck` function iterates over a range of values for `start` and counts the number of valid intervals based on the `minutes` array. The program then calculates the value of the function using the count and other input parameters.

To optimize the program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` includes a large number of standard library headers, which can increase compilation time and memory usage. We can remove this line and only include the necessary headers.

2. Use a more efficient data structure for the `minutes` array: The `minutes` array is currently implemented as a boolean array, which requires a lot of memory. We can use a bitset instead, which would significantly reduce memory usage.

3. Optimize the `ck` function: The `ck` function currently iterates over a range of values for `start` and checks the validity of intervals by iterating over another range. We can optimize this by calculating the count of valid intervals in a single loop, without the need for nested loops.

4. Use more efficient bitwise operations: The program uses bitwise operations to set and check bits in the `wbits` and `tbits` variables. We can optimize these operations by using more efficient bitwise operations.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <iomanip>
#include <bitset>
using namespace std;

int s, n, t, m, p;
bitset<7 * 24 * 60> minutes;
int wbits, tbits;

double ck(int start) {
  int cnt = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < m * t; i++) {
    if (!minutes[(start + i) % (7 * 24 * 60)]) {
      cnt = 0;
      break;
    }
    cnt++;
  }
  return (1.0 - pow(1.0 - 1.0 / p, (double)cnt * n));
}

inline int todays(int i) {
  return (i / (24 * 60));
}

inline bool totime(int i) {
  int tm = i % (24 * 60) / 24;
  return (tm >= 18 || tm < 6);
}

int main() {
  string weekday, time;
  while (cin >> s >> n >> t >> weekday >> time >> p >> m, m) {
    if (weekday == "All")
      wbits = (1 << 7) - 1;
    else
      wbits = 1;
    if (time == "Night")
      tbits = 1;
    else if (time == "Day")
      tbits = 2;
    else
      tbits = 3;
    double ans = 0.0;

    for (int i = 0; i < 7 * 24 * 60; i++) {
      if ((wbits & (1 << todays(i))) && (tbits & (1 << ((i / 360 + 1) % 4 / 2))))
        minutes[i] = true;
      else
        minutes[i] = false;
    }

    for (int i = 0; i < 24 * 60; i++) {
      ans = max(ans, ck(i));
    }

    cout << fixed << setprecision(16) << ans << endl;
  }
}
```

Explanation of optimizations:

1. Removed unnecessary includes: The `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` line was removed and only the necessary headers were included.

2. Used `bitset` for `minutes` array: Replaced the `bool` array with a `bitset` to reduce memory usage.

3. Optimized `ck` function: Instead of iterating over `m` intervals and checking the `minutes` array for each interval, the optimized version calculates the count of valid intervals in a single loop. It checks the validity of each minute within the interval and increments the count accordingly. If an invalid minute is found, the count is reset to zero. This avoids the need for nested loops and improves performance.

4. Used more efficient bitwise operations: The program now uses the `todays` function to calculate the index of the `wbits` array. It also uses a combination of bitwise shift and bitwise AND operations to set and check the bits in `wbits` and `tbits`. This helps in optimizing the bitwise operations.
