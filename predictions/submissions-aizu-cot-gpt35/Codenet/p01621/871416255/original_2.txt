Step 1: Eliminate unnecessary includes
The program includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header, which is not necessary. We can remove it.

Step 2: Optimize the `ck` function
The `ck` function calculates the number of consecutive minutes that satisfy a certain condition. It can be optimized by iterating through the minutes and counting the number of consecutive minutes that satisfy the condition. This can be done by keeping track of the current count of consecutive minutes and resetting it whenever a minute does not satisfy the condition.

Step 3: Optimize the `main` function
The `main` function can be optimized by removing unnecessary code and simplifying the logic. We can remove the unnecessary `wbits` and `tbits` variables and directly use their values in the loop conditions.

Here is the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <iomanip>
#include <cmath>
using namespace std;
int s, n, t, m, p;
bool minutes[7 * 24 * 60];

double ck(int start) {
  int cnt = 0;
  int consecutive_minutes = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < m; i++, start += t) {
    consecutive_minutes = (minutes[start] ? consecutive_minutes + 1 : 0);
    if (consecutive_minutes >= s + 1) {
      cnt++;
      consecutive_minutes = 0;
    }
  }
  return (1.0 - pow(1.0 - 1.0 / p, (double)cnt * n));
}

int main() {
  string weekday, time;
  while (cin >> s >> n >> t >> weekday >> time >> p >> m, m) {
    double ans = 0.0;
    for (int i = 7 * 24 * 60 - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
      if ((weekday == "All" || i % 1440 / 360 == 6) && (time == "Night" || (i % 1440 / 360 + 1) % 4 / 2 == 1)) {
        minutes[i] = true;
      } else {
        minutes[i] = false;
      }
    }
    for (int i = 24 * 60 - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
      ans = max(ans, ck(i));
    }
    cout << fixed << setprecision(16) << ans << endl;
  }
}
```
