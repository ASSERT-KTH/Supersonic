To optimize the given program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary header inclusion: The program includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header, which is not standard and can be replaced with the necessary standard headers.

2. Use a more efficient data structure for the `minutes` array: The `minutes` array is currently implemented as a boolean array. However, we can optimize it by using a bitset instead. This will reduce the memory usage and improve the performance.

3. Use a more efficient loop structure: The outer loop in the `ck` function iterates `m` times, and the inner loop iterates `s` times. Instead of using two nested loops, we can calculate the value of `cnt` directly using mathematical formulas. This will eliminate the need for the inner loop and improve the performance.

4. Remove unnecessary calculations: The `todays` and `totime` functions are not used in the program. We can remove them to simplify the code.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <bitset>
#include <iomanip>
#include <cmath>

using namespace std;

int s, n, t, m, p;
bitset<7 * 24 * 60> minutes;
int wbits, tbits;

double ck(int start) {
  int cnt = 0;
  int interval = s + 1;
  int total_intervals = (m - 1) * t + interval;
  int total_minutes = 7 * 24 * 60;
  cnt = (total_minutes - total_intervals) / t + 1;
  return (1.0 - pow(1.0 - 1.0 / p, (double)cnt * n));
}

int main() {
  string weekday, time;
  while (cin >> s >> n >> t >> weekday >> time >> p >> m, m) {
    if (weekday == "All")
      wbits = (1 << 7) - 1;
    else
      wbits = 1;
    if (time == "Night")
      tbits = 1;
    else if (time == "Day")
      tbits = 2;
    else
      tbits = 3;
    double ans = 0.0;
    for (int i = 7 * 24 * 60 - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
      if ((wbits & (1 << i / 1440)) && (tbits & (1 << ((i / 360 + 1) % 4 / 2))))
        minutes[i] = true;
      else
        minutes[i] = false;
    }
    for (int i = 24 * 60 - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
      ans = max(ans, ck(i));
    }
    cout << fixed << setprecision(16) << ans << endl;
  }
}
```

Explanation of the optimization:

1. Removed the unnecessary header inclusion of `<bits/stdc++.h>` and replaced it with the necessary standard headers.

2. Replaced the `minutes` array with a `bitset<7 * 24 * 60>` to optimize memory usage and improve performance.

3. Modified the `ck` function to calculate the value of `cnt` directly using mathematical formulas, eliminating the need for the inner loop. This improves the performance.

4. Removed the unused `todays` and `totime` functions to simplify the code.

These optimizations should improve the running time and memory usage of the program.
