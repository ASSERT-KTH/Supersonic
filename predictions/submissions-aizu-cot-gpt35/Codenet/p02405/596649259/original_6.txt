The given program prints a checkerboard pattern of dots and hashes based on the input height (H) and width (W). It uses nested loops to iterate over the rows and columns of the checkerboard, and uses the expression `(i + j) % 2 == 0` to determine whether to print a dot or a hash at each position.

To optimize the program for running time and memory usage, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove the `using namespace std;` directive and explicitly qualify the `cin` and `cout` objects with the `std::` namespace to avoid namespace pollution.

2. Instead of using a nested loop to iterate over the rows and columns of the checkerboard, we can use a single loop that iterates from 1 to `H*W` and calculate the row and column indices based on the loop variable.

3. Instead of using the expression `(i + j) % 2 == 0` to determine the character to print, we can use a ternary operator (`condition ? value_if_true : value_if_false`) to directly select the dot or hash character based on the loop variable.

Here is the optimized C++ program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  int H, W;
  std::cin >> H >> W;

  while (H != 0 && W != 0) {
    for (int k = 1; k <= H * W; k++) {
      int i = (k - 1) / W + 1;
      int j = (k - 1) % W + 1;
      
      std::cout << (k % 2 == 0 ? '#' : '.') << (j == W ? '\n' : '');
    }
    
    std::cout << '\n';
    std::cin >> H >> W;
  }

  return 0;
}
```

This optimized program eliminates the need for nested loops and reduces the number of calculations inside the loop. It directly calculates the row and column indices using integer division and modulus operations. It also uses a ternary operator to select the dot or hash character based on the loop variable.
