The given program appears to be a code that prints a checkerboard pattern of dots and hash symbols based on the given input values of H (height) and W (width). The program uses nested loops to iterate through each row and column to determine whether to print a dot or a hash symbol based on the parity of the row and column indices.

To optimize the program for running time and memory usage, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove the unnecessary `using namespace std;` directive, as it can lead to naming conflicts.

2. Instead of using a modulo operation `(i + j) % 2` to determine the parity of the row and column indices, we can simplify the logic by using a bitwise AND operation `((i ^ j) & 1)`. This operation takes the XOR of `i` and `j` and checks if the least significant bit is set, which determines the parity.

3. Instead of using the `cout` object to print each character individually, we can store the characters in a string and print the entire string at once using `cout`.

4. Instead of printing a new line character `cout << endl;` at the end of each row, we can append a newline character to the string after each row is constructed.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
int main() {
  int H, W;
  std::cin >> H >> W;
  while (H != 0 && W != 0) {
    std::string pattern;
    for (int i = 1; i <= H; i++) {
      for (int j = 1; j <= W; j++) {
        pattern += ".#"[(i ^ j) & 1];
      }
      pattern += '\n';
    }
    std::cout << pattern << std::endl;
    std::cin >> H >> W;
  }
  return 0;
}
```

In this optimized version, we store the pattern of characters in a `std::string` called `pattern` and append the characters and newline character to the string within the inner loop. Then, we print the entire `pattern` string using `std::cout` at once. This reduces the number of output operations and improves performance.
