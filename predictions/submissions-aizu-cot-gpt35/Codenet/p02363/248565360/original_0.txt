Step 1: Remove unnecessary header files
The program includes the `<string>` header file, but it is not used in the code. Therefore, we can remove it to improve compilation time and reduce memory usage.

Step 2: Remove unused variables
The variable `update` is used to track whether any updates were made during each iteration of the Bellman-Ford algorithm. However, it is not used outside the loop and can be removed. Removing unused variables can improve code readability and reduce memory usage.

Step 3: Change the data type of `d` array
The `d` array is used to store the minimum distances from the start vertex to each vertex. It is currently declared as an array of type `int`. However, the `__INT_MAX__` value is used as a sentinel value to represent infinity. This means that the actual maximum value of the distances cannot be stored in the `int` data type. We can change the data type of `d` to `long long` to handle larger values.

Step 4: Use reserve() function for vector
The `edges` vector is used to store the edges of the graph. It is initially empty and grows dynamically as edges are added. However, we know the number of edges in advance (`eNum`), so we can use the `reserve()` function to allocate memory for the vector before adding edges. This can reduce memory reallocations and improve performance.

Step 5: Avoid unnecessary string concatenation
The `ans` string is used to store the output of the program. In each iteration of the outer loop, the result for each vertex is appended to the `ans` string using the `append()` function. However, concatenating strings in a loop can be inefficient due to repeated memory allocations and copying. We can improve the performance by using a `stringstream` to build the output string and then assign it to `ans` at the end.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <sstream>
using namespace std;

#define MAX 100000

struct edge {
  int s, t, d;
};

vector<edge> edges;
string ans;
long long d[MAX];

int BellmanFord(int startVertex, int vNum, int eNum) {
  fill(d, d + MAX, LLONG_MAX);
  d[startVertex] = 0;

  for (int i = 0; i < vNum; ++i) {
    for (int j = 0; j < eNum; ++j) {
      edge e = edges[j];
      if (d[e.s] != LLONG_MAX && d[e.t] > d[e.s] + e.d) {
        d[e.t] = d[e.s] + e.d;
        if (i == vNum - 1) {
          cout << "NEGATIVE CYCLE" << endl;
          return -1;
        }
      }
    }
  }

  stringstream ss;
  for (int i = 0; i < vNum; ++i) {
    if (i > 0)
      ss << " ";
    if (d[i] == LLONG_MAX) {
      ss << "INF";
    } else {
      ss << d[i];
    }
  }

  ans = ss.str();
  return 0;
}

int main() {
  int vNum, eNum;
  cin >> vNum >> eNum;

  int s, t, w;
  edges.reserve(eNum);
  for (int i = 0; i < eNum; ++i) {
    cin >> s >> t >> w;
    edges.push_back({s, t, w});
  }

  for (int i = 0; i < vNum; ++i) {
    if (BellmanFord(i, vNum, eNum) == -1) {
      return 0;
    }
    ans.append("\n");
  }

  cout << ans;
}
```
