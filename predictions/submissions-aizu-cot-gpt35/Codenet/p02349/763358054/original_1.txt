The given program is using a Fenwick Tree (also known as Binary Indexed Tree) to perform range updates and point queries. A Fenwick Tree is a data structure that allows efficient updates and queries on an array.

To optimize the program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The program includes `<bits/stdc++.h>` which is not necessary and can be removed.

2. Remove unnecessary typedef: The program typedefs `long long` to `ll` which is not necessary and can be removed.

3. Use a more appropriate data type for `n` and `q`: The program uses `int` for `n` and `q`, but it is more appropriate to use `long long` since the constraints allow for larger values.

4. Use a more appropriate data type for `ans`: The program uses `int` for `ans`, but it is more appropriate to use `long long` since the sum of `S[i]` values can exceed the range of `int`.

5. Use `vector` instead of array for `S`: The program uses an array `S` to store the Fenwick Tree values, but it is more efficient to use a `vector` since it can dynamically resize and handle the updates and queries more efficiently.

6. Preallocate memory for the `vector` `S`: Instead of resizing `S` inside the loop, we can preallocate the memory for `S` based on the value of `n` before the loop.

7. Use `scanf` and `printf` instead of `cin` and `cout`: The program uses `cin` and `cout` for input and output, but `scanf` and `printf` are faster and can improve the running time.

8. Remove unnecessary loop variable: The program uses the same loop variable `i` in the outer and inner loop, which can be confusing. We can use different loop variables to make the code more readable.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <cstdio>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  long long n, q;
  scanf("%lld %lld", &n, &q);

  vector<long long> S(n + 1, 0);

  for (long long j = 0; j < q; j++) {
    bool op;
    scanf("%d", &op);

    if (op) {
      long long k;
      scanf("%lld", &k);

      long long ans = 0;
      for (long long i = k; i > 0; i -= i & -i)
        ans += S[i];

      printf("%lld\n", ans);
    } else {
      long long s, t, x;
      scanf("%lld %lld %lld", &s, &t, &x);

      for (long long i = s; i <= n; i += i & -i)
        S[i] += x;

      for (long long i = t + 1; i <= n; i += i & -i)
        S[i] += -x;
    }
  }

  return 0;
}
