The given program is a C++ program that solves a sliding puzzle problem using breadth-first search (BFS). The program reads input from the user, performs the BFS algorithm to find the minimum number of steps to solve the puzzle, and then prints the result.

To optimize this program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Avoid unnecessary includes: The program includes several unnecessary headers such as `<algorithm>`, `<functional>`, `<set>`, and `<string>`. Since these headers are not used in the program, we can remove them to reduce unnecessary compilation time and memory usage.

2. Optimize the use of `std::bitset`: The program uses a `std::bitset` named `vis` to keep track of visited states. The size of the `bitset` is set to `80000000`, which is much larger than necessary. We can optimize the memory usage by reducing the size of the `bitset` to the maximum possible number of states, which is `10000000` (since there are only `8! = 40320` possible states). This reduces the memory usage by a factor of 8.

3. Optimize the use of `std::string` and conversion functions: The program uses `std::string` to store the puzzle state and uses `atoi` and manual string manipulation to convert between `char` and `int`. We can optimize this by directly working with integers instead of strings. This reduces the overhead of string manipulation and conversion functions.

4. Avoid unnecessary iterations: The program uses two nested loops to convert an integer to a character array and vice versa. We can avoid one of these loops by using arithmetic operations instead of string manipulation.

5. Avoid unnecessary checks and operations: The program checks for special cases where swapping two elements may lead to an invalid state. We can avoid these checks by ensuring that the loop only iterates over valid indices.

6. Optimize input reading: The program uses `scanf` to read input characters one by one, which can be slow. We can optimize this by using a single `scanf` call to read the entire puzzle state.

Based on these optimizations, here is the modified and optimized C++ program:

```cpp
#include <stdio.h>
#include <bitset>

struct pt {
  int ztt;
  int lwz;
  int step;
};

pt dl[1 << 16];
int front = 1, back = 1;
int tt;
int ddd[8] = {10000000, 1000000, 100000, 10000, 1000, 100, 10, 1};

void bfs() {
  tt = 0;
  front = 1;
  back = 1;
  int bs = 0;
  std::bitset<10000000> vis;
  vis.reset();

  int cs;
  scanf("%d", &cs);
  vis[cs] = 1;
  pt lsss;
  lsss.ztt = cs;
  lsss.lwz = cs % 10;
  lsss.step = 0;
  dl[back] = lsss;
  back++;

  while (front < back) {
    pt ls1 = dl[front];
    front++;

    if (ls1.ztt == 1234567) {
      bs = ls1.step;
      tt = 1;
      return;
    }

    pt lsjr;
    int kkk[4] = {-1, 1, -4, 4};
    int tt = ls1.ztt;

    for (int i = 7; i >= 0; i--) {
      int digit = tt % 10;
      lsjr.ztt += digit * ddd[i];
      tt /= 10;
    }

    for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
      lsjr.lwz = ls1.lwz + kkk[i];

      if (lsjr.lwz >= 0 && lsjr.lwz <= 7) {
        int t = (lsjr.ztt / ddd[lsjr.lwz]) % 10;
        lsjr.ztt -= t * ddd[lsjr.lwz];
        lsjr.ztt += t * ddd[ls1.lwz];
        lsjr.step = ls1.step + 1;

        if (!vis[lsjr.ztt]) {
          vis[lsjr.ztt] = 1;
          dl[back] = lsjr;
          back++;
        }
      }
    }
  }
}

int main() {
  while (1) {
    int bj;
    if (scanf("%d", &bj) == EOF) {
      return 0;
    }

    bfs();

    if (tt) {
      printf("%d\n", bs);
    } else {
      printf("-1\n");
    }

    while (getchar() != '\n')
      ;
  }

  return 0;
}
```

This optimized program reduces unnecessary memory usage, eliminates unnecessary conversions, and improves the efficiency of input reading.
