The given program is a C++ program that solves a puzzle problem using a breadth-first search algorithm. The optimization steps for the program are as follows:

1. Remove unnecessary header files: The program includes several unnecessary header files such as `<algorithm>`, `<functional>`, `<set>`, `<string>`, and `<vector>`. Since these header files are not used in the program, they can be removed to improve compilation time and reduce memory usage.

2. Use a more efficient data structure for `vis` array: The `vis` array is used to mark visited states in the puzzle. Currently, it is implemented as an array of characters. However, since the array size is fixed at `80000000 / 8`, it can be implemented more efficiently using a bitset data structure. This will reduce the memory usage significantly.

3. Replace `atoi` with a custom conversion function: The program uses the `atoi` function to convert the input string `bj` to an integer. However, `atoi` is a slow and unsafe function. It can be replaced with a custom conversion function that converts the string to an integer more efficiently.

4. Optimize the loop conditions: In the `for` loop inside the `bfs` function, the loop condition `i < 4` can be optimized to `i != 4`. This will eliminate the need for the comparison operation inside the loop.

5. Optimize the loop increment: Instead of using the post-increment operator `front++` and `back++` to increment the loop variables `front` and `back`, the pre-increment operator `++front` and `++back` can be used. This is more efficient as it avoids the creation of a temporary copy of the variable.

With these optimizations, the optimized program is as follows:

```cpp
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <bitset>

char zzzt[8] = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7};
char bj[8];
std::bitset<80000000> vis;
#define ck(x) (vis[(x)])
#define sb(x) (vis[(x)] = true)
#define cb(x) (vis[(x)] = false)
struct pt {
  int ztt;
  int lwz;
  int step;
};
int bs;
pt dl[1 << 16];
int front = 1, back = 1;
int tt;
int ddd[8] = {10000000, 1000000, 100000, 10000, 1000, 100, 10, 1};

void bfs() {
  tt = 0;
  front = 1;
  back = 1;
  bs = 0;
  vis.reset();
  int cs = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < 8; i++) {
    cs = cs * 10 + bj[i] - '0';
  }
  sb(cs);
  pt lsss;
  lsss.ztt = cs;
  lsss.lwz = strchr(bj, '0') - bj;
  lsss.step = 0;
  dl[back++] = lsss;
  while (front != back) {
    pt ls1 = dl[front++];
    if (ls1.ztt == 1234567) {
      bs = ls1.step;
      tt = 1;
      return;
    }
    pt lsjr;
    int kkk[4] = {-1, 1, -4, 4};
    for (int i = 0; i != 4; i++) {
      lsjr.lwz = ls1.lwz + kkk[i];
      if ((ls1.lwz == 3 && lsjr.lwz == 4) || (ls1.lwz == 4 && lsjr.lwz == 3))
        continue;
      if (lsjr.lwz >= 0 && lsjr.lwz <= 7) {
        int a, b;
        a = ls1.ztt / ddd[ls1.lwz] % 10;
        b = ls1.ztt / ddd[lsjr.lwz] % 10;
        lsjr.ztt = ls1.ztt + (b - a) * ddd[ls1.lwz] + (a - b) * ddd[lsjr.lwz];
        if (!ck(lsjr.ztt)) {
          lsjr.step = ls1.step + 1;
          sb(lsjr.ztt);
          dl[back++] = lsjr;
        }
      }
    }
  }
}

int main() {
  while (1) {
    if (scanf("%c", &bj[0]) == EOF) {
      return 0;
    }
    scanf("%*c");
    for (int i = 1; i <= 6; i++) {
      scanf("%c%*c", &bj[i]);
    }
    scanf("%c", &bj[7]);
    bfs();
    if (tt) {
      printf("%d\n", bs);
    } else {
      printf("-1\n");
    }
    while (getchar() != '\n')
      ;
  }
  return 0;
}
```

These optimizations should improve the running time and memory usage of the program.
