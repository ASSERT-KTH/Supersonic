The given program is an implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm for finding the shortest path in a graph. Here are the steps to optimize the program:

1. Remove the unnecessary global constants: The program defines several global constants such as `MAX`, `INFTY`, `WHITE`, `GRAY`, and `BLACK`. These constants are only used within the `dijkstra` function and can be moved inside the function.

2. Pass the necessary variables by reference: Currently, the `dijkstra` function modifies the `d` and `color` arrays by value. To improve performance, these arrays can be passed by reference to avoid unnecessary copying of data.

3. Use a priority queue for selecting the minimum distance vertex: The current implementation uses a linear search to find the vertex with the minimum distance. This can be improved by using a priority queue (e.g., a min-heap) to efficiently select the vertex with the minimum distance. This change will significantly reduce the running time of the algorithm.

4. Avoid unnecessary checks in the inner loop: The inner loop checks whether `color[v] != BLACK` and `M[u][v] != INFTY` before updating the distance. However, these checks are unnecessary because the algorithm guarantees that `color[v]` will not be `BLACK` and `M[u][v]` will not be `INFTY` if the condition is true.

5. Optimize the memory usage: The program currently uses a 2D matrix `M` to represent the graph, which has a fixed size of `MAX x MAX`. This leads to unnecessary memory usage when the actual graph has a smaller size. To optimize memory usage, we can dynamically allocate the memory for the graph using the actual size `n` instead of `MAX`.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
using namespace std;

void dijkstra(int n, vector<vector<int>>& M) {
  static const int INFTY = (1 << 21);
  static const int WHITE = 0;
  static const int GRAY = 1;
  static const int BLACK = 2;

  vector<int> d(n, INFTY);
  vector<int> color(n, WHITE);
  d[0] = 0;
  color[0] = GRAY;

  priority_queue<pair<int, int>, vector<pair<int, int>>, greater<pair<int, int>>> pq;
  pq.push({0, 0});

  while (!pq.empty()) {
    int u = pq.top().second;
    pq.pop();

    if (color[u] == BLACK)
      continue;

    color[u] = BLACK;

    for (int v = 0; v < n; v++) {
      int weight = M[u][v];
      if (weight != INFTY && d[v] > d[u] + weight) {
        d[v] = d[u] + weight;
        color[v] = GRAY;
        pq.push({d[v], v});
      }
    }
  }

  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cout << i << " " << (d[i] == INFTY ? -1 : d[i]) << endl;
  }
}

int main() {
  int n;
  cin >> n;

  vector<vector<int>> M(n, vector<int>(n, (1 << 21)));

  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    int u, k;
    cin >> u >> k;

    for (int j = 0; j < k; j++) {
      int v, c;
      cin >> v >> c;
      M[u][v] = c;
    }
  }

  dijkstra(n, M);

  return 0;
}
```

In this optimized version, we have moved the constants `INFTY`, `WHITE`, `GRAY`, and `BLACK` inside the `dijkstra` function. We have also passed the variables `n` and `M` by reference to the `dijkstra` function instead of using global variables. Additionally, we have used a priority queue to efficiently select the vertex with the minimum distance. Finally, we have dynamically allocated the memory for the graph using the actual size `n`. These optimizations will improve the running time and reduce memory usage.
