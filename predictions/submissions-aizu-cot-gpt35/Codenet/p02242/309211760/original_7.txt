Step 1: Remove unnecessary global constants

The program defines several global constants that are not used. We can remove them to simplify the code.

Step 2: Optimize memory allocation

The program uses a 2D array `M[MAX][MAX]` to represent a graph. However, the size of the array is fixed at `MAX`, which might be larger than the actual number of vertices in the graph. This wastes memory. We can optimize the memory allocation by dynamically allocating the array based on the input size `n`.

Step 3: Optimize the inner loop

The inner loop in the `dijkstra` function iterates over all vertices to find the vertex with the minimum distance. This can be optimized by using a priority queue to store the vertices, where the vertex with the minimum distance is always at the front of the queue. This way, we can avoid the linear search in the inner loop.

Step 4: Return the optimized program

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

void dijkstra() {
  int n;
  cin >> n;

  vector<vector<int>> M(n, vector<int>(n, INT_MAX));
  
  int k, c, u, v;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> u >> k;
    for (int j = 0; j < k; j++) {
      cin >> v >> c;
      M[u][v] = c;
    }
  }

  vector<int> d(n, INT_MAX);
  vector<int> color(n, 0);
  d[0] = 0;
  color[0] = 1;

  priority_queue<pair<int, int>, vector<pair<int, int>>, greater<pair<int, int>>> pq;
  pq.push({0, 0});

  while (!pq.empty()) {
    int u = pq.top().second;
    pq.pop();

    if (color[u] == 2)
      continue;

    color[u] = 2;

    for (int v = 0; v < n; v++) {
      if (color[v] == 0 && M[u][v] != INT_MAX) {
        if (d[v] > d[u] + M[u][v]) {
          d[v] = d[u] + M[u][v];
          color[v] = 1;
          pq.push({d[v], v});
        }
      }
    }
  }

  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cout << i << " " << (d[i] == INT_MAX ? -1 : d[i]) << endl;
  }
}

int main() {
  dijkstra();
  return 0;
}
```

Explanation of the optimization steps:

1. The unnecessary global constants `MAX`, `INFTY`, `WHITE`, and `GRAY` are removed.

2. The memory allocation for the `M` array is optimized by using a dynamically allocated vector of vectors. The size is determined by the input `n`.

3. The inner loop in the `dijkstra` function is optimized by using a priority queue `pq` to store the vertices. The priority queue is sorted based on the distance, so the vertex with the minimum distance is always at the front. This allows us to avoid the linear search in the inner loop.

4. The main function is simplified to just call the `dijkstra` function.
