The given program is a C++ program that implements Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path in a graph. The program first reads the number of vertices and edges from the input, and then reads the edges and their weights. After that, it runs Dijkstra's algorithm and prints the shortest path distances from the source vertex to all other vertices.

To optimize this program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Use `std::vector` instead of dynamically allocated arrays: Instead of using raw arrays for the adjacency matrix and visited array, we can use `std::vector` which provides better memory management and bounds checking.

2. Initialize the adjacency matrix with `INFINIT` value: Instead of using `std::fill_n` to set all elements of the adjacency matrix to `INFINIT`, we can use `std::vector` constructor to initialize the matrix with the desired value.

3. Use a priority queue for finding the minimum distance vertex: Instead of iterating over all vertices to find the minimum distance vertex, we can use a priority queue to efficiently find the vertex with the minimum distance.

Here's the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <cstdio>
#include <queue>
#include <vector>

using uint = unsigned int;

class Graph {
  const uint n_;
  std::vector<uint> g_;
  const uint INFINIT;

public:
  Graph(uint n)
      : n_(n), g_((n_ * n_), INFINIT), INFINIT(100000 * (n_ - 1) + 1) {}

  uint *operator[](uint i) { return &g_[(n_ * i)]; }

  void dijkstra(uint *dist) {
    std::fill_n(dist, n_, INFINIT);
    std::vector<bool> visited(n_, false);
    auto i = 0u;
    visited[i] = true;
    dist[i] = 0u;

    struct Vertex {
      uint index;
      uint distance;

      bool operator<(const Vertex &other) const {
        return distance > other.distance;
      }
    };

    std::priority_queue<Vertex> pq;
    pq.push({i, dist[i]});

    while (!pq.empty()) {
      auto current = pq.top();
      pq.pop();

      if (visited[current.index])
        continue;

      visited[current.index] = true;
      dist[current.index] = current.distance;

      auto es = (*this)[current.index];
      for (auto j = 0u; j < n_; ++j) {
        if (visited[j])
          continue;

        auto new_distance = current.distance + es[j];
        if (new_distance < dist[j]) {
          dist[j] = new_distance;
          pq.push({j, new_distance});
        }
      }
    }
  }
};

int main() {
  uint n;
  std::scanf("%u", &n);
  Graph g(n);
  uint u, k, c, v;
  for (auto i = 0u; i < n; ++i) {
    std::scanf("%u %u", &u, &k);
    for (auto j = 0u; j < k; ++j) {
      std::scanf("%u %u", &c, &v);
      g[u][c] = v;
    }
  }
  std::vector<uint> dist(n);
  g.dijkstra(dist.data());
  for (auto i = 0u; i < n; ++i) {
    std::printf("%u %u\n", i, dist[i]);
  }
}
```

Explanation of the optimizations:

1. Used `std::vector` for adjacency matrix and visited array: By using `std::vector` instead of raw arrays, we don't need to manually manage memory and bounds checking. The vectors are initialized with the desired sizes and values.

2. Used a priority queue for finding the minimum distance vertex: Instead of iterating over all vertices to find the minimum distance vertex, we use a priority queue (`std::priority_queue`) to efficiently get the vertex with the minimum distance. The vertices are stored in the queue with their distances, and the queue is sorted based on the distances in descending order.

3. Modified the `operator<` for the `Vertex` struct: The `Vertex` struct is used to store the vertex index and its distance. The comparison operator `<` is modified to compare the distances in descending order, so that the minimum distance vertex is always at the top of the priority queue.

These optimizations improve the running time and memory usage of the program by using more efficient data structures and algorithms.
