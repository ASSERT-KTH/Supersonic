The given program reads 28 integers from the input and inserts them into a set. Then, it iterates from 1 to 30 and checks if each number is present in the set. If a number is not present, it prints it to the output.

To optimize this program, we can make the following modifications:

1. We can remove the unnecessary inclusion of the entire `<bits/stdc++.h>` library, which is not standard and may slow down compilation.
2. We can remove the unnecessary `using namespace std;` directive, which can lead to naming conflicts and makes the code less clear.
3. Instead of inserting the numbers into a set and then checking if each number is present, we can use a boolean array to mark the presence of each number.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using std::cin;
using std::cout;
using std::endl;

int main() {
  bool present[31] = {false};
  int n;
  for (int i = 0; i < 28; i++) {
    cin >> n;
    present[n] = true;
  }
  for (int i = 1; i <= 30; i++) {
    if (!present[i])
      cout << i << endl;
  }
}
```

Explanation:
1. We include only the necessary `<iostream>` header for input/output operations.
2. We use the `std::cin`, `std::cout`, and `std::endl` to explicitly specify the standard input/output streams.
3. We replace the `set<int> data` with a boolean array `present[31]`, where `present[i]` represents whether the number `i` is present or not.
4. Instead of inserting the numbers into a set, we directly mark the presence of each number in the boolean array by setting `present[n] = true`.
5. We iterate from 1 to 30 and check if each number is present in the boolean array using `if (!present[i])`. If a number is not present, we print it to the output using `cout`.

These modifications optimize the program by eliminating the overhead of inserting elements into a set and checking for presence using `count()` function. Instead, we use a simple boolean array that requires less memory and provides constant-time lookup for presence.
