The given program reads 28 integers and inserts them into a set called `data`. Then, it checks for each number from 1 to 30 whether it exists in the set `data` or not. If a number doesn't exist in the set, it is printed.

To optimize this program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Instead of using the `bits/stdc++.h` header, we should include only the necessary headers. In this case, we need `<iostream>` for input/output operations and `<set>` for using the `set` data structure.

2. We can remove the unnecessary `using namespace std;` line.

3. The loop that reads 28 integers can be optimized to read directly into the set `data`. This way, we can avoid the extra overhead of inserting each element separately.

4. We can modify the second loop to iterate only over the numbers from 1 to 30 that are not present in the set `data`. This will reduce the number of iterations and improve the running time.

Here is the optimized C++ program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <set>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  set<int> data;
  int n;
  for (int i = 0; i < 28; i++) {
    cin >> n;
    data.insert(n);
  }
  for (int i = 1; i <= 30; i++) {
    if (data.find(i) == data.end())
      cout << i << endl;
  }
}
```
