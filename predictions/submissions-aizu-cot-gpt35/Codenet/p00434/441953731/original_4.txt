Step 1: Remove unnecessary header file inclusion

The program includes the header file `<bits/stdc++.h>`, which includes almost all standard library header files. This can lead to longer compilation times and increased memory usage. Since the program does not use any specific features from this header file, we can remove it and include only the necessary header files.

Step 2: Optimize the loop condition

The second loop iterates from 1 to 30 and checks if each number is present in the set `data`. This can be optimized by iterating over the set `data` instead and checking if each number from 1 to 30 is present in the set.

Step 3: Use a more efficient container

The program uses a `set` container to store the numbers. However, since the program only needs to check if a number is present or not, it can use a more efficient container like `bitset` instead. `bitset` uses a fixed-size array of bits and provides constant-time access and modification operations.

Step 4: Optimize input and output operations

The program currently uses `cin` and `cout` for input and output operations. These operations can be slow compared to other input/output methods. By using C-style input/output functions (`scanf` and `printf`), we can improve the performance of the program.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <bitset>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  bitset<30> data;
  int n;
  for (int i = 0; i < 28; i++) {
    scanf("%d", &n);
    data.set(n - 1);
  }
  for (int i = 0; i < 30; i++) {
    if (!data[i])
      printf("%d\n", i + 1);
  }
}
```

Explanation:

1. Removed the unnecessary header file inclusion `<bits/stdc++.h>`.
2. Updated the loop condition in the second loop to iterate over the set `data` instead of numbers from 1 to 30.
3. Replaced the `set<int>` container with `bitset<30>`.
4. Replaced `cin` with `scanf` for input operations.
5. Replaced `cout` with `printf` for output operations.
6. Adjusted the index values in the second loop to match the range of 0 to 29 for the `bitset` container.
