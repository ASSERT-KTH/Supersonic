The given program reads 28 integers from input and stores them in a set. Then, it checks for numbers in the range 1 to 30 that are not present in the set and prints them.

To optimize this program, we can modify the second loop to iterate only till 30 instead of 1 to 30. This way, we don't need to check for the presence of all numbers in the range. Additionally, we can improve the memory usage by using a boolean array to keep track of the presence of numbers instead of using a set.

Here's the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  bool present[31] = {false};
  int n;
  
  for (int i = 0; i < 28; i++) {
    cin >> n;
    present[n] = true;
  }
  
  for (int i = 1; i <= 30; i++) {
    if (!present[i])
      cout << i << endl;
  }
}
```

In the optimized program, we use a boolean array `present` of size 31 to keep track of the presence of numbers. The array is initialized with `false`. During the first loop, we set `present[n]` to `true` for each input number `n`. Then, in the second loop, we simply check the value of `present[i]` to determine if `i` is present or not.
