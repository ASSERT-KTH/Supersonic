The given program reads 28 integers from the standard input and inserts them into a set. Then it iterates from 1 to 30 and checks if each number is present in the set. If a number is not present, it is printed to the standard output.

To optimize this program, we can make the following improvements:

1. Remove the unnecessary inclusion of the entire `bits/stdc++.h` library. Instead, include only the necessary headers (`iostream` and `set`).

2. Change the type of the set from `set<int>` to `bitset<30>`. This will allow us to represent the presence or absence of each number in a more memory-efficient way.

3. Instead of inserting each number into the set, we can directly set the corresponding bit in the `bitset` to indicate its presence.

4. Instead of iterating from 1 to 30 and checking each number individually, we can use the `bitset`'s `test` function to check if a bit is set or not.

5. Print the missing numbers directly without using the `endl` and instead use a newline character `\n`.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <bitset>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  bitset<30> data;
  int n;
  for (int i = 0; i < 28; i++) {
    cin >> n;
    data[n - 1] = 1;
  }
  for (int i = 0; i < 30; i++) {
    if (!data.test(i))
      cout << i + 1 << '\n';
  }
}
```
