Step 1: Remove unnecessary header file inclusion.
The `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` includes a large number of standard C++ library headers, which can slow down the compilation process. Since we are not using any specific headers from this inclusion, we can remove it.

Step 2: Use a more efficient data structure.
The current solution uses a `set` to store the numbers. However, since we are dealing with a small range of values (1 to 30), we can use a `bool` array or a `bitset` to represent the presence or absence of a number. This will reduce the memory usage and improve the running time of the program.

Step 3: Optimize the loop conditions.
The first loop runs for a fixed number of iterations (28), so we can use a constant value instead of a variable. Similarly, the second loop can be optimized by using the `data` set size instead of iterating up to 30.

Step 4: Use more efficient output method.
The current program uses `cout` to print each missing number individually. Instead, we can build a string with all the missing numbers and print it in one go. This will reduce the number of system calls and improve the running time.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <bitset>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  bitset<30> data;
  int n;
  for (int i = 0; i < 28; i++) {
    cin >> n;
    data.set(n - 1);
  }

  string missingNumbers;
  for (int i = 0; i < 30; i++) {
    if (!data.test(i))
      missingNumbers += to_string(i + 1) + "\n";
  }

  cout << missingNumbers;

  return 0;
}
```
