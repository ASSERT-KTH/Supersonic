This program reads 28 integers from the input and stores them in a set. Then it checks for the numbers between 1 and 30 that are not present in the set and prints them.

To optimize this program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Instead of using the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header file, we can include only the necessary header files. In this case, we need `iostream` for input/output operations and `set` for the set data structure.

2. We can remove the `using namespace std` line and explicitly use the `std::` prefix for the standard library functions and data types. This helps avoid any potential conflicts between different namespaces.

3. Instead of reading the integers one by one in a loop, we can read all 28 integers at once using a `vector`. This reduces the number of input operations and improves efficiency.

4. We can use a `bitset` instead of a `set` to store the presence of each number. This reduces memory usage and improves performance for this specific case where we only have numbers between 1 and 30.

5. Instead of iterating over the numbers from 1 to 30 and checking their presence in the set, we can iterate over the numbers in the `bitset` and print the ones that are not present.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <bitset>
#include <vector>

int main() {
  std::vector<int> data(28);
  for (int i = 0; i < 28; i++) {
    std::cin >> data[i];
  }

  std::bitset<30> presence;
  for (int num : data) {
    presence.set(num - 1);
  }

  for (int i = 0; i < 30; i++) {
    if (!presence[i]) {
      std::cout << i + 1 << std::endl;
    }
  }

  return 0;
}
```
