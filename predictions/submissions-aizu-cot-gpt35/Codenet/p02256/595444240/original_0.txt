The given program calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm. To optimize this program, we can eliminate the unnecessary variable `i` and modify the logic of the `while` loop.

Here is the optimized program:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  int a, b;
  scanf("%d%d", &a, &b);
  
  while (b != 0) {
    int temp = b;
    b = a % b;
    a = temp;
  }
  
  printf("%d\n", a);
}
```

Explanation of the optimization steps:

1. Removed the unnecessary variable `c` and `i`, as they are not being used in the program.
2. Modified the condition of the `while` loop from `c > 0` to `b != 0`. This change avoids unnecessary calculations and reduces the number of iterations.
3. Introduced a new temporary variable `temp` to store the value of `b` before it gets updated. This change allows us to correctly update the values of `a` and `b` without losing the original value of `b`.

Overall, these optimizations improve the running time and memory usage of the program by reducing unnecessary calculations and eliminating unused variables.
