The given program calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm. To optimize this program, we can make the following improvements:

1. Remove the unnecessary variable `i` as it is not being used.
2. Instead of initializing `c` with `1`, we can initialize it with the modulo operation `c = a % b`.
3. Use a `do-while` loop instead of a `while` loop. This way, we can eliminate the initial check `c > 0` and reduce the number of conditional checks.

Here is the optimized version of the program:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  int a, b, c;
  scanf("%d%d", &a, &b);
  
  do {
    c = a % b;
    a = b;
    b = c;
  } while (c);
  
  printf("%d\n", a);
}
```
