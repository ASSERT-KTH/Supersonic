Step 1: Remove unnecessary variable initialization
- The variable `i` is declared but not used in the program. We can remove it to improve readability.

Step 2: Optimize the loop condition
- Currently, the loop condition `c > 0` is used to check if `c` is greater than 0 for every iteration. However, we can optimize this by changing the loop condition to `c != 0` which will have the same effect but is more concise.

Step 3: Optimize variable assignments
- Currently, the values of `a` and `b` are swapped using a temporary variable `c`. We can optimize this by using the XOR bitwise operation to swap the values without using a temporary variable. This can improve the performance of the program.

Here is the optimized C program:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  int a, b, c = 1;
  scanf("%d%d", &a, &b);

  while (c != 0) {
    c = a % b;
    a ^= b;
    b ^= a;
    a ^= b;
  }

  printf("%d\n", a);
  return 0;
}
```
