The given program calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm. To optimize the program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove the unnecessary variable `i` as it is not used in the program.
2. Instead of using a `while` loop, we can use a `do-while` loop to ensure that the loop is executed at least once. This eliminates the need to initialize `c` to a non-zero value before the loop.
3. Remove the `scanf` statement for input and replace it with command-line arguments to pass the values of `a` and `b` directly to the program.

Here is the optimized program:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
  int a = atoi(argv[1]);
  int b = atoi(argv[2]);
  int c;

  do {
    c = a % b;
    a = b;
    b = c;
  } while (c > 0);

  printf("%d\n", a);
}
```

In the optimized program, the values of `a` and `b` are passed as command-line arguments to the `main` function. The `atoi` function is used to convert the command-line arguments from strings to integers. The `do-while` loop is used to calculate the GCD. The final GCD is then printed using `printf`.
