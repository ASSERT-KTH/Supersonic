This program calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm. The algorithm iteratively divides the larger number by the smaller number and assigns the remainder to the larger number, until the remainder becomes zero. The final value of the larger number is the GCD of the two numbers.

To optimize this program, we can make the following changes:

1. Remove the unnecessary variable `i` since it is not used in the program.

2. Replace the `printf` statement with a more efficient `puts` function, which is optimized for printing a single line of text.

3. Use a do-while loop instead of a while loop to eliminate the need for an initial check for `c > 0`.

4. Combine the input and calculation steps to avoid unnecessary variable assignments.

Here is the optimized program:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  int a, b, c;
  scanf("%d%d", &a, &b);
  
  do {
    c = a % b;
    a = b;
    b = c;
  } while (c != 0);

  puts("GCD:");
  printf("%d\n", a);
}
```
