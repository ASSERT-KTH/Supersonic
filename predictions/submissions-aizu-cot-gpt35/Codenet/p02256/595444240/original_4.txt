The given program is finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers `a` and `b` using the Euclidean algorithm. 

To optimize this program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove the unnecessary variable `i` as it is not used in the program.
2. Instead of initializing `c` to 1, we can directly assign `c = a % b` before entering the `while` loop.
3. Remove the `c = a % b;` line from inside the `while` loop.
4. Print the result directly without using a separate variable.

Here is the optimized program:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  int a, b, c;

  scanf("%d%d", &a, &b);

  c = a % b;
  while (c > 0) {
    a = b;
    b = c;
    c = a % b;
  }

  printf("%d\n", b);
}
```
