The given program calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers using the Euclidean algorithm. 

To optimize the program for running time and memory usage, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove the unused variable `i`.
2. Combine the initialization of variables `a` and `b` with the `scanf` statement.
3. Use a `do-while` loop instead of a `while` loop to avoid redundant calculations.

Here is the optimized version of the program:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  int a, b, c;
  scanf("%d%d", &a, &b);
  
  do {
    c = a % b;
    a = b;
    b = c;
  } while (c > 0);
  
  printf("%d\n", a);
}
```
