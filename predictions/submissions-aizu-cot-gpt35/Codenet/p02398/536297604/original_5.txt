The given program calculates the number of integers in the range from `a` to `b` (inclusive) that divide `c` evenly. 

To optimize this program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Initialize the variable `t` to 0 before the loop. Currently, `t` is not initialized and can contain garbage value.

2. Instead of iterating from `a` to `b` and checking if `c` is divisible by each number, we can iterate from `a` to the smallest number `d` such that `d * c > b`. This will reduce the number of iterations and improve performance.

3. Use the modulo operator `%` to check if `c` is divisible by `s` instead of using the equality operator `==`. This will avoid unnecessary division operation.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  int a, b, c, s, t = 0;
  cin >> a >> b >> c;

  for (s = a; s * c <= b; s++) {
    if (c % s == 0) {
      t++;
    }
  }

  cout << t << endl;
  return 0;
}
```
