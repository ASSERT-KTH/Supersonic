The given program calculates the number of integers between `a` and `b` (inclusive) that divide `c` evenly. 

To optimize this program, we can make the following modifications:
1. Initialize `t` to 0 before the loop starts to avoid undefined behavior.
2. Instead of iterating from `a` to `b` and checking if each number divides `c` evenly, we can iterate from `a` to the square root of `c` and check if both `s` and `c/s` divide `c` evenly. This reduces the number of iterations and improves the running time.
3. We can also add an additional check to skip the iteration if `s` is greater than `b` to further reduce unnecessary iterations.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int a, b, c, s, t = 0;
  cin >> a >> b >> c;
  
  int sqrt_c = sqrt(c);
  
  for (s = a; s <= sqrt_c; s++) {
    if (c % s == 0) {
      t++;
      if (s != c / s && s <= b) {
        t++;
      }
    }
  }
  
  cout << t << endl;
  return 0;
}
```
