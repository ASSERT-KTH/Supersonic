The given program calculates the number of integers between `a` and `b` (inclusive) that divide `c` evenly. 

To optimize the program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Initialize `t` to 0 before the loop starts. This ensures that `t` is always initialized to a known value.
2. We can avoid the loop entirely if `a` is greater than `c` or `b` is less than `c`. In this case, the result will be 0. So we can add a check at the beginning to handle this case.
3. We can optimize the loop by starting from `s = c` instead of `s = a`. This is because any number less than `c` cannot divide `c` evenly.
4. The loop can be optimized further by checking only the numbers that are less than or equal to the square root of `c`. This is because if `c` is divisible by a number greater than its square root, then it must also be divisible by a smaller number.
5. We can increment `t` by 2 instead of 1, because if `s` divides `c` evenly, then `c/s` will also divide `c` evenly. This reduces the number of iterations in the loop.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int a, b, c, s, t = 0;
  cin >> a >> b >> c;

  if (a > c || b < c) {
    cout << t << endl;
    return 0;
  }

  int sqrt_c = sqrt(c);
  for (s = c; s <= b && s <= sqrt_c; s++) {
    if (c % s == 0) {
      t += 2;
    }
  }
  
  if (s <= b && s * s == c) {
    t++;
  }

  cout << t << endl;
  return 0;
}
```

With these optimizations, the program will run faster by reducing unnecessary iterations in the loop and handling the special cases more efficiently.
