The given program calculates the number of integers in the range [a, b] that divide c evenly. 

To optimize this program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Initialize the variable `t` to 0 before the loop starts. This ensures that `t` starts with a known value.

2. Instead of using a loop to iterate through each integer in the range [a, b], we can calculate the number of integers that divide `c` evenly by checking the divisors of `c` itself.

3. We can reduce the search space for divisors by only checking integers up to the square root of `c`. This is because if `x` is a divisor of `c`, then `c/x` is also a divisor. So, we only need to check up to the square root of `c` to find all divisors.

4. We can count the number of divisors by incrementing `t` whenever we find a divisor.

Here is the optimized C++ program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int a, b, c, t = 0;
  cin >> a >> b >> c;
  
  // Reduce the search space for divisors up to sqrt(c)
  int sqrt_c = sqrt(c);
  
  for (int s = a; s <= b; s++) {
    if (c % s == 0) {
      t++;
      
      // Check the other divisor c/s
      if (s != c/s) {
        t++;
      }
    }
  }
  
  cout << t << endl;
  return 0;
}
```
