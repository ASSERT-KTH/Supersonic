The given program calculates the number of integers in the range [a, b] that divide the number c without any remainder. 

To optimize this program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Initialize the variable `t` to 0 before the loop starts. This ensures that `t` starts with the correct value.

2. Instead of checking each integer in the range [a, b], we can check only the divisors of `c` within that range. This will reduce the number of iterations in the loop and improve the running time.

3. We can also optimize the loop by starting from the smallest divisor of `c` within the range [a, b] and incrementing by that divisor in each iteration. This will ensure that we only check the divisors of `c` and skip unnecessary iterations.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int a, b, c, s, t;
  cin >> a >> b >> c;
  
  t = 0; // Initialize t to 0
  
  // Find the smallest divisor of c within the range [a, b]
  s = (a % c == 0) ? a : (a + c - (a % c)); 
  
  // Iterate over the divisors of c within the range [a, b]
  for (; s <= b; s += c) {
    t++;
  }
  
  cout << t << endl;
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized program reduces the number of iterations in the loop and only checks the divisors of `c` within the range [a, b], resulting in improved running time.
