The main bottleneck in the given program is the depth-first search (DFS) function `dfs()`. This function is called recursively for each unvisited node in the graph. However, the current implementation of the DFS function has some inefficiencies that can be optimized.

1. **Avoid unnecessary calculations**: Inside the `dfs()` function, the `maxi` and `num` variables are used to keep track of the maximum value and the number of occurrences of the maximum value in the path. However, these variables are recalculated for each recursive call, even if the node being visited is already visited. We can optimize this by moving the calculation of `maxi` and `num` inside the if statement where the node is not visited.

2. **Improve loop condition**: The current implementation has a loop that iterates twice for each node. However, we only need to iterate once because `b[0][now]` and `b[1][now]` represent the two adjacent nodes for the given node. We can modify the loop condition to `for (int i = 0; i < 1; i++)` to iterate only once.

3. **Optimize return statements**: The current implementation has a return statement inside the loop that immediately returns the result if a specific condition is met. However, this return statement is not correctly positioned because it should only return after checking both adjacent nodes. We can fix this by moving the return statement outside the loop, after checking both adjacent nodes.

Here's the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

const int MAXN = 100100;
const int MOD = 10007;

int n, b[2][MAXN], f[2][MAXN];
bool v[MAXN];

int dfs(int s, int now, int maxi, int num) {
  v[now] = true;
  int newMaxi = maxi;
  int newNum = num;
  for (int i = 0; i < 1; i++) { // Iterate only once
    if (!v[b[i][now]]) {
      if (maxi == f[i][now])
        newNum++;
      else if (maxi < f[i][now]) {
        newMaxi = f[i][now];
        newNum = 1;
      }
      int result = dfs(s, b[i][now], newMaxi, newNum); // Recursively call dfs
      if (b[i][now] == s)
        return result;
    }
  }
  if (maxi == f[1][s])
    return num + 1;
  else if (maxi < f[1][s])
    return 1;
  else
    return num;
}

int main() {
  while (cin >> n, n) {
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      cin >> b[0][i] >> f[0][i] >> b[1][i] >> f[1][i];
      v[i] = false;
    }
    int ans = 1;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      if (!v[i]) {
        v[i] = true;
        ans = (ans * dfs(i, b[0][i], f[0][i], 1)) % MOD;
      }
    }
    cout << ans << endl;
  }
}
```

The optimizations made in this optimized program will reduce the unnecessary calculations and improve the overall performance of the program.
