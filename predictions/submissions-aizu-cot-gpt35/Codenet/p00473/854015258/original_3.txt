The given program is using dynamic programming to solve a problem. It initializes a 3D array `dp` with dimensions 2 x 5002 x 2 and then iterates over the values of `n` to fill in the array. Finally, it prints the minimum value from the array.

To optimize the program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove the unnecessary `using namespace std;` directive. This is considered a bad practice and can lead to name collisions.

2. Remove the `static` keyword from the declaration of the `dp` array. Since the array is already defined inside a function, it doesn't need to be declared as static.

3. Change the `scanf` and `printf` functions to the corresponding `cin` and `cout` statements. The `scanf` and `printf` functions have a slower input/output performance compared to `cin` and `cout`.

4. Change the `min` function to a ternary operator. The ternary operator `?:` is faster than calling the `min` function.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using std::cin;
using std::cout;

const int INF = 1000000000;

int main() {
  int n, c;
  int dp[2][5002][2];
  
  for (int i = 0; i < 2; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j < 5002; j++) {
      dp[i][j][0] = INF;
      dp[i][j][1] = INF;
    }
  }
  
  dp[1][1][0] = 0;
  dp[1][0][1] = 0;
  
  cin >> n;
  
  for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
    int s = i % 2;
    int t = 1 - s;
    
    cin >> c;
    
    for (int j = 0; j <= n / 2; j++) {
      if (j == 0) {
        dp[s][j][0] = INF;
      } else {
        dp[s][j][0] = dp[t][j - 1][0] < dp[t][j - 1][1] + c ? dp[t][j - 1][0] : dp[t][j - 1][1] + c;
      }
      
      dp[s][j][1] = dp[t][j][0] + c < dp[t][j][1] ? dp[t][j][0] + c : dp[t][j][1];
    }
  }
  
  cout << (dp[0][n / 2][0] < dp[0][n / 2][1] ? dp[0][n / 2][0] : dp[0][n / 2][1]) << "\n";
}
```

These modifications should improve the running time and memory usage of the program.
