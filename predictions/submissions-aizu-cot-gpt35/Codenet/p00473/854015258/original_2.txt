Step 1: Remove unnecessary includes and using namespace std

The program includes the <iostream> header and uses the "std" namespace, but it doesn't actually use any features from <iostream> and doesn't need the "std" namespace. Therefore, we can remove these lines to reduce unnecessary overhead.

Step 2: Optimize the initialization of dp array

The dp array is initialized with a large value (INF) for each element. However, we can optimize this initialization by using a memset function call to set all the elements to INF in a more efficient way.

Step 3: Optimize the loop conditions

The loop conditions in the nested for loops can be optimized to reduce unnecessary iterations. For example, the second loop can be changed to iterate up to n/2 instead of 5002, as the dp array size is limited by n/2.

Step 4: Use printf instead of scanf

The program uses scanf to read input, but we can use printf and scanf together to reduce overhead. By using printf and scanf together, we can avoid the need to include the <cstdio> header, which is necessary for using scanf alone.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <cstdio>

int main() {
  const int INF = 1000000000;
  int n, c;
  static int dp[2][5000 + 2][2];

  memset(dp, INF, sizeof(dp));

  dp[1][1][0] = 0;
  dp[1][0][1] = 0;

  scanf("%d", &n);

  for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
    int s = i % 2, t = 1 - s;
    scanf("%d", &c);
    for (int j = 0; j <= n / 2; j++) {
      if (j == 0)
        dp[s][j][0] = INF;
      else
        dp[s][j][0] = std::min(dp[t][j - 1][0], dp[t][j - 1][1] + c);
      dp[s][j][1] = std::min(dp[t][j][0] + c, dp[t][j][1]);
    }
  }

  printf("%d\n", std::min(dp[0][n / 2][0], dp[0][n / 2][1]));

  return 0;
}
```
