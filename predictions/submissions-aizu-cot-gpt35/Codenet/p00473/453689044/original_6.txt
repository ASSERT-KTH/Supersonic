The given program is using a dynamic programming approach to solve a problem. It is using a 2D array `dp` to store the minimum cost at each step. However, there are a few optimizations that can be made to improve the performance of the program:

1. Avoid unnecessary memory operations: The program is using two 2D arrays `dp` and `tmp` to store the minimum cost values. Instead of copying the values from `dp` to `tmp` at the end of each iteration, we can swap the pointers of `dp` and `tmp` to avoid the memory operation.

2. Reduce the number of iterations: The outer loop in the `solve()` function is iterating from 1 to `n-1`, which means it is executing `n-1` times. However, the `tmp` array is initialized with `tmp[1][0]` and `tmp[0][1]` as 0, so we can start the outer loop from 2 and reduce the number of iterations by 1.

3. Avoid unnecessary calculations: The `minCost` function is comparing two values and returning the minimum. However, we can simplify this by using the `std::min` function from the `<algorithm>` header.

Now, let's apply these optimizations and generate the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <cstdio>
#include <cstring>
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

int n;
int t[10002];
int dp[5002][2], tmp[5002][2];

int solve() {
  memset(tmp, -1, sizeof(tmp));
  tmp[1][0] = tmp[0][1] = 0;

  for (int i = 2; i < n; i++) {
    memset(dp, -1, sizeof(dp));
    
    for (int j = 0; j <= n / 2; j++) {
      for (int pre = 0; pre < 2; pre++) {
        if (tmp[j][pre] == -1)
          continue;
        for (int next = 0; next < 2; next++) {
          if (pre == next) {
            if (next == 0)
              dp[j + 1][next] = min(dp[j + 1][next], tmp[j][pre]);
            else
              dp[j][next] = min(dp[j][next], tmp[j][pre]);
          } else {
            if (next == 0)
              dp[j + 1][next] = min(dp[j + 1][next], tmp[j][pre] + t[i - 1]);
            else
              dp[j][next] = min(dp[j][next], tmp[j][pre] + t[i - 1]);
          }
        }
      }
    }
    swap(dp, tmp);
  }
  
  return min(dp[n / 2][0], dp[n / 2][1]);
}

int main() {
  scanf("%d", &n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
    scanf("%d", &t[i]);
  }
  printf("%d\n", solve());
}
```

This optimized code reduces the number of iterations in the outer loop by 1, avoids unnecessary memory operations, and uses `std::min` for comparing values. These optimizations should improve the running time and memory usage of the program.
