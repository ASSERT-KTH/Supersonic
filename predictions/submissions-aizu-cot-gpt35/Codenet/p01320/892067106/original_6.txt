The given program is a solution to a problem that involves finding the smallest enclosing circle that contains a given set of line segments. The program uses geometric algorithms and data structures to solve the problem.

To optimize the program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary header files: The program includes several unnecessary header files that are not used. We can remove them to reduce the compile time and memory usage.

2. Remove unused typedefs: The program includes several typedefs that are not used. We can remove them to simplify the code and reduce memory usage.

3. Remove unnecessary macros: The program defines several macros that are not used. We can remove them to simplify the code.

4. Remove unused code: The program includes several functions and classes that are not used. We can remove them to simplify the code and reduce memory usage.

5. Remove unnecessary includes: The program includes several unnecessary header files that are not used. We can remove them to reduce the compile time and memory usage.

6. Simplify the code: The program includes several complex and unnecessary code constructs that can be simplified. We can simplify the code to improve readability and reduce memory usage.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <cmath>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

typedef double R;
typedef complex<R> P;

const R INF = 1e8;
const R EPS = 1e-6;

struct S {
  P p1, p2;
};

struct MSQ {
  int m, k;
  vector<P> p;
  vector<S> s;

  MSQ(int m, int k) : m(m), k(k) {
    for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
      R angle = 2 * M_PI * i / m + M_PI * 0.5;
      p.push_back(polar((R)1, angle));
    }
    for (int i = 0
