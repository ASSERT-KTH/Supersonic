The given program is already well-optimized in terms of code structure and algorithm efficiency. However, there are a few changes that can be made to further optimize the program:

1. Remove unnecessary header files: The program includes several header files that are not used. We can remove them to reduce the compilation time.

2. Remove unused typedefs: The program defines several typedefs that are not used. We can remove them to simplify the code.

3. Remove unused macros: The program defines several macros that are not used. We can remove them to simplify the code.

4. Replace unnecessary function calls: The program makes some unnecessary function calls that can be replaced with more efficient operations. For example, in the `less` function, we can replace `sig(x - y)` with `x < y` since `sig(x - y)` is equivalent to `x < y`.

5. Optimize the `convex_contains` function: The `convex_contains` function can be optimized by using a binary search algorithm to find the index of the point in the polygon. This will reduce the time complexity from O(n) to O(log n).

Here is the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <cassert>
#include <cmath>
#include <cstdio>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

typedef long long int ll;
typedef pair<int, int> pii;
typedef vector<int> vi;

struct S {
  double x, y;
  S(double x = 0, double y = 0) : x(x), y(y) {}
  S operator+(const S &s) const { return S(x + s.x, y + s.y); }
  S operator-(const S &s) const { return S(x - s.x, y - s.y); }
  S operator*(double k) const { return S(x * k, y * k); }
  S operator/(double k) const { return S(x / k
