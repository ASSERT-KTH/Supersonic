The given program is already quite optimized in terms of running time and memory usage. However, there are a few small modifications that can be made to further optimize the program.

1. Remove unnecessary header files: The program includes several header files that are not used. We can remove them to reduce the compilation time and memory usage.

2. Remove unnecessary typedefs and using statements: The program includes several typedefs and using statements that are not used. We can remove them to simplify the code and improve readability.

3. Remove unnecessary macros: The program includes several macros that are not used. We can remove them to simplify the code and improve readability.

4. Remove unnecessary functions and operators: The program includes several functions and operators that are not used. We can remove them to reduce the compilation time and memory usage.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <cmath>
#include <complex>
#include <cstdio>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <cstring>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

typedef complex<double> P;

struct S {
  P p1, p2;
  S(const P &p1, const P &p2) : p1(p1), p2(p2) {}
  S() {}
};

struct MSQ : public vector<P> {
  MSQ(int m, int k) {
    for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
      double angle = 2 * M_PI * i / m + M_PI / 2;
      push_back(polar(1.0, angle));
    }
    for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
      P p1 = at(i);
      P p2 = at((i + k) % m);
      push_back(p1);
      push_back(p2);
    }
    reverse(begin(), end());
  }
};
