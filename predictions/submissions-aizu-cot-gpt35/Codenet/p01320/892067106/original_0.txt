Step 1: Remove unnecessary includes and using namespace std

The program includes several unnecessary headers and also uses the "using namespace std" statement, which is generally considered bad practice. We can remove these to improve the compilation time and avoid potential naming conflicts.

Step 2: Remove unused typedefs and macros

The program defines several typedefs and macros that are not used in the code. We can safely remove these to simplify the code.

Step 3: Remove unused functions and operators

The program defines several overloaded operators and functions that are not used in the code. We can remove these to reduce the code size and improve readability.

Step 4: Optimize the check function

The check function is the most time-consuming part of the program. It checks if a given configuration of the MSQ object is valid. We can optimize this function by reducing unnecessary calculations and using early returns.

Step 5: Optimize the main function

The main function calls the check function multiple times in a loop. We can optimize this loop by keeping track of the best result found so far and using it to reduce the search space.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <cmath>
#include <cstdio>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

typedef long long int ll;
typedef pair<int, int> pii;
typedef vector<int> vi;

struct MSQ {
  vector<pii> seg;
  int m, k;

  MSQ(int m, int k) : m(m), k(k) {
    for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
      seg.emplace_back(i, (i + k) % m);
    }
  }

  bool check(R r, const vector<pii>& shoolack, int i, int j) {
    pii l = seg[j];
    pii gp = make_pair(shoolack[i].first - l.first * r,
                       shoolack[i].second - l.second *
