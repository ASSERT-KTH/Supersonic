Step 1: Remove unnecessary includes

The program includes the entire `<bits/stdc++.h>` library, which is not necessary and can slow down compilation time. We can remove this include statement and add the specific headers that are needed.

Step 2: Optimize input and output

The program currently uses `scanf` and `printf` for input and output. These functions can be slow compared to other input/output functions available in C++. We can optimize this by using `cin` and `cout` instead.

Step 3: Optimize the loop

The program currently uses a `while` loop with the condition `n--`. This can be optimized by using a `for` loop instead, which is generally faster.

Step 4: Remove unnecessary type definition

The program currently defines `P` as a type alias for `complex<double>`. This type alias is not necessary and can be removed.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <complex>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int n;
  double ax, ay, bx, by, cx, cy, dx, dy;
  cin >> n;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> ax >> ay >> bx >> by;
    cin >> cx >> cy >> dx >> dy;
    complex<double> k = complex<double>(bx - ax, by - ay) * complex<double>(dx - cx, cy - dy);
    if (k.imag() == 0)
      cout << "2\n";
    else if (k.real() == 0)
      cout << "1\n";
    else
      cout << "0\n";
  }
  return 0;
}
```
