The given C/C++ program reads some inputs and performs a series of calculations based on the inputs. It uses the `complex` library to perform complex number calculations.

To optimize the program for running time and memory usage, we can make several improvements:

1. Remove the unnecessary `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`. This header includes a lot of unnecessary libraries, which can slow down the compilation process. We only need `complex` and `iostream` libraries, so we can include only those.

2. Instead of using `scanf` and `printf` for input/output, we can use `cin` and `cout` respectively. This will simplify the code and potentially improve performance.

3. Since we are only interested in the real and imaginary parts of `k`, we can calculate them directly instead of using the `real()` and `imag()` functions.

4. Instead of using `complex<double>` for `P`, we can use a struct to represent a point. This will reduce memory usage and potentially improve performance.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

struct Point {
  double x, y;
};

int main() {
  int n;
  double ax, ay, bx, by, cx, cy, dx, dy;
  cin >> n;
  while (n--) {
    cin >> ax >> ay >> bx >> by;
    cin >> cx >> cy >> dx >> dy;
    double k_real = (bx - ax) * (dx - cx) + (by - ay) * (dy - cy);
    double k_imag = (bx - ax) * (cy - dy) - (by - ay) * (cx - dx);
    if (k_imag == 0)
      cout << "2" << endl;
    else if (k_real == 0)
      cout << "1" << endl;
    else
      cout << "0" << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```
