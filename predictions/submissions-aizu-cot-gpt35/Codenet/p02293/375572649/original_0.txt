1. Remove unnecessary header file inclusion.
2. Use `std::cin` and `std::cout` instead of `scanf` and `printf` for better performance.
3. Remove the `typedef` for complex numbers since it is not necessary.
4. Use `double` instead of `complex<double>` for the calculations, as we are only interested in the real and imaginary parts separately.
5. Avoid unnecessary calculations by directly checking the real and imaginary parts of the result.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  int n;
  double ax, ay, bx, by, cx, cy, dx, dy;
  std::cin >> n;
  while (n--) {
    std::cin >> ax >> ay >> bx >> by;
    std::cin >> cx >> cy >> dx >> dy;
    double k = (bx - ax) * (cy - dy) - (by - ay) * (cx - dx);
    if (k == 0)
      std::cout << "2\n";
    else if (k > 0)
      std::cout << "1\n";
    else
      std::cout << "0\n";
  }
  return 0;
}
```
