Step 1: Remove unnecessary headers
- The `<bits/stdc++.h>` header includes a lot of unnecessary headers, which may increase the compilation time and memory usage. We can replace it with the necessary headers instead.

Step 2: Optimize input/output operations
- Instead of using `scanf()` and `printf()`, we can use `cin` and `cout` which are generally faster.

Step 3: Reduce the number of computations
- Currently, the program calculates the product of two complex numbers in each iteration of the loop. We can optimize this by calculating the product once and storing it in a variable, then using that variable to perform the necessary comparisons.

Step 4: Simplify the conditionals
- The current conditionals can be simplified by using a single `if` statement with multiple conditions.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <complex>
using namespace std;

typedef complex<double> P;

int main() {
  int n;
  double ax, ay, bx, by, cx, cy, dx, dy;

  cin >> n;

  while (n--) {
    cin >> ax >> ay >> bx >> by;
    cin >> cx >> cy >> dx >> dy;

    P k = P(bx - ax, by - ay) * P(dx - cx, cy - dy);

    if (k.imag() == 0)
      cout << "2\n";
    else if (k.real() == 0)
      cout << "1\n";
    else
      cout << "0\n";
  }

  return 0;
}
```
