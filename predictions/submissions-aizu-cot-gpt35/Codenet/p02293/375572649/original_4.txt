The original program reads input from the user and performs some calculations on it. It then prints the result to the console. 

To optimize this program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary header inclusion: The program includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header, which is not necessary and can be removed.

2. Remove unnecessary namespace declaration: The program uses the `std` namespace, but only in one place. We can remove the `using namespace std;` line and use the `std::` prefix where necessary.

3. Replace `scanf` with `cin`: The program currently uses `scanf` to read input from the user. We can replace it with the `cin` stream for improved readability and type safety.

4. Replace `printf` with `cout`: Similarly, we can replace the `printf` function with the `cout` stream for improved readability and type safety.

5. Use `std::complex` instead of `typedef`: The program uses `typedef complex<double> P;` to define a complex number type. We can directly use `std::complex<double>` instead of `P` for improved clarity.

6. Use `std::abs` instead of comparing with zero: The program uses `k.imag() == 0` and `k.real() == 0` to check if the imaginary or real part of `k` is zero. We can use `std::abs` function from the `<cmath>` header to check if a value is close to zero instead.

The optimized program is as follows:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <complex>

int main() {
  int n;
  double ax, ay, bx, by, cx, cy, dx, dy;
  std::cin >> n;
  while (n--) {
    std::cin >> ax >> ay >> bx >> by;
    std::cin >> cx >> cy >> dx >> dy;
    std::complex<double> k = (std::complex<double>(bx - ax, by - ay) * std::complex<double>(dx - cx, cy - dy));
    if (std::abs(k.imag()) < 1e-9)
      std::cout << "2\n";
    else if (std::abs(k.real()) < 1e-9)
      std::cout << "1\n";
    else
      std::cout << "0\n";
  }
  return 0;
}
```
