Step 1: Remove unnecessary headers

The `<bits/stdc++.h>` header includes a large number of standard library headers, which can significantly increase compilation time. Since we are not using all of these headers, we can remove it and include only the necessary headers.

Step 2: Optimize complex number multiplication

In the program, the multiplication of two complex numbers `P(bx - ax, by - ay) * P(dx - cx, cy - dy)` can be optimized. Instead of creating two complex numbers and then multiplying them, we can directly calculate the result using the formula `(bx - ax) * (dx - cx) - (by - ay) * (dy - cy)`.

Step 3: Optimize input/output operations

The program is using `scanf` and `printf` for input and output operations, which can be slow compared to other input/output methods. We can use `cin` and `cout` instead, which are generally faster.

Based on the above optimizations, here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int n;
  double ax, ay, bx, by, cx, cy, dx, dy;
  cin >> n;
  while (n--) {
    cin >> ax >> ay >> bx >> by;
    cin >> cx >> cy >> dx >> dy;
    double k = (bx - ax) * (dx - cx) - (by - ay) * (dy - cy);
    if (k == 0.0)
      cout << "2\n";
    else if (k == 0.0)
      cout << "1\n";
    else
      cout << "0\n";
  }
  return 0;
}
```
