The given program is a dynamic programming solution for the 0/1 Knapsack problem, where we have to maximize the value of items that can be included in a knapsack of capacity W. The program uses a 2D array `dp` to store the optimal values for different subproblems.

Here are the optimization steps for the given program:

1. Remove the unnecessary inclusion of the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header file. This header includes all the standard library headers, which is not needed in this program.

2. Replace the use of variable-length arrays `value[N]` and `weight[N]` with `std::vector`s. Variable-length arrays are not standard in C++, and using `std::vector` will provide better memory management and flexibility.

3. Modify the outer loop condition in the second nested loop from `w <= W` to `w < W`. This is because the weights are zero-indexed and range from 0 to W-1.

4. Change the array size of `dp` to `[N+1][W+1]` instead of `[110][10010]`. This will ensure that we have enough space for storing the optimal values.

5. Initialize the first row of `dp` to all zeros outside the second nested loop. This will handle the case when the knapsack capacity is zero for any item.

6. Modify the inner loop condition to start from `weight[i]` instead of 0. This is because there is no need to check for weights less than `weight[i]` as they are not possible for including the current item.

7. Modify the second nested loop condition to start from `w = weight[i]` instead of `w = 0`. This will ensure that we only consider the subproblems where the current item can be included.

8. Instead of using `std::endl` for output, use `"\n"`. `std::endl` flushes the stream, which can be an unnecessary overhead.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  int N, W;
  cin >> N >> W;
  vector<int> value(N), weight(N);
  for (int i = 0; i < N; i++)
    cin >> value[i] >> weight[i];
  vector<vector<int>> dp(N + 1, vector<int>(W + 1, 0));
  for (int i = 0; i <= N; i++)
    dp[i][0] = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
    for (int w = weight[i]; w <= W; w++) {
      dp[i + 1][w] = max(dp[i][w - weight[i]] + value[i], dp[i][w]);
    }
  }
  cout << dp[N][W] << "\n";
  return 0;
}
```

These optimizations will improve the performance and memory usage of the program.
