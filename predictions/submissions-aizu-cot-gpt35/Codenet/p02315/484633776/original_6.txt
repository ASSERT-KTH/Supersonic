The given program is a dynamic programming solution to the 0/1 Knapsack problem. The goal is to optimize the program for running time and memory usage.

Step 1: Remove unnecessary header file
The `<bits/stdc++.h>` header file includes a large number of standard C++ libraries, which can slow down the compilation process. Since the program only requires the `iostream` library, we can remove the unnecessary header file.

Step 2: Use vector instead of array
Instead of using arrays for `value` and `weight`, we can use `vector` containers. Vectors provide dynamic resizing, which can save memory if the input `N` is larger than the initial array size.

Step 3: Optimize loop conditions
In the second loop, the condition `w <= W` can be changed to `w < W` since the weight index starts from 0.

Step 4: Optimize loop initialization
The first loop initializes `dp[0][i] = 0` for all `i` up to `W`. However, since the weight index starts from 0, we can initialize `dp[0][0] = 0` and skip the initialization loop.

Step 5: Use a single-dimensional array instead of a 2D array
Since the value of `dp[i][w]` only depends on the previous row `dp[i-1][w]` and `dp[i-1][w-weight[i]]`, we can use a single-dimensional array to store the values. This optimization reduces the memory usage.

Step 6: Return optimized program

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int N, W;
  cin >> N >> W;
  vector<int> value(N), weight(N);
  for (int i = 0; i < N; i++)
    cin >> value[i] >> weight[i];
  vector<int> dp(W + 1, 0);
  for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
    for (int w = W; w >= weight[i]; w--) {
      dp[w] = max(dp[w - weight[i]] + value[i], dp[w]);
    }
  }
  cout << dp[W] << endl;
  return 0;
}
```
