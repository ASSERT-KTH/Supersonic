The given program is a dynamic programming solution to the 0/1 Knapsack problem. The goal is to maximize the total value of items that can be included in the knapsack without exceeding its weight capacity.

To optimize the program for running time and memory usage, we can make the following changes:

1. Instead of using a fixed-size array for `dp`, we can use a dynamic 2D array. This will allow us to allocate memory only for the required size, reducing memory usage.

2. We can remove the `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` line as it is unnecessary and can slow down the compilation process.

3. We can change the loop condition in the inner loop from `w <= W` to `w < W`. This is because the weight array has a size of `N`, so the maximum valid index is `N-1`, not `N`.

Here is the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int N, W;
  cin >> N >> W;
  int value[N], weight[N];
  for (int i = 0; i < N; i++)
    cin >> value[i] >> weight[i];

  int** dp = new int*[N+1];
  for (int i = 0; i <= N; i++)
    dp[i] = new int[W+1];

  for (int i = 0; i <= N; i++)
    dp[i][0] = 0;

  for (int i = 0; i <= W; i++)
    dp[0][i] = 0;

  for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
    for (int w = 1; w < W; w++) {
      if (w >= weight[i])
        dp[i + 1][w] = max(dp[i][w - weight[i]] + value[i], dp[i][w]);
      else
        dp[i + 1][w] = dp[i][w];
    }
  }

  cout << dp[N][W] << endl;

  for (int i = 0; i <= N; i++)
    delete[] dp[i];
  delete[] dp;

  return 0;
}
```

Explanation of the optimizations:

1. The dynamic allocation of memory for `dp` allows us to allocate memory only for the required size, reducing memory usage. We allocate `N+1` rows and `W+1` columns as the indices start from 0.

2. Removing the unnecessary include statement avoids including unnecessary header files and potentially speeds up the compilation process.

3. Changing the loop condition in the inner loop from `w <= W` to `w < W` ensures that we only iterate up to `W-1`, which is the maximum valid index for the weight array. This prevents accessing out-of-bounds memory and improves runtime efficiency.
