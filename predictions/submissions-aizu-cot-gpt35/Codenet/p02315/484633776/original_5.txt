The given program solves the 0/1 Knapsack problem using dynamic programming. The optimization can be done by reducing the space complexity of the program.

Currently, the program uses a 2D array `dp[N+1][W+1]` to store the maximum value for each subproblem. However, we can observe that at any point during the computation, we only need the values from the current row and the previous row to update the values in the next row. Therefore, we can reduce the space complexity by using a 1D array of size `W+1` instead of a 2D array.

Here are the optimization steps:

1. Remove the line `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`. This includes all the standard libraries, which is unnecessary.

2. Change the data type of `N` and `W` to `int64_t` to handle large inputs.

3. Replace the `int dp[110][10010]` with a 1D array `int64_t dp[W+1]`.

4. Update the loop `for (int i = 0; i < N; i++)` to `for (int64_t i = 0; i < N; i++)`.

5. Inside the inner loop, update the assignment of `dp[i + 1][w]` to `dp[w]`.

6. Update the loop `for (int w = 0; w <= W; w++)` to `for (int64_t w = 0; w <= W; w++)`.

7. Replace the line `cout << dp[N][W] << endl;` with `cout << dp[W] << endl;`.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int64_t N, W;
  cin >> N >> W;
  int64_t value[N], weight[N];
  for (int64_t i = 0; i < N; i++)
    cin >> value[i] >> weight[i];
  int64_t dp[W+1];
  for (int64_t i = 0; i <= W; i++)
    dp[i] = 0;
  for (int64_t i = 0; i < N; i++) {
    for (int64_t w = W; w >= weight[i]; w--) {
      dp[w] = max(dp[w - weight[i]] + value[i], dp[w]);
    }
  }
  cout << dp[W] << endl;
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized program reduces the space complexity from O(N*W) to O(W), resulting in improved memory usage. It also performs the same computation as the original program, but with faster running time due to the reduced memory access.
