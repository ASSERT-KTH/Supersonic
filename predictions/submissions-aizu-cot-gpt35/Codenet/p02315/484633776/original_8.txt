Step 1: Remove unnecessary includes
The program includes the entire `<bits/stdc++.h>` library, which is not necessary and can slow down the compilation process. We can remove it and only include the necessary headers.

Step 2: Use `vector` instead of arrays
The program uses arrays to store the values and weights. We can use `vector` instead, which provides dynamic resizing and can be more memory-efficient.

Step 3: Optimize loop conditions
The loop conditions in the program can be optimized to improve performance. For example, the loop condition in the second `for` loop can be changed from `w <= W` to `w < W` since `W` is not included in the loop.

Step 4: Optimize loop initialization
The loop initialization in the second `for` loop can be optimized by starting from `1` instead of `0`, since the first row of `dp` is already initialized to `0`.

Step 5: Use `reserve` for `vector` capacity
Before reading the values and weights, we can use the `reserve` function to allocate memory for the `value` and `weight` vectors. This can improve memory usage by avoiding frequent reallocations.

Step 6: Use `emplace_back` instead of `push_back`
When reading the values and weights, we can use `emplace_back` instead of `push_back` to construct the elements directly in the vector, avoiding unnecessary copies.

Step 7: Use a smaller array size
The size of the `dp` array can be reduced to `N+1` rows and `W+1` columns, since the last row and column are the only ones used in the calculation.

Here is the optimized C++ program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int N, W;
  cin >> N >> W;

  vector<int> value, weight;
  value.reserve(N);
  weight.reserve(N);

  for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
    int v, w;
    cin >> v >> w;
    value.emplace_back(v);
    weight.emplace_back(w);
  }

  vector<vector<int>> dp(N + 1, vector<int>(W + 1, 0));

  for (int i = 1; i <= N; i++) {
    for (int w = 1; w <= W; w++) {
      if (w >= weight[i - 1])
        dp[i][w] = max(dp[i - 1][w - weight[i - 1]] + value[i - 1], dp[i - 1][w]);
      else
        dp[i][w] = dp[i - 1][w];
    }
  }

  cout << dp[N][W] << endl;
  return 0;
}
```
