The given program is solving the 0/1 Knapsack problem using dynamic programming. The optimization steps that can be taken are as follows:

1. Remove unnecessary headers: The program includes `<bits/stdc++.h>` which is a non-standard header and includes multiple other headers. Since the program does not use any specific features from these headers, we can remove this line.

2. Use `vector` instead of fixed-size arrays: Instead of using fixed-size arrays for `value` and `weight`, we can use a `vector` container. This will allow us to dynamically allocate memory based on the input size.

3. Reduce the size of `dp` array: The `dp` array is currently defined as `int dp[110][10010]`. We can optimize this by reducing the size of the array to `int dp[N + 1][W + 1]`. This will save memory and also make the code more readable.

4. Change the loop condition: The loop condition `for (int i = 0; i < W; i++)` should be changed to `for (int i = 0; i <= W; i++)` to include the maximum weight `W`.

5. Optimize the inner loop condition: The inner loop condition `for (int w = 0; w <= W; w++)` should be changed to `for (int w = weight[i]; w <= W; w++)`. This will avoid unnecessary calculations when the weight of the current item is greater than the current weight `w`.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int N, W;
  cin >> N >> W;

  vector<int> value(N);
  vector<int> weight(N);

  for (int i = 0; i < N; i++)
    cin >> value[i] >> weight[i];

  vector<vector<int>> dp(N + 1, vector<int>(W + 1, 0));

  for (int i = 0; i <= W; i++)
    dp[0][i] = 0;

  for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
    for (int w = weight[i]; w <= W; w++) {
      dp[i + 1][w] = max(dp[i][w - weight[i]] + value[i], dp[i][w]);
    }
  }

  cout << dp[N][W] << endl;

  return 0;
}
```

This optimized program reduces the memory usage by using vectors instead of fixed-size arrays and also improves the running time by avoiding unnecessary calculations.
