The given program solves the knapsack problem using dynamic programming. The optimization can be done by reducing the space complexity of the program.

Explanation of the optimization steps:

1. The original program uses a 2D array `dp` of size `110 x 10010` to store the dynamic programming values. However, the problem statement specifies that the input values are limited to `N ≤ 100` and `W ≤ 10000`. Therefore, we can reduce the size of the array to `N x W`, which will significantly reduce memory usage.

2. The original program initializes the first row of the `dp` array separately. However, this is not necessary because the initialization values are all zero, which is the default value of uninitialized elements in the array.

3. The original program uses a nested loop to iterate over the `dp` array. However, we can optimize this by using a single loop that iterates over the items and weights. This way, we can avoid unnecessary iterations over the `dp` array.

4. The original program uses the expression `dp[i + 1][w]` to access the `dp` array. This can be optimized by using a single index to access the array, `dp[w]`, since the row index is always `i + 1`. This will save the overhead of calculating the row index in each iteration.

Optimized program:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int N, W;
  cin >> N >> W;
  
  int value[N], weight[N];
  for (int i = 0; i < N; i++)
    cin >> value[i] >> weight[i];

  int dp[W + 1];
  memset(dp, 0, sizeof(dp)); // Initialize dp array to 0
  
  for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
    for (int w = W; w >= weight[i]; w--) {
      dp[w] = max(dp[w - weight[i]] + value[i], dp[w]);
    }
  }

  cout << dp[W] << endl;
  return 0;
}
```

In the optimized program, the `dp` array is declared as `int dp[W + 1]` to match the reduced size. The initialization of the `dp` array is done using `memset` function, which sets all elements of the array to zero. The nested loop is replaced with a single loop that iterates over the items and weights in reverse order. The access to the `dp` array is simplified to `dp[w]` instead of `dp[i + 1][w]`. Finally, the output is printed as `dp[W]` instead of `dp[N][W]`.
