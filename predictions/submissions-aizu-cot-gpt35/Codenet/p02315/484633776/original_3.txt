Step 1: Avoid using `bits/stdc++.h` header
The `bits/stdc++.h` header is not a standard C++ header and including it may increase the compilation time. Instead, include only the necessary standard headers. In this case, `iostream` is the only required header.

Step 2: Avoid using variable length arrays
The original program uses variable length arrays, which are not standard C++. Instead, use `std::vector` to dynamically allocate memory for the arrays.

Step 3: Optimize the loop limits
The loops that iterate over the arrays `dp` and `weight` have incorrect limits. The outer loop should iterate up to `N`, not `W`, and the inner loop should iterate up to `W + 1`, not `W`. This will ensure that the entire array is filled correctly.

Step 4: Optimize the loop conditions
The condition `w <= W` in the inner loop can be changed to `w < W` since the loop is supposed to iterate up to `W`. This will avoid unnecessary iterations.

Step 5: Optimize the loop initialization
The loop that initializes `dp` can be optimized by initializing only the necessary elements. Instead of initializing all elements up to `W`, we can initialize only the elements up to `W + 1`.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int N, W;
  cin >> N >> W;
  
  vector<int> value(N), weight(N);
  for (int i = 0; i < N; i++)
    cin >> value[i] >> weight[i];

  vector<vector<int>> dp(N + 1, vector<int>(W + 1, 0));
  
  for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
    for (int w = 0; w < W + 1; w++) {
      if (w >= weight[i])
        dp[i + 1][w] = max(dp[i][w - weight[i]] + value[i], dp[i][w]);
      else
        dp[i + 1][w] = dp[i][w];
    }
  }
  
  cout << dp[N][W] << endl;
  return 0;
}
```
