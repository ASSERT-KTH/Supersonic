The given program is an implementation of the 0/1 Knapsack problem using dynamic programming. The goal is to maximize the value of items that can be selected, given a weight constraint.

To optimize the program, we can make a small modification in the inner loop. Currently, the inner loop iterates from 0 to W, but we can optimize it by iterating from w[i] to W. This is because if the weight of the current item is greater than the current weight limit j, then we can't select that item anyway, so there is no need to consider it.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int dp[1001][10001];

int main() {
  int N, W;
  cin >> N >> W;
  vector<int> v(N), w(N);
  for (int i = 0; i < N; i++)
    cin >> v[i] >> w[i];

  for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
    for (int j = w[i]; j <= W; j++) {  // Optimized loop
      dp[i + 1][j] = max(dp[i][j], dp[i][j - w[i]] + v[i]);
    }
  }

  cout << dp[N][W] << endl;
  return 0;
}
```

Explanation:
- We modified the inner loop from `for (int j = 0; j <= W; j++)` to `for (int j = w[i]; j <= W; j++)`.
- This optimization eliminates unnecessary iterations of the loop when the weight of the current item is greater than the current weight limit j.
- By starting the loop from w[i], we ensure that we only consider valid weights for selecting items, which improves the running time of the program.
