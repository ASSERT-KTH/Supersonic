Step 1: Use a 2D array dynamically

The current program is using a static 2D array `dp[1001][10001]` to store the dynamic programming table. This can lead to excessive memory usage if `N` and `W` are small. To optimize memory usage, we can allocate the 2D array dynamically based on the input values of `N` and `W` using `new` operator. This will reduce memory wastage and allow the program to handle larger input sizes.

Step 2: Use variables instead of vector indexing

The program is currently using vectors `v` and `w` to store the values and weights. However, accessing elements using vector indexing can be slower compared to using variables directly. We can assign the values and weights to variables before the nested loop starts, and then use these variables inside the loop to improve performance.

Step 3: Optimize the inner loop condition

The inner loop condition `j <= W` is currently being checked for every iteration of the loop. We can optimize this by moving the check outside the loop and assigning the value to a variable. This will reduce the number of comparisons and improve performance.

Step 4: Use a variable for `dp[i][j]`

The program is currently accessing `dp[i][j]` multiple times in the inner loop. We can assign this value to a variable before the inner loop starts and use that variable inside the loop. This will reduce the array accesses and improve performance.

Step 5: Initialize the dynamic programming table

The dynamic programming table `dp` is not being initialized before the nested loop starts. This can lead to incorrect results if the initial values are not zero. We need to initialize the table with zeros before starting the nested loop.

Here is the optimized code:

```
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int N, W;
  cin >> N >> W;

  vector<int> v(N), w(N);
  for (int i = 0; i < N; i++)
    cin >> v[i] >> w[i];

  int** dp = new int*[N + 1];
  for (int i = 0; i <= N; i++)
    dp[i] = new int[W + 1];

  for (int i = 0; i <= N; i++)
    for (int j = 0; j <= W; j++)
      dp[i][j] = 0;

  for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
    int vi = v[i];
    int wi = w[i];
    for (int j = 0; j <= W; j++) {
      int dp_ij = dp[i][j];
      if (j - wi < 0) {
        dp[i + 1][j] = dp_ij;
      } else {
        dp[i + 1][j] = max(dp_ij, dp[i][j - wi] + vi);
      }
    }
  }
  
  cout << dp[N][W] << endl;

  for (int i = 0; i <= N; i++)
    delete[] dp[i];
  delete[] dp;

  return 0;
}
```
