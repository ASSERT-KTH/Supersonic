The given C++ program solves the 0-1 Knapsack problem using dynamic programming. The optimization can be done by reducing the size of the dp array.

In the original program, the dp array is declared as `int dp[1001][10001]`. This means that the maximum possible values for N and W are 1000 and 10000 respectively. However, in the loop where the dp array is filled, the indices used are `dp[i + 1][j]` and `dp[i][j]`. This implies that the size of the dp array can be reduced to `int dp[2][10001]`, where the first dimension represents `i` and the second dimension represents `j`.

By reducing the size of the dp array, the memory usage will be significantly reduced. Additionally, the loop where the dp array is filled can be modified to only use two rows of the dp array at a time, instead of the entire array. This will further reduce the memory usage and also improve cache efficiency.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int N, W;
  cin >> N >> W;
  vector<int> v(N), w(N);
  for (int i = 0; i < N; i++)
    cin >> v[i] >> w[i];
  
  int dp[2][10001] = {0};
  for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j <= W; j++) {
      if (j - w[i] < 0) {
        dp[(i + 1) % 2][j] = dp[i % 2][j];
      } else {
        dp[(i + 1) % 2][j] = max(dp[i % 2][j], dp[i % 2][j - w[i]] + v[i]);
      }
    }
  }
  cout << dp[N % 2][W] << endl;
  return 0;
}
```

In the optimized program, the dp array is declared as `int dp[2][10001]`. The `(i + 1) % 2` and `i % 2` expressions are used to alternate between the two rows of the dp array. This way, only two rows of the dp array are used at a time instead of the entire array.

The rest of the program remains the same.
