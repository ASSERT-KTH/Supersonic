Step 1: Remove unnecessary includes and macros

The program includes a header file `<bits/stdc++.h>` which is not necessary and can be replaced with specific header files that are actually needed. Similarly, some macros are defined but not used in the program.

Step 2: Remove unnecessary typedefs and aliases

The program defines some typedefs and aliases like `vvi`, `vec`, and `pq` which are not used in the program. We can remove them to simplify the code.

Step 3: Remove unnecessary debug statements

The program includes some debug statements that are used for debugging purposes but are not needed in the final optimized program. We can remove them to improve the running time and reduce memory usage.

Step 4: Fix a bug in initializing the dp array

There is a bug in the initialization of the `dp` array. The line `rep(i, W + 1) dp[0][W] = 0;` should be `rep(i, W + 1) dp[0][i] = 0;` to correctly initialize the array.

Step 5: Optimize the nested loops

The nested loops can be optimized to improve the running time. Instead of iterating from 0 to `W`, we can iterate from `weight[i]` to `W` in the inner loop. This way, we can avoid unnecessary iterations for smaller weights that are not possible to achieve.

Step 6: Remove unused variables

The variables `dx`, `dy`, and `PI` are defined but not used in the program. We can remove them to simplify the code.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int n, W;
  cin >> n >> W;

  vector<int> weight(n), value(n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> value[i] >> weight[i];
  }

  vector<vector<int>> dp(n + 1, vector<int>(W + 1, 0));
  
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    for (int w = weight[i]; w <= W; w++) {
      dp[i + 1][w] = max(dp[i][w - weight[i]] + value[i], dp[i][w]);
    }
  }
  
  cout << dp[n][W] << endl;

  return 0;
}
```

Explanation:

1. Removed unnecessary includes like `<bits/stdc++.h>`.
2. Removed unused typedefs and aliases like `vvi`, `vec`, and `pq`.
3. Removed unnecessary debug statements.
4. Fixed the bug in initializing the `dp` array.
5. Optimized the nested loops to iterate from `weight[i]` to `W`.
6. Removed unused variables like `dx`, `dy`, and `PI`.
