The given program solves the knapsack problem using dynamic programming. The optimization can be done by removing unnecessary macros and function calls, and by using a 2D array instead of a vector.

Here are the steps to optimize the program:

1. Remove unnecessary macros: The macros `ll`, `vvi`, `vec`, `pq`, `all(v)`, `uniqueV(x)`, `rep(i, n)`, `repp(i, m, n)`, `debug(x)`, `debug2(x, y)`, `debug3(x, y, z)`, `debugB(value, size)`, `line()`, `const int dx[]`, `const int dy[]`, and `const double PI` can be removed as they are not used in the program.

2. Replace `vector` with an array: The `weight` and `value` arrays can be replaced with vectors. This will reduce memory usage and improve performance.

3. Remove unnecessary function calls: The `printA` function is not used in the program and can be removed.

4. Use a 2D array instead of a vector: The `dp` vector can be replaced with a 2D array. This will reduce memory usage and improve performance.

5. Remove unnecessary loop initialization: The loop `rep(i, W + 1) dp[0][W] = 0;` initializes the entire row of the `dp` array with 0. However, only `dp[0][W]` needs to be initialized. This loop can be removed.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

const int MAX_N = 110;
const int MAX_W = 10010;
int n, W;
int weight[MAX_N], value[MAX_N];
int dp[MAX_N][MAX_W];

int main() {
  cin >> n >> W;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> value[i] >> weight[i];
  }
  for (int i = 0; i <= n; i++) {
    for (int w = 0; w <= W; w++) {
      if (w >= weight[i]) {
        dp[i + 1][w] = max(dp[i][w - weight[i]] + value[i], dp[i][w]);
      } else {
        dp[i + 1][w] = dp[i][w];
      }
    }
  }
  cout << dp[n][W] << endl;
  return 0;
}
```

By removing unnecessary macros, function calls, and using a 2D array, the optimized program will have improved running time and reduced memory usage.
