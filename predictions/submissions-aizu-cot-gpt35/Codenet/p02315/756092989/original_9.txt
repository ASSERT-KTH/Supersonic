Step 1: Remove unnecessary includes and macros.

The `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` is a non-standard header and is not necessary for this program. It includes a lot of unnecessary headers that can slow down the compilation process.

The macros `ll`, `vvi`, `vec`, and `pq` are not used in the program and can be removed.

Step 2: Remove unnecessary functions and templates.

The `debug`, `debug2`, `debug3`, `debugB`, and `line` functions are not used in the program and can be removed.

The `printA` template is not used in the program and can be removed.

Step 3: Optimize the uniqueV macro.

The `uniqueV` macro uses the `sort` and `erase` functions to remove duplicates from a vector. However, it is not used in the program and can be removed.

Step 4: Optimize the main function.

The `dp` array is initialized incorrectly. The line `rep(i, W + 1) dp[0][W] = 0;` should be `rep(i, W + 1) dp[0][i] = 0;` to initialize all elements of the first row to 0.

Step 5: Optimize the nested loops.

The nested loops can be optimized by reversing the order of the loops. Instead of iterating over the weights and then the items, we can iterate over the items and then the weights. This allows us to access the `dp` array more efficiently.

Step 6: Remove unnecessary variables.

The variables `dx`, `dy`, and `PI` are not used in the program and can be removed.

Step 7: Optimize input and output operations.

The program uses `cin` and `cout` to read and write integers. However, these operations can be slow for large inputs and outputs. We can use `scanf` and `printf` functions for faster input and output.

Here is the optimized program:

```
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

const int MAX_N = 110;
const int MAX_W = 10010;

int n, W;
int weight[MAX_N], value[MAX_N];
int dp[MAX_N][MAX_W];

int main() {
  scanf("%d %d", &n, &W);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    scanf("%d %d", &value[i], &weight[i]);
  }
  
  for (int i = 0; i <= W; i++) {
    dp[0][i] = 0;
  }

  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    for (int w = 0; w <= W; w++) {
      if (w >= weight[i]) {
        dp[i + 1][w] = max(dp[i][w - weight[i]] + value[i], dp[i][w]);
      } else {
        dp[i + 1][w] = dp[i][w];
      }
    }
  }
  
  printf("%d\n", dp[n][W]);
  return 0;
}
```
