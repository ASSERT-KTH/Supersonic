Step 1: Eliminate unnecessary includes
- The line `#include<bits/stdc++.h>` includes almost all the standard library headers. This can lead to slower compilation times and unnecessary memory usage. We should only include the headers that are actually needed.

Step 2: Remove unnecessary macros
- The macros defined in the code are not used anywhere in the program. We should remove them to simplify the code.

Step 3: Remove unnecessary debug statements
- The debug statements are not used in the final version of the program. We should remove them to improve the program's running time and reduce memory usage.

Step 4: Remove unnecessary template function
- The `printA` template function is not used in the final version of the program. We should remove it to simplify the code.

Step 5: Optimize the nested loop
- The nested loop can be optimized by changing the loop condition. Instead of iterating through all possible weights, we can iterate from `weight[i]` to `W`. This reduces the number of unnecessary iterations and improves the running time of the program.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int n, W;
  cin >> n >> W;

  vector<int> weight(n), value(n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> value[i] >> weight[i];
  }

  vector<vector<int>> dp(n + 1, vector<int>(W + 1, 0));
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    for (int w = weight[i]; w <= W; w++) {
      dp[i + 1][w] = max(dp[i][w - weight[i]] + value[i], dp[i][w]);
    }
  }

  cout << dp[n][W] << endl;
  return 0;
}
```
