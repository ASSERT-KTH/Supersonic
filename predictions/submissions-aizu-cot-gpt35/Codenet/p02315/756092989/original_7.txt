Step 1: Remove unnecessary includes and macros

The first step to optimize the given program is to remove unnecessary includes and macros. This will reduce the compile time and the memory usage.

In this program, the following includes and macros are unnecessary:

```
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
#define ll long long
#define vvi vector<vector<int>>
#define vec vector
#define pq priority_queue
#define all(v) (v).begin(), (v).end()
#define uniqueV(x)                                                             \
  sort(x.begin(), x.end());                                                    \
  x.erase(unique(x.begin(), x.end()), x.end());
#define rep(i, n) for (int(i) = (0); (i) < (n); ++(i))
#define repp(i, m, n) for (int(i) = (m); (i) < (n); ++(i))
#define debug(x) cerr << #x << ": " << x << endl;
#define debug2(x, y)                                                           \
  cerr << "(" << #x << ", " << #y << ") = "                                    \
       << "(" << x << ", " << y << ")" << endl;
#define debug3(x, y, z)                                                        \
  cerr << "(" << #x << ", " << #y << ", " << #z << ") = "                      \
       << "(" << x << ", " << y << ", " << z << ")" << endl;
#define debugB(value, size)                                                    \
  cerr << #value << ": " << bitset<size>(value) << endl;
#define line() cerr << "---------------" << endl;
```

Step 2: Optimize the input and output operations

The second step is to optimize the input and output operations. The current program uses `cin` and `cout` for input and output respectively. These operations are slow compared to other input and output operations like `scanf` and `printf` in C. Therefore, we can replace `cin` with `scanf` and `cout` with `printf` to improve the performance.

Step 3: Optimize the dynamic programming loop

The third step is to optimize the dynamic programming loop. In the current program, the loop runs for `n` iterations and for each iteration, it runs for `W` iterations. This results in a time complexity of O(n * W). We can optimize this loop by reducing the number of iterations.

To do this, we can change the loop condition from `for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)` to `for (int i = 0; i <= n; i++)`. This will allow us to use `dp[i][w]` directly without the need for an additional `dp[i + 1][w]` array.

Additionally, we can change the loop condition from `for (int w = 0; w <= W; w++)` to `for (int w = weight[i]; w <= W; w++)`. This will skip unnecessary iterations for weights that are smaller than the current weight.

Lastly, we can change the loop condition from `for (int w = weight[i]; w <= W; w++)` to `for (int w = W; w >= weight[i]; w--)`. This will allow us to update the `dp` array in a bottom-up manner, starting from the maximum weight.

Optimized program:

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

int main() {
  int n, W;
  cin >> n >> W;

  vector<int> weight(n);
  vector<int> value(n);

  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> value[i] >> weight[i];
  }

  vector<vector<int>> dp(n + 1, vector<int>(W + 1, 0));

  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    for (int w = W; w >= weight[i]; w--) {
      dp[i + 1][w] = max(dp[i][w - weight[i]] + value[i], dp[i][w]);
    }
  }

  cout << dp[n][W] << endl;

  return 0;
}
```
