Step 1: Removing unnecessary includes and using namespace std

The program includes the entire `<bits/stdc++.h>` header, which is not recommended as it includes a lot of unnecessary headers. We can remove it and include only the necessary headers.

The `using namespace std;` statement is generally discouraged as it pollutes the global namespace. We can remove it and use the `std::` prefix for standard library functions and types.

Step 2: Removing unnecessary macros

The program defines several macros that are not used. We can remove them to simplify the code.

Step 3: Removing unnecessary debug code

The program includes several debug macros that are not used. We can remove them to improve the readability of the code.

Step 4: Simplifying the printA function

The `printA` function is not used in the program. We can remove it.

Step 5: Optimizing the dp loop

The inner loop of the dp calculation can be optimized by starting from `weight[i]` instead of 0. This way, we can avoid unnecessary calculations when `w < weight[i]`.

Step 6: Optimized code

Here is the optimized code after applying the above steps:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

int main() {
  int n, W;
  std::cin >> n >> W;

  std::vector<int> weight(n), value(n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    std::cin >> value[i] >> weight[i];
  }

  std::vector<std::vector<int>> dp(n + 1, std::vector<int>(W + 1, 0));

  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    for (int w = weight[i]; w <= W; w++) {
      dp[i + 1][w] = std::max(dp[i][w - weight[i]] + value[i], dp[i][w]);
    }
  }

  std::cout << dp[n][W] << std::endl;

  return 0;
}
```
