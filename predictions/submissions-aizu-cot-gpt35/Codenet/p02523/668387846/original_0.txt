The given program calculates the absolute difference between two complex numbers entered by the user. To optimize this program for running time and memory usage, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary header files: The `<cmath>`, `<cstdio>`, and `<iostream>` header files are not needed in this program since we are not using any functions or features from these headers.

2. Remove the `using namespace std;` statement: This statement introduces all the names from the `std` namespace into the global namespace. It is considered a good practice to avoid this statement to prevent potential naming conflicts.

3. Replace `cin` and `printf` with `scanf` and `printf`: The `cin` and `cout` streams are generally slower than the `scanf` and `printf` functions for input and output operations. By using `scanf` and `printf`, we can potentially improve the running time of the program.

4. Avoid unnecessary complex number calculations: The original program unnecessarily constructs complex numbers `P1` and `P2` before calculating their absolute difference. We can directly read the real and imaginary parts of the numbers and calculate the absolute difference without constructing complex numbers.

Based on these optimizations, the optimized program will have the following modifications:

```cpp
#include <complex>
#include <cstdio>

int main() {
  double P1_real, P1_imag, P2_real, P2_imag;
  scanf("%lf %lf %lf %lf", &P1_real, &P1_imag, &P2_real, &P2_imag);
  double abs_diff = sqrt(pow(P1_real - P2_real, 2) + pow(P1_imag - P2_imag, 2));
  printf("%.5f\n", abs_diff);
  return 0;
}
```
