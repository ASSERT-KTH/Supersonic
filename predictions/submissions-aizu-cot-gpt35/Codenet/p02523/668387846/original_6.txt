The given program reads two complex numbers from the user, calculates the absolute difference between them, and prints the result with 5 decimal places.

To optimize this program, we can make the following modifications:
1. Remove unnecessary header files: The `<cmath>` and `<complex>` header files are not needed because they are not used in the program. We can remove them.
2. Remove unnecessary namespace usage: The `using namespace std;` statement is not needed because we can use the `std::` prefix to access the required functions and classes.
3. Use `std::cin` and `std::cout` instead of `cin` and `cout` for input/output operations.
4. Avoid unnecessary complex number calculations: We can avoid creating complex numbers and directly calculate the absolute difference between the real and imaginary parts of the input numbers.

Here is the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  double re1, im1, re2, im2;
  std::cin >> re1 >> im1 >> re2 >> im2;
  
  double absDiff = std::sqrt((re1 - re2) * (re1 - re2) + (im1 - im2) * (im1 - im2));
  std::cout.precision(5);
  std::cout << std::fixed << absDiff << std::endl;
  
  return 0;
}
```
