The given program calculates the absolute difference between two complex numbers entered by the user. To optimize the program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary header files: The program includes `<cmath>`, `<complex>`, and `<cstdio>` header files. However, only `<complex>` is required for the complex number operations used in the program. Therefore, we can remove the unnecessary header files.

2. Remove the `using namespace std;` line: It is considered a good practice to avoid using the `using namespace std;` statement in global scope as it can lead to naming conflicts. Instead, we can use the `std::` prefix to specify the usage of std namespace explicitly.

3. Use `std::cin` and `std::cout` instead of `cin` and `cout`: By using `std::cin` and `std::cout` explicitly, we avoid potential naming conflicts and make the code more readable.

4. Remove unnecessary `return 0;`: In C++, the `return 0;` statement at the end of the `main` function is not required.

Here is the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <complex>
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  std::complex<double> P1, P2;
  std::cin >> P1.real() >> P1.imag() >> P2.real() >> P2.imag();
  std::cout << std::abs(P1 - P2) << std::endl;
}
```
