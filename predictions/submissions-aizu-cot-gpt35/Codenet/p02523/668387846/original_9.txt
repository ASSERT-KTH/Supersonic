Step 1: Remove unnecessary header files

The program includes the header files `<cmath>` and `<complex>`, but they are not used in the program. We can remove these unnecessary header files.

Step 2: Remove unnecessary `using` statement

The program includes the statement `using namespace std;`, but it is not necessary since the only thing used from the `std` namespace is `std::complex`. We can remove the `using` statement and replace `complex<double>` with `std::complex<double>`.

Step 3: Avoid using `printf` and `scanf`

The program uses `printf` and `scanf` for input and output. However, they are slower and less type-safe compared to C++ stream operations. We can replace `printf` with `std::cout` and `scanf` with `std::cin` for better performance and type safety.

Step 4: Use `std::setprecision` instead of `printf`

The program uses `printf` with the format specifier `%.5f` to display the result with 5 decimal places. We can achieve the same result using `std::cout` and `std::setprecision` from the `<iomanip>` header.

Step 5: Optimize the calculation of absolute value

The program uses `abs(P1 - P2)` to calculate the absolute value of the difference between two complex numbers. However, `abs` is designed for integers, not complex numbers. We can optimize this calculation by using `std::abs` from the `<cmath>` header, which is specifically designed for floating-point numbers.

Optimized program:

```cpp
#include <complex>
#include <iostream>
#include <iomanip>

int main() {
  std::complex<double> P1, P2;
  std::cin >> P1.real() >> P1.imag() >> P2.real() >> P2.imag();
  std::cout << std::setprecision(5) << std::abs(P1 - P2) << std::endl;
  return 0;
}
```
