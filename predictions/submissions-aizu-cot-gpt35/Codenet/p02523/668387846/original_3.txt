The given program calculates the distance between two points in a complex plane. 

The optimization step here is to remove the unnecessary include statements. We only need `<complex>` and `<iostream>` for this program, so we can remove `<cmath>` and `<cstdio>`.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <complex>
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  std::complex<double> P1, P2;
  std::cin >> P1.real() >> P1.imag() >> P2.real() >> P2.imag();
  std::cout << std::abs(P1 - P2) << std::endl;
  return 0;
}
```
