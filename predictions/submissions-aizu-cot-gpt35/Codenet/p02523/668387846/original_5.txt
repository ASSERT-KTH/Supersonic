The given program reads two complex numbers from the user and calculates the absolute difference between them. The program uses the `complex` library from C++ standard library to handle complex numbers.

To optimize the program, we can make the following modifications:
1. Remove unnecessary header files: The program includes unnecessary header files such as `<cmath>` and `<cstdio>`. Since we are not using any functions from these libraries, we can remove them.
2. Remove `using namespace std;`: The program uses the `using namespace std;` statement, which brings all the names from the `std` namespace into the global namespace. This can lead to naming conflicts and is generally considered bad practice. Instead, we can use `std::` prefix to specify the usage of names from the `std` namespace.
3. Use `std::cin` and `std::cout`: The program currently uses `cin` and `cout` without the `std::` prefix. We should use `std::cin` and `std::cout` to specify the usage of these objects from the `std` namespace.
4. Avoid unnecessary precision in printf format: The program uses `printf` with a format specifier `%.5f` to print the result with 5 decimal places. Since we are not dealing with floating-point numbers, we can remove the precision specifier.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <complex>
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  std::complex<double> P1, P2;
  std::cin >> P1.real() >> P1.imag() >> P2.real() >> P2.imag();
  std::cout << std::abs(P1 - P2) << "\n";
  return 0;
}
```
