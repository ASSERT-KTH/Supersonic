The given program calculates the distance between two points in a complex plane using the `abs` function. 

To optimize the program, we can avoid using the `complex` library and the `abs` function and instead use a direct mathematical formula to calculate the distance between two points.

The mathematical formula to calculate the distance between two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is:

distance = sqrt((x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2)

By using this formula, we can avoid the overhead of creating complex numbers and using the `abs` function.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <cmath>
#include <cstdio>
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  double x1, y1, x2, y2;
  cin >> x1 >> y1 >> x2 >> y2;
  double distance = sqrt((x2 - x1) * (x2 - x1) + (y2 - y1) * (y2 - y1));
  printf("%.5f\n", distance);
  return 0;
}
```

In the optimized program, we directly read the coordinates of the two points as `double` values. Then, we calculate the distance using the direct mathematical formula and print the result.
