The given program calculates the absolute difference between two complex numbers `P1` and `P2`. The program uses the `complex` class from the `<complex>` header to represent complex numbers.

To optimize the program, we can eliminate the use of the `complex` class since we are only interested in calculating the absolute difference between two complex numbers. We can directly use the formula for calculating the absolute difference between two complex numbers `abs(P1 - P2) = sqrt((P1.real() - P2.real())^2 + (P1.imag() - P2.imag())^2)`.

Here is the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <cmath>
#include <cstdio>
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  double real1, imag1, real2, imag2;
  cin >> real1 >> imag1 >> real2 >> imag2;
  
  double diffReal = real1 - real2;
  double diffImag = imag1 - imag2;
  
  double absoluteDiff = sqrt(diffReal * diffReal + diffImag * diffImag);
  
  printf("%.5f\n", absoluteDiff);
  
  return 0;
}
```

In the optimized version, we directly read the real and imaginary parts of the complex numbers into separate variables `real1`, `imag1`, `real2`, and `imag2`. We then calculate the difference between the real and imaginary parts separately using `diffReal = real1 - real2` and `diffImag = imag1 - imag2`. Finally, we calculate the absolute difference using the formula `sqrt(diffReal * diffReal + diffImag * diffImag)` and print the result.
