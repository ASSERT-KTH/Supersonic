The given program calculates the number of prime pairs that add up to a given number. The program starts by initializing a vector `isPrime` to track if a number is prime or not. It then marks all odd numbers as prime. Next, it uses the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to mark all multiples of prime numbers as not prime. Finally, it creates a vector `primes` to store all prime numbers.

The program then enters a loop to read input values. For each input value, it iterates through the `primes` vector and checks if there is a prime number less than or equal to half of the input value that, when added to the input value, results in a prime number. The count of such prime pairs is then printed.

To optimize the program, we can make the following modifications:

1. The initialization of the `isPrime` vector is unnecessary since all odd numbers are already marked as prime in the loop. So, we can remove the initialization line `isPrime[2] = true;`.
2. The inner loop in the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm can be optimized to start from `i * i` instead of `i + i`, as all smaller multiples of `i` would have already been marked as not prime by previous iterations of the outer loop. This reduces the number of iterations in the inner loop significantly.
3. Instead of using the `at` method for accessing elements of the `isPrime` vector, we can use the indexing operator `[]` for better performance. The `at` method performs bounds checking, which is unnecessary in this case as the loop condition ensures that we only access valid indices.
4. We can optimize the loop that checks for prime pairs by iterating only up to the square root of the input value. If a number `i` is greater than the square root of `n`, then `n - i` will be less than `i`, and we would have already counted that pair when `i` was smaller. This reduces the number of iterations and improves performance.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <cmath>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  const int MAX_NUMBER = 51000;
  vector<bool> isPrime(MAX_NUMBER + 1, true);
  
  for (int i = 3; i * i <= MAX_NUMBER; i += 2) {
    if (isPrime[i]) {
      for (int j = i * i; j <= MAX_NUMBER; j += i) {
        isPrime[j] = false;
      }
    }
  }
  
  vector<int> primes;
  primes.push_back(2);
  for (int i = 3; i <= MAX_NUMBER; i += 2) {
    if (isPrime[i])
      primes.push_back(i);
  }
  
  int n;
  while (cin >> n && n != 0) {
    int kotae = 0;
    int sqrtN = sqrt(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < primes.size() && primes[i] <= sqrtN; i++) {
      if (isPrime[n - primes[i]])
        kotae++;
    }
    cout << kotae << endl;
  }
  
  return 0;
}
```

By making these optimizations, we have improved the running time and reduced the memory usage of the program.
