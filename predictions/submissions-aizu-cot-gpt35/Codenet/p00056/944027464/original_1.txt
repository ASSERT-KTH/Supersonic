The given program finds the number of prime pairs whose sum is equal to the input number `n`. It first generates a list of prime numbers up to 51000 using the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm, and then iterates through the list to count the prime pairs.

To optimize the program for running time and memory usage, we can make the following improvements:

1. Use a more efficient data structure for storing prime numbers: Instead of using a vector, we can use a bitset to represent whether a number is prime or not. This will significantly reduce memory usage.

2. Use a more efficient algorithm for counting prime pairs: Instead of iterating through the list of primes, we can use a two-pointer approach to count the prime pairs. We can initialize two pointers, one at the beginning and one at the end of the prime list, and move them towards each other until they meet or cross each other.

3. Remove unnecessary checks: Since we are already generating the prime list up to 51000, we don't need to check if a prime number is less than or equal to `n/2`. We can directly count the prime pairs without this condition.

Here is the optimized program with the above optimizations:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <bitset>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  const int MAX = 51000;
  bitset<MAX + 1> isPrime;
  isPrime.set();
  
  isPrime[0] = isPrime[1] = false;
  for (int i = 2; i * i <= MAX; i++) {
    if (isPrime[i]) {
      for (int j = i * i; j <= MAX; j += i) {
        isPrime[j] = false;
      }
    }
  }
  
  vector<int> primes;
  for (int i = 2; i <= MAX; i++) {
    if (isPrime[i]) {
      primes.push_back(i);
    }
  }
  
  int n;
  while (cin >> n && n != 0) {
    int kotae = 0;
    int left = 0, right = primes.size() - 1;
    
    while (left <= right) {
      int sum = primes[left] + primes[right];
      if (sum == n) {
        kotae++;
        left++;
        right--;
      } else if (sum < n) {
        left++;
      } else {
        right--;
      }
    }
    
    cout << kotae << endl;
  }
  
  return 0;
}
```

Explanation of optimizations:

1. Use a bitset: We replace the vector `isPrime` with a bitset to represent whether a number is prime or not. This reduces the memory usage by a factor of 8, as each boolean value in the vector takes up 8 bits (1 byte) of memory. With the bitset, each boolean value takes up only 1 bit of memory.

2. Two-pointer approach: Instead of iterating through the list of primes using a for loop, we use two pointers (`left` and `right`) to count the prime pairs. We initialize `left` to the beginning of the prime list and `right` to the end of the prime list. We then move `left` and `right` towards each other until they meet or cross each other. This reduces the number of iterations required to count the prime pairs.

3. Remove unnecessary condition: Since we are already generating the prime list up to 51000, we don't need to check if a prime number is less than or equal to `n/2`. We can directly count the prime pairs without this condition. This further improves the running time of the program.

Overall, these optimizations reduce both the memory usage and running time of the program.
