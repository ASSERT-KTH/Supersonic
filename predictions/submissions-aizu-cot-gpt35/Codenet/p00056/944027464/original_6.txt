The given program generates a list of prime numbers up to 51000 using the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm and then counts the number of pairs of primes that add up to a given input number.

To optimize the program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Update the loop bounds: The loops in the program iterate up to 51000, but we only need to iterate up to the square root of 51000. This is because any non-prime number greater than the square root of 51000 will have a factor smaller than the square root, which would have already been marked as composite. We can calculate the square root once outside the loop and use it as the upper bound.

2. Use a bitset instead of a vector<bool>: The vector<bool> type is specialized to save space, but it can be slower to access individual elements. We can use a bitset instead, which is more efficient for this specific use case.

3. Optimize the inner loop: The inner loop that sets the multiples of each prime number as composite can be optimized. We can start from the square of the current prime number and increment by twice the prime number, since all even multiples have already been marked as composite in the previous loop.

4. Use a variable instead of calling size() in the loop condition: In the loop that counts the pairs of primes, we can store the size of the primes vector in a variable before the loop and use that variable in the loop condition, instead of calling size() in each iteration.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <bitset>
#include <vector>
#include <cmath>
using namespace std;

int main(void) {
  const int limit = 51000;
  const int sqrtLimit = sqrt(limit);

  bitset<limit + 1> isPrime;
  isPrime[2] = true;
  for (int i = 3; i <= limit; i += 2) {
    isPrime[i] = true;
  }
  for (int i = 3; i <= sqrtLimit; i += 2) {
    if (isPrime[i]) {
      for (int j = i * i; j <= limit; j += i * 2) {
        isPrime[j] = false;
      }
    }
  }

  vector<int> primes;
  primes.push_back(2);
  for (int i = 3; i <= limit; i += 2) {
    if (isPrime[i])
      primes.push_back(i);
  }

  int n;
  while (cin >> n && n != 0) {
    int kotae = 0;
    int primesSize = primes.size();
    for (int i = 0; i < primesSize; i++) {
      if (primes[i] <= n / 2) {
        if (isPrime[n - primes[i]])
          kotae++;
      }
    }
    cout << kotae << endl;
  }

  return 0;
}
```

These optimizations should improve both the running time and memory usage of the program.
