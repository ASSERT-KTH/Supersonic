Step 1: Reduce the range of the outer loop in the sieve of Eratosthenes

Currently, the outer loop of the sieve of Eratosthenes runs from 3 to 51000 in steps of 2. This means it checks all odd numbers up to 51000 for primality. However, we can reduce the range of this loop to sqrt(51000) since any composite number greater than sqrt(51000) will already have been marked as non-prime by a smaller prime divisor. This will significantly reduce the number of iterations in the nested loop.

Step 2: Optimize the inner loop in the sieve of Eratosthenes

The inner loop in the sieve of Eratosthenes currently starts from i + i and increments by i in each iteration. However, we can start the inner loop from i * i since all the smaller multiples of i have already been marked as non-prime. Additionally, we can increment the loop counter by 2 * i instead of i because all multiples of i are odd numbers. This optimization will further reduce the number of iterations in the inner loop.

Step 3: Avoid unnecessary vector resizing

The vector "isPrime" is initialized with a size of 51000 + 1, but we only need to store the primality information for numbers up to 51000. Resizing the vector is an expensive operation, so we can reduce the size of the vector to 51000.

Step 4: Use a more efficient container to store primes

Currently, the vector "primes" is used to store all primes up to 51000. However, we only need to store primes up to n / 2 for each input number n. Instead of storing all primes, we can use a set to store the primes up to n / 2. This will allow us to perform constant time lookup for primality checks.

Here is the optimized C++ program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <cmath>
#include <unordered_set>
using namespace std;

int main(void) {
  vector<bool> isPrime(51000, false);
  isPrime[2] = true;
  
  int sqrtLimit = sqrt(51000);
  
  for (int i = 3; i <= sqrtLimit; i += 2) {
    if (isPrime[i]) {
      for (int j = i * i; j < 51000; j += 2 * i) {
        isPrime[j] = false;
      }
    }
  }
  
  unordered_set<int> primes;
  primes.insert(2);
  
  for (int i = 3; i < 51000; i += 2) {
    if (isPrime[i])
      primes.insert(i);
  }
  
  int n;
  while (cin >> n && n != 0) {
    int kotae = 0;
    int limit = n / 2;
    for (int prime : primes) {
      if (prime > limit)
        break;
      if (primes.count(n - prime))
        kotae++;
    }
    cout << kotae << endl;
  }
  
  return 0;
}
```

Explanation of optimizations:

1. The range of the outer loop in the sieve of Eratosthenes is reduced from 3 to sqrt(51000) to eliminate unnecessary iterations.

2. The inner loop in the sieve of Eratosthenes now starts from i * i and increments by 2 * i to skip unnecessary iterations.

3. The size of the vector "isPrime" is reduced to 51000 to avoid unnecessary resizing.

4. The vector "primes" is replaced with an unordered_set to store primes up to n / 2, reducing memory usage and allowing constant time lookup for primality checks.
