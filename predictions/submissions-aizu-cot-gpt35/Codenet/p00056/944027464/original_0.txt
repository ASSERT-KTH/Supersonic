The given program generates a list of prime numbers up to 51000 and then uses this list to find pairs of prime numbers that sum up to the given input.

To optimize this program, we can make the following improvements:

1. Use a more efficient algorithm to generate the list of prime numbers.
2. Use a more efficient data structure to store the list of prime numbers.
3. Use a different approach to count the pairs of prime numbers.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <bitset>
using namespace std;

int main(void) {
  const int MAX_N = 51000;
  bitset<MAX_N + 1> isPrime;
  isPrime.set(); // set all bits to 1

  for (int i = 2; i * i <= MAX_N; i++) {
    if (isPrime[i]) {
      for (int j = i * i; j <= MAX_N; j += i) {
        isPrime[j] = false;
      }
    }
  }

  vector<int> primes;
  for (int i = 2; i <= MAX_N; i++) {
    if (isPrime[i])
      primes.push_back(i);
  }

  int n;
  while (cin >> n && n != 0) {
    int kotae = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < primes.size() && primes[i] <= n / 2; i++) {
      if (isPrime[n - primes[i]])
        kotae++;
    }
    cout << kotae << endl;
  }

  return 0;
}
```

Explanation of optimizations:

1. Using the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm: The original program used a simple loop to mark non-prime numbers. The Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm is much more efficient for generating prime numbers. It iterates over the numbers and marks their multiples as non-prime. This reduces the number of iterations required.
2. Using `std::bitset` for storing prime numbers: The original program used a `std::vector<bool>` to store the prime numbers. This data structure is not memory-efficient because it uses one byte per boolean value. `std::bitset` is a more memory-efficient data structure that uses a fixed number of bits. In this case, we can use `std::bitset<MAX_N + 1>` to store the prime numbers up to 51000.
3. Optimizing the counting of pairs: The original program used a nested loop to count the pairs of prime numbers. Instead, we can use a single loop and check if the difference between the current prime number and the input number is also a prime number. This reduces the number of iterations required.

These optimizations improve the running time and memory usage of the program.
