This program generates a list of prime numbers up to 51000 using the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm, and then for each input number, it counts the number of pairs of prime numbers whose sum is equal to the input number.

To optimize this program, we can make the following changes:

1. Change the data type of `isPrime` to `vector<char>` instead of `vector<bool>`. This will reduce the memory usage because `vector<bool>` uses a specialized implementation that stores each boolean value as a single bit. However, accessing individual bits can be slower than accessing whole bytes. Therefore, using `vector<char>` will result in better performance.

2. Instead of using `isPrime.at(n - primes[i])` to check if the difference is prime, we can directly access the element using `isPrime[n - primes[i]]`. This will eliminate the range checking overhead of `at()` and improve the program's performance.

3. Instead of iterating through all the prime numbers up to `n/2`, we can optimize the loop by using a binary search to find the index of the largest prime number less than or equal to `n/2`. We can then iterate only up to that index and count the number of pairs. This will reduce the number of iterations and improve the program's performance.

Here is the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int main(void) {
  vector<char> isPrime(51000 + 1, false);
  isPrime[2] = true;

  for (int i = 3; i < 51000; i += 2) {
    isPrime[i] = true;
  }

  for (int i = 3; i < 51000; i += 2) {
    if (isPrime[i]) {
      for (int j = i + i; j < 51000; j += i) {
        isPrime[j] = false;
      }
    }
  }

  vector<int> primes;
  primes.push_back(2);

  for (int i = 3; i < 51000; i += 2) {
    if (isPrime[i]) {
      primes.push_back(i);
    }
  }

  int n;
  while (cin >> n && n != 0) {
    int kotae = 0;
    int maxSize = n / 2;
    int left = 0;
    int right = primes.size() - 1;
    int lastIndex = -1;

    while (left <= right) {
      int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;

      if (primes[mid] <= maxSize) {
        lastIndex = mid;
        left = mid + 1;
      } else {
        right = mid - 1;
      }
    }

    for (int i = 0; i <= lastIndex; i++) {
      if (isPrime[n - primes[i]]) {
        kotae++;
      }
    }

    cout << kotae << endl;
  }

  return 0;
}
```

This optimized version reduces memory usage by using `vector<char>` instead of `vector<bool>`, improves the loop by using binary search, and eliminates the range checking overhead of `at()`. These optimizations should result in better performance for both running time and memory usage.
