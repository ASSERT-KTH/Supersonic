Step 1: Remove unnecessary inclusion of the `<iostream>` header file since it is not being used in the program.

Step 2: Instead of using a vector of type bool to store prime numbers, we can use a vector of type char to reduce memory usage. This is because the bool type typically takes up 1 byte of memory, whereas char typically takes up only 1 bit of memory.

Step 3: Instead of initializing the vector `isPrime` with a size of 51001 and setting all elements to false, we can initialize it with a size of (51001 + 1) / 2 and set all elements to '\x01'. This is because we only need to store information about odd numbers in the vector, as even numbers are not prime.

Step 4: In the second for loop, change the loop condition from `i < 51000` to `i < isPrime.size()`, since the size of the vector may change if step 3 is implemented.

Step 5: In the second for loop, change the loop condition from `j < 51000` to `j < isPrime.size()`, since the size of the vector may change if step 3 is implemented.

Step 6: Instead of using `push_back` to add elements to the `primes` vector, we can use the `emplace_back` function, which constructs the element in place, reducing the number of unnecessary copy operations.

Step 7: In the last for loop, change the loop condition from `i < primes.size()` to `i < primes.size() && primes[i] <= n / 2`, since there is no need to check prime numbers greater than n / 2.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int main(void) {
  vector<char> isPrime((51000 + 1) / 2, '\x01');
  isPrime[0] = '\0'; // 1 is not prime
  for (int i = 3; i * i <= 51000; i += 2) {
    if (isPrime[i / 2]) {
      for (int j = i * i; j <= 51000; j += 2 * i) {
        isPrime[j / 2] = '\0';
      }
    }
  }
  vector<int> primes;
  primes.emplace_back(2);
  for (int i = 3; i <= 51000; i += 2) {
    if (isPrime[i / 2])
      primes.emplace_back(i);
  }
  int n;
  while (cin >> n && n != 0) {
    int kotae = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < primes.size() && primes[i] <= n / 2; i++) {
      if (isPrime[(n - primes[i]) / 2])
        kotae++;
    }
    cout << kotae << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Note: The optimization steps mentioned above are just suggestions for improving the program's running time and memory usage. The actual performance improvements may vary depending on the compiler and system environment.
