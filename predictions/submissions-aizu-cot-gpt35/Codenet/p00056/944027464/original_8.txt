The given program generates all prime numbers up to 51000 and then for each input number `n`, it calculates the number of prime pairs `(p, q)` such that `p + q = n`.

To optimize the program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Instead of using a `vector<bool>` to store the prime numbers, we can use a `vector<char>`, which will reduce the memory usage by a factor of 8.

2. We can optimize the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm by starting the inner loop from `i * i` instead of `i + i`. This is because all the multiples of `i` less than `i * i` have already been marked as composite by previous iterations.

3. We can use a separate loop to count the number of prime pairs `(p, q)` instead of iterating over the `primes` vector. This will reduce the number of iterations and improve the running time.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int main(void) {
  vector<char> isPrime(51000 + 1, 0);
  isPrime[2] = 1;

  for (int i = 3; i * i <= 51000; i += 2) {
    if (!isPrime[i]) {
      for (int j = i * i; j <= 51000; j += i) {
        isPrime[j] = 1;
      }
    }
  }

  vector<int> primes;
  primes.push_back(2);
  for (int i = 3; i <= 51000; i += 2) {
    if (!isPrime[i])
      primes.push_back(i);
  }

  int n;
  while (cin >> n && n != 0) {
    int kotae = 0;
    for (int i = 0; primes[i] <= n / 2; i++) {
      if (!isPrime[n - primes[i]])
        kotae++;
    }
    cout << kotae << endl;
  }

  return 0;
}
```

This optimized program reduces the memory usage by using `vector<char>` instead of `vector<bool>` and improves the running time by optimizing the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm and using a separate loop for counting the number of prime pairs.
