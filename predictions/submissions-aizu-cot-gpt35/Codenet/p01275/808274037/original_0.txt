The given program is using a recursive function `rec` to calculate the minimum number of rotations required to transform one string into another. The program initializes an array `dif` to store the difference between the characters of the two strings.

To optimize the program, we can use dynamic programming to avoid redundant calculations and improve the running time and memory usage. We can create a 2D array `dp` to store the minimum number of rotations required for each prefix of the strings. The dimensions of the array will be `k+1` by `M`, where `k` is the length of the strings and `M` is a constant.

Here are the steps to optimize the program:

1. Remove the global variables `k` and `ans` as they are not required.

2. Move the `rec` function inside the `main` function as a nested function.

3. Create a 2D array `dp` of size `(k+1) x M` and initialize all elements to a large value like `INT_MAX`.

4. Modify the recursive logic to use the `dp` array. Instead of directly modifying the `dif` array, we will pass the current state of `dif` as an argument to the recursive function.

5. Update the base case of the recursion. Instead of setting `ans = d`, we will update `dp[p][d]` to `0` to represent that the current state has been reached.

6. Update the recursive calls to use the `dp` array. Instead of calling `rec(d, p+1)`, we will call `rec(dp[p][d], p+1)` to use the minimum number of rotations from the current state.

7. Update the loop to calculate the new `dif` array. Instead of modifying the `dif` array directly, we will create a new array `new_dif` and update its values using the current `dif` array and `rot`.

8. Update the recursive calls inside the loop to use the new `dif` array. Instead of calling `rec(d+1, p+1)`, we will call `rec(dp[p][d]+1, p+1)` to use the updated `dif` array.

9. Print the value of `dp[0][0]` at the end of each test case to get the minimum number of rotations required.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <climits>
using namespace std;

const int M = 10;

void mainFunction() {
    int k;
    while (cin >> k, k) {
        string s, t;
        cin >> s >> t;

        int dp[k+1][M];
        for (int i = 0; i <= k; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < M; j++) {
                dp[i][j] = INT_MAX;
            }
        }
        dp[k][0] = 0;

        for (int p = k-1; p >= 0; p--) {
            for (int d = 0; d < M; d++) {
                int rot = ((int)(t[p] - s[p]) + M) % M;
                int new_dif[k];
                for (int i = p; i < k; i++) {
                    new_dif[i] = (dp[p+1][d] + d) % M;
                }

                for (int i = p; i < k; i++) {
                    new_dif[i] = (new_dif[i] - rot + M) % M;
                    dp[p][d] = min(dp[p][d], dp[p+1][new_dif[i]] + 1);
                    new_dif[i] = (new_dif[i] + rot) % M;
                }
            }
        }

        cout << dp[0][0] << endl;
    }
}

int main() {
    mainFunction();
    return 0;
}
```

This optimized program uses dynamic programming to avoid redundant calculations and improve the running time and memory usage. The use of the `dp` array allows us to store and reuse the minimum number of rotations required for each prefix of the strings.
