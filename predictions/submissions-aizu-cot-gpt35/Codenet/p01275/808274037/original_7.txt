Step 1: Remove unnecessary global variables

In the given program, the variables `k` and `ans` are used as global variables. It is best practice to avoid using global variables whenever possible. In this case, we can move these variables inside the main function and pass them as arguments to the `rec` function.

Step 2: Avoid unnecessary calculations

The program currently calculates the difference between the characters `t[i]` and `s[i]` inside the loop. However, this difference can be calculated once and stored in a variable before the loop starts. This will avoid redundant calculations inside the loop.

Step 3: Optimize the recursion

The recursion in the `rec` function can be optimized by removing unnecessary recursive calls. Currently, the function makes multiple recursive calls in the loop. However, we can optimize this by calculating the new value of `dif[i]` inside the loop without making recursive calls. Then, we can use a single recursive call after the loop to process the remaining differences.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

const int M = 10;

int rec(int d, int p, int k, int* dif, int ans) {
  if (p == k) {
    return d;
  }
  if (d >= ans) {
    return ans;
  }

  int rot = dif[p];
  if (rot == 0) {
    return rec(d, p + 1, k, dif, ans);
  }

  int min_d = ans;
  for (int i = p; i < k; i++) {
    dif[i] = (dif[i] - rot) % M;
    min_d = min(min_d, rec(d + 1, p + 1, k, dif, ans));
    dif[i] = (dif[i] + rot + M) % M;
  }

  return min_d;
}

int main() {
  int k;
  while (cin >> k, k) {
    string s, t;
    cin >> s >> t;
    int dif[k];
    for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
      dif[i] = ((int)(t[i] - s[i]) + M) % M;
    }
    int ans = k;
    cout << rec(0, 0, k, dif, ans) << endl;
  }
}
```
