The given program is finding pairs of prime numbers (p, q) such that p is 2 less than q and both p and q are prime. The program takes an input integer n and finds the largest pair (p, q) such that p and q are prime and p is less than or equal to n.

To optimize the program, we can make the following modifications:

1. In the `isprime1` function, we can optimize the loop by checking only up to the square root of n. If n is divisible by any number up to its square root, it will also be divisible by a number greater than its square root. Therefore, we can reduce the loop iteration from `i < n` to `i <= sqrt(n)`.

2. In the main function, we can reduce the number of iterations in the for loop by starting from n - (n % 2) instead of n. This way, we ensure that the loop starts from an even number, and we only check even numbers for primality. This is because the required prime pairs (p, q) always have p as an even number.

3. We can further optimize the for loop by checking only odd numbers. Since p is always an even number, we can start the loop from n - (n % 2) - 1 and decrement i by 2 in each iteration.

4. We can remove the unnecessary check `n >= 5` in the for loop condition since the loop will naturally terminate when i becomes less than 5.

Here is the optimized program:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <math.h>

int isprime1(int n) {
  int i;
  for (i = 2; i <= sqrt(n); i++) {
    if (n % i == 0)
      return 0;
  }
  return 1;
}

int main() {
  int n, p, q, i;
  scanf("%d", &n);
  while (1) {
    if (n == 0)
      break;
    for (i = n - (n % 2) - 1; i >= 5; i -= 2) {
      if (isprime1(i) == 1 && isprime1(i - 2) == 1) {
        p = i - 2;
        q = i;
        break;
      }
    }
    printf("%d %d\n", p, q);
    scanf("%d", &n);
  }
  return 0;
}
```

The optimized program reduces the number of iterations in the for loop and improves the efficiency of the primality check by only checking up to the square root of the number. This should result in a significant improvement in both running time and memory usage.
