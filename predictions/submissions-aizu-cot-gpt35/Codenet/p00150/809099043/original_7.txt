The given C program finds pairs of prime numbers (p, q) such that p = q - 2 and p and q are both prime numbers. The program takes an integer n as input and repeatedly finds pairs until n becomes 0.

To optimize the program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Change the isprime1 function to only check prime numbers up to the square root of n. This is because if n is divisible by a number greater than its square root, then it must also be divisible by a number smaller than its square root. This optimization reduces the number of iterations in the for loop.

2. Initialize p and q outside of the while loop to avoid unnecessary assignments in each iteration.

Here is the optimized C program:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <math.h>

int isprime1(int n) {
  if (n <= 1) {
    return 0;
  }
  for (int i = 2; i <= sqrt(n); i++) {
    if (n % i == 0) {
      return 0;
    }
  }
  return 1;
}

int main() {
  int n, p = 0, q = 0;
  scanf("%d", &n);
  while (n != 0) {
    for (int i = n; i >= 5; i--) {
      if (isprime1(i) && isprime1(i - 2)) {
        p = i - 2;
        q = i;
        break;
      }
    }
    printf("%d %d\n", p, q);
    scanf("%d", &n);
  }
  return 0;
}
```

By applying these optimizations, we reduce the number of iterations in the isprime1 function and eliminate unnecessary assignments within the while loop. This results in improved running time and memory usage.
