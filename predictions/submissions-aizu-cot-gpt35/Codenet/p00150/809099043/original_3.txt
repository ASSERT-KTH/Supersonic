Step 1: Optimize the isprime1 function
- The isprime1 function is used to check if a number is prime.
- Currently, it checks divisibility by all numbers from 2 to n-1.
- We can improve the performance by checking divisibility only up to the square root of n.
- Also, we can handle the cases where n is 2 or 3 separately, as they are prime numbers.

Step 2: Optimize the main function
- The main function finds pairs of prime numbers (p, q) such that p = q - 2.
- However, it starts the search from n and goes down to 5.
- Instead, we can start the search from n - 2 and go down to 5 in steps of 2.
- This way, we can directly check if both i and i - 2 are prime, without needing to call the isprime1 function.

Step 3: Remove unnecessary break statement
- The break statement in the main function is used to exit the loop once a pair of prime numbers is found.
- However, we can remove this break statement and print the pair immediately, as there is no need to continue the loop.

Here is the optimized C++ program:

```cpp
#include <stdio.h>
#include <math.h>

int isprime1(int n) {
  if (n == 2 || n == 3)
    return 1;
  if (n % 2 == 0 || n % 3 == 0)
    return 0;
  int i = 5;
  int w = 2;
  while (i * i <= n) {
    if (n % i == 0)
      return 0;
    i += w;
    w = 6 - w;
  }
  return 1;
}

int main() {
  int n, p, q;
  scanf("%d", &n);
  while (n != 0) {
    for (int i = n - 2; i >= 5; i -= 2) {
      if (isprime1(i) && isprime1(i - 2)) {
        p = i - 2;
        q = i;
        printf("%d %d\n", p, q);
        break;
      }
    }
    scanf("%d", &n);
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Explanation:
- In the isprime1 function, we handle the cases where n is 2 or 3 separately. Then, we use a loop to check divisibility only up to the square root of n, incrementing i by 2 and alternating the value of w between 2 and 4 to check divisibility by numbers of the form 6k Â± 1.
- In the main function, we start the search from n - 2 and go down in steps of 2. We directly check if both i and i - 2 are prime using the isprime1 function. Once a pair is found, we print it and continue with the next input.
