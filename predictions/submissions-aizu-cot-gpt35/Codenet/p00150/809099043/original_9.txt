The given program is finding twin primes up to the given input number `n`. A twin prime is a prime number that is either 2 less or 2 more than another prime number.

To optimize the program, we can make the following modifications:

1. In the `isprime1` function, instead of checking divisibility up to `n-1`, we can check divisibility up to `n/2`. This is because if a number `n` is divisible by any number greater than `n/2`, it would have already been found when checking divisibility up to `n-1`.

2. In the main function, we can optimize the twin prime search loop by starting from the largest possible twin prime candidate `n` and decrementing it by 2 in each iteration. We can also break the loop as soon as we find a twin prime pair.

Here is the optimized program:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int isprime1(int n) {
  int i;
  for (i = 2; i <= n/2; i++) {
    if (n % i == 0)
      return 0;
  }
  return 1;
}

int main() {
  int n, p, q, i;
  scanf("%d", &n);
  while (n != 0) {
    for (i = n; i >= 5; i -= 2) {
      if (isprime1(i) == 1 && isprime1(i - 2) == 1) {
        p = i - 2;
        q = i;
        break;
      }
    }
    printf("%d %d\n", p, q);
    scanf("%d", &n);
  }
  return 0;
}
```

With these optimizations, the program will have improved performance in terms of running time and memory usage.
