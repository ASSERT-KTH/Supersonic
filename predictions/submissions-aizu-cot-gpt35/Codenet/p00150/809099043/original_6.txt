The given program has two major areas that can be optimized:

1. The isprime1 function: This function checks if a number is prime by iterating from 2 to n-1 and checking if n is divisible by any of the numbers in that range. This approach is not efficient, as we can stop checking for divisibility at the square root of n. Additionally, we can optimize the loop by starting from 2 and incrementing by 2, as even numbers greater than 2 cannot be prime.

2. The nested for loop in the main function: This loop finds the largest pair of prime numbers (p, q) such that p = q - 2. The loop starts from n and iterates downwards until it finds a suitable pair. However, there is no need to check for pairs where q - p > 2, as the problem only requires pairs where q - p = 2. We can modify the loop to iterate from n to 5 and decrement by 2, and stop as soon as we find a suitable pair.

Now, let's generate the optimized program:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <math.h>

int isprime(int n) {
  if (n < 2)
    return 0;
  if (n == 2)
    return 1;
  if (n % 2 == 0)
    return 0;
  
  int sqrt_n = (int) sqrt(n);
  for (int i = 3; i <= sqrt_n; i += 2) {
    if (n % i == 0)
      return 0;
  }
  return 1;
}

int main() {
  int n, p, q;
  
  scanf("%d", &n);
  while (n != 0) {
    for (int i = n; i >= 5; i -= 2) {
      if (isprime(i) && isprime(i - 2)) {
        p = i - 2;
        q = i;
        break;
      }
    }
    printf("%d %d\n", p, q);
    scanf("%d", &n);
  }
  
  return 0;
}
```

In the optimized program:

1. The isprime1 function is renamed to isprime.
2. The isprime function checks if the given number is less than 2 and returns 0. Then it checks if the number is 2 and returns 1. Finally, it checks if the number is divisible by 2 and returns 0. After that, it iterates from 3 to the square root of n, incrementing by 2, to check for divisibility. This optimization reduces the number of iterations and improves the running time.
3. The nested for loop in the main function is modified to iterate from n to 5, decrementing by 2. This optimization reduces the number of iterations and improves the running time.
4. The condition `while (1)` is changed to `while (n != 0)` to make the loop condition clearer.
5. The variable `i` in the main function is moved inside the loop, as it is only used within the loop. This improves readability and reduces the scope of the variable.
