The given program tries to find pairs of prime numbers (p, q) such that p and q differ by 2, and p and q are both less than or equal to the given input number n.

To optimize the program, we can make the following changes:

1. In the `isprime1` function, instead of iterating from 2 to n-1 to check for divisibility, we can iterate from 2 to the square root of n. This is because if n is divisible by any number greater than its square root, it must also be divisible by a number smaller than its square root. This reduces the number of iterations required.

2. In the main function, we can initialize the variables p and q to -1 before the loop. This is because if no pair of prime numbers satisfying the condition is found, we can check if p and q are still -1 after the loop and print an appropriate message.

3. We can add a flag variable `found` to indicate whether a pair of prime numbers satisfying the condition is found. We can set the flag to 1 when a pair is found and break out of the loop.

4. We can modify the loop condition to `i >= 5` instead of `n >= 5`, as we are iterating from n to 5.

Here is the optimized program:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <math.h>

int isprime1(int n) {
  int i;
  for (i = 2; i <= sqrt(n); i++) {
    if (n % i == 0)
      return 0;
  }
  return 1;
}

int main() {
  int n, p = -1, q = -1, i, found = 0;
  scanf("%d", &n);
  
  while (1) {
    if (n == 0)
      break;
    for (i = n; i >= 5; i--) {
      if (isprime1(i) == 1 && isprime1(i - 2) == 1) {
        p = i - 2;
        q = i;
        found = 1;
        break;
      }
    }
    if (found) {
      printf("%d %d\n", p, q);
    } else {
      printf("No prime pair found\n");
    }
    scanf("%d", &n);
    found = 0;
    p = -1;
    q = -1;
  }
  
  return 0;
}
```
