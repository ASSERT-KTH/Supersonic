The given program is a sorting program that sorts a deck of cards based on their values using two different sorting algorithms: Bubble Sort and Selection Sort. The program then checks if the sorting is stable, meaning if cards with the same value are in the same order before and after sorting.

To optimize the program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove the unnecessary `swap_Card` function since it is not used in the program.

2. Combine the two sorting functions into a single function, eliminating duplicate code.

3. Remove the duplicate loop for printing the sorted cards and checking stability.

4. Replace the `scanf` calls with `cin` for better input handling.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

typedef struct {
  char suit;
  int value;
} Card;

void sortCards(Card A[], int N) {
  for (int i = 0; i < N - 1; i++) {
    for (int j = N - 1; j > i; j--) {
      if (A[j].value < A[j - 1].value) {
        swap(A[j], A[j - 1]);
      }
    }
  }
}

int main() {
  int N;
  cin >> N;

  Card BC[36];
  Card SC[36];

  for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
    cin >> BC[i].suit >> BC[i].value;
    SC[i] = BC[i];
  }

  sortCards(BC, N);
  sort(SC, SC + N, [](Card a, Card b) {
    return a.value < b.value;
  });

  for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
    cout << BC[i].suit << BC[i].value << " ";
  }
  cout << endl;

  if (equal(BC, BC + N, SC, [](Card a, Card b) {
    return a.suit == b.suit && a.value == b.value;
  })) {
    cout << "Stable" << endl;
  } else {
    cout << "Not stable" << endl;
  }

  for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
    cout << SC[i].suit << SC[i].value << " ";
  }
  cout << endl;

  return 0;
}
```

Explanation of optimization steps:

1. The `swap_Card` function is not used in the program, so it can be safely removed.

2. The two sorting functions, BubbleSort and SelectionSort, are combined into a single function called `sortCards`. This eliminates duplicate code and improves code maintainability.

3. The duplicate loop for printing the sorted cards and checking stability is removed. Instead, the `equal` function from the algorithm library is used to check if the two arrays `BC` and `SC` are equal.

4. The `scanf` calls are replaced with `cin` for better input handling and to avoid potential buffer overflow issues.

These optimizations should improve the running time and memory usage of the program.
