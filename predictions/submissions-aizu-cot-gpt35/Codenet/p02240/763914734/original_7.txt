The main bottleneck in this program is the `makeGroup()` function. It uses a breadth-first search algorithm to assign group numbers to each node in the graph. However, it has a nested loop that iterates over the number of neighbors of each node, resulting in a time complexity of O(n * m), where n is the number of nodes and m is the number of edges.

To optimize this program, we can modify the `makeGroup()` function to use a depth-first search algorithm instead of a breadth-first search. This will reduce the time complexity to O(n + m) and improve the overall performance of the program.

Here's the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <queue>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;
class Relation {
public:
  Relation(int tmp_n, int tmp_m) {
    n = tmp_n;
    m = tmp_m;
    V = new vector<int>[n];
    num_of_each = new int[n];
    group = new int[n];
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      num_of_each[i] = 0;
      group[i] = 0;
    }
    group_number = 1;
  }
  void push(int s, int t) {
    V[s].push_back(t);
    V[t].push_back(s);
    num_of_each[s]++;
    num_of_each[t]++;
  }
  void makeGroup() {
    int node;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      if (group[i] == 0) {
        group[i] = group_number;
        dfs(i);
        group_number++;
      }
    }
  }
  void dfs(int node) {
    for (int k = 0; k < num_of_each[node]; k++) {
      if (group[V[node][k]] == 0) {
        group[V[node][k]] = group[node];
        dfs(V[node][k]);
      }
    }
  }
  bool canAccsess(int s, int t) { return group[s] == group[t]; }

private:
  vector<int> *V;
  int *num_of_each;
  int *group;
  int group_number;
  int n, m;
};
int main() {
  int n, m, s, t, q;
  scanf("%d %d", &n, &m);
  Relation relation(n, m);
  for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
    scanf("%d %d", &s, &t);
    relation.push(s, t);
  }
  relation.makeGroup();
  scanf("%d", &q);
  for (int i = 0; i < q; i++) {
    scanf("%d %d", &s, &t);
    if (relation.canAccsess(s, t)) {
      printf("yes\n");
    } else {
      printf("no\n");
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Explanation:

1. In the `makeGroup()` function, we replace the breadth-first search with a depth-first search algorithm.
2. Instead of using a queue to store nodes, we use recursion to perform the depth-first search.
3. The `dfs()` function is introduced to perform the recursive depth-first search.
4. We remove the nested loop in the `makeGroup()` function and iterate over all nodes in the graph.
5. If a node is not assigned to a group, we assign it to a new group and perform the depth-first search from that node.
6. The depth-first search assigns group numbers to all connected nodes in the graph.
7. Finally, we update the group number and repeat the process for any remaining unassigned nodes.
8. The time complexity of the `makeGroup()` function is reduced from O(n * m) to O(n + m), resulting in improved performance.
