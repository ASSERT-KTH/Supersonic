Step 1: Remove unnecessary includes

The program includes the `<algorithm>` header, but it doesn't use any functions from it. Therefore, we can remove this include statement to improve compilation time and reduce memory usage.

Step 2: Use a vector of vectors instead of an array of vectors

Currently, the program uses a dynamically allocated array of vectors to represent the graph. However, using a vector of vectors can simplify the code and improve memory management. We can replace the following lines of code:

```cpp
V = new vector<int>[n];
```

with

```cpp
V.resize(n);
```

Step 3: Remove unnecessary initialization of num_of_each array

The num_of_each array is initialized to zero in the constructor, but it is immediately updated with the correct values in the push() function. Therefore, the initialization in the constructor is unnecessary and can be removed.

Step 4: Improve the makeGroup() function

The makeGroup() function uses a queue to perform a breadth-first search algorithm to assign group numbers to the nodes. However, it can be simplified and optimized by using a single loop instead of nested loops.

Here's the optimized code:

```cpp
void makeGroup() {
  int group_number = 1;
  queue<int> Q;
  vector<bool> visited(n, false);

  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    if (!visited[i]) {
      Q.push(i);
      group[i] = group_number;
      visited[i] = true;

      while (!Q.empty()) {
        int node = Q.front();
        Q.pop();

        for (int neighbor : V[node]) {
          if (!visited[neighbor]) {
            group[neighbor] = group_number;
            visited[neighbor] = true;
            Q.push(neighbor);
          }
        }
      }

      group_number++;
    }
  }
}
```

Step 5: Optimize input/output operations

The program currently uses `scanf()` and `printf()` for input and output operations. While these functions are generally fast, using `cin` and `cout` from the `<iostream>` header can provide even better performance. We can replace the following lines of code:

```cpp
scanf("%d %d", &n, &m);
```

with

```cpp
cin >> n >> m;
```

and replace

```cpp
printf("yes\n");
```

with

```cpp
cout << "yes" << endl;
```

Here's the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

class Relation {
public:
  Relation(int tmp_n, int tmp_m) {
    n = tmp_n;
    m = tmp_m;
    V.resize(n);
    group.resize(n);
  }

  void push(int s, int t) {
    V[s].push_back(t);
    V[t].push_back(s);
  }

  void makeGroup() {
    int group_number = 1;
    queue<int> Q;
    vector<bool> visited(n, false);

    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      if (!visited[i]) {
        Q.push(i);
        group[i] = group_number;
        visited[i] = true;

        while (!Q.empty()) {
          int node = Q.front();
          Q.pop();

          for (int neighbor : V[node]) {
            if (!visited[neighbor]) {
              group[neighbor] = group_number;
              visited[neighbor] = true;
              Q.push(neighbor);
            }
          }
        }

        group_number++;
      }
    }
  }

  bool canAccess(int s, int t) { return group[s] == group[t]; }

private:
  vector<vector<int>> V;
  vector<int> group;
  int n, m;
};

int main() {
  int n, m, s, t, q;
  cin >> n >> m;
  Relation relation(n, m);

  for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
    cin >> s >> t;
    relation.push(s, t);
  }

  relation.makeGroup();

  cin >> q;

  for (int i = 0; i < q; i++) {
    cin >> s >> t;

    if (relation.canAccess(s, t)) {
      cout << "yes" << endl;
    } else {
      cout << "no" << endl;
    }
  }

  return 0;
}
```
