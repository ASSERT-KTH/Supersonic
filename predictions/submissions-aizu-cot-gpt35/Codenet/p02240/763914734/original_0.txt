The given program is a C++ program that creates a graph of nodes and checks if two nodes are in the same group. The program uses a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to assign groups to each node and then checks if two nodes are in the same group.

To optimize the program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The program includes the `<algorithm>` header, but it is not used. We can remove this include statement.

2. Avoid dynamic memory allocation: The program uses dynamic memory allocation to create vectors for each node and arrays for other data. Instead of dynamically allocating memory, we can use static arrays and vectors to avoid memory allocation overhead.

3. Use `vector` size method instead of tracking the number of elements separately: The program tracks the number of elements for each node in the `num_of_each` array. Instead, we can use the `size()` method of the `vector` to get the number of elements.

4. Optimize the BFS algorithm: The current BFS algorithm uses a nested loop to iterate over the neighbors of each node. We can optimize this by using a single loop and a visited array to keep track of visited nodes.

5. Optimize the group assignment loop: The current loop for assigning groups starts from the first node and searches for unassigned nodes. We can optimize this loop by using a loop with a known number of iterations.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <cstdio>
#include <vector>
#include <queue>

class Relation {
public:
    Relation(int tmp_n, int tmp_m) {
        n = tmp_n;
        m = tmp_m;
        V.resize(n);
        group.resize(n);
    }

    void push(int s, int t) {
        V[s].push_back(t);
        V[t].push_back(s);
    }

    void makeGroup() {
        int group_number = 1;
        std::vector<bool> visited(n, false);
        std::queue<int> Q;

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (!visited[i]) {
                Q.push(i);
                group[i] = group_number;
                visited[i] = true;

                while (!Q.empty()) {
                    int node = Q.front();
                    Q.pop();

                    for (int neighbor : V[node]) {
                        if (!visited[neighbor]) {
                            Q.push(neighbor);
                            group[neighbor] = group_number;
                            visited[neighbor] = true;
                        }
                    }
                }

                group_number++;
            }
        }
    }

    bool canAccess(int s, int t) {
        return group[s] == group[t];
    }

private:
    std::vector<std::vector<int>> V;
    std::vector<int> group;
    int n, m;
};

int main() {
    int n, m, s, t, q;
    std::scanf("%d %d", &n, &m);
    Relation relation(n, m);

    for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
        std::scanf("%d %d", &s, &t);
        relation.push(s, t);
    }

    relation.makeGroup();

    std::scanf("%d", &q);

    for (int i = 0; i < q; i++) {
        std::scanf("%d %d", &s, &t);
        if (relation.canAccess(s, t)) {
            std::printf("yes\n");
        } else {
            std::printf("no\n");
        }
    }

    return 0;
}
```

Explanation of optimizations:

1. Removed unnecessary includes: The `<algorithm>` header was removed because it is not used in the program.

2. Avoided dynamic memory allocation: The `V` vector and `group` vector were used instead of dynamically allocating memory using `new`.

3. Used `vector` size method: The `num_of_each` array was replaced with the `size()` method of the `vector` to get the number of elements.

4. Optimized BFS algorithm: The nested loop in the BFS algorithm was replaced with a single loop that iterates over the neighbors of each node. The visited array is used to keep track of visited nodes.

5. Optimized the group assignment loop: The loop for assigning groups starts from 0 and goes up to `n`. This loop has a known number of iterations, which avoids the need for a break statement.

These optimizations help improve the running time and memory usage of the program.
