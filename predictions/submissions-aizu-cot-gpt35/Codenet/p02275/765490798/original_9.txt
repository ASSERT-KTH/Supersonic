The given program uses counting sort to sort a vector of integers. The counting sort algorithm has a time complexity of O(n + k), where n is the size of the input vector and k is the range of the input values. 

To optimize the program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The program includes the "bits/stdc++.h" header, which includes a large number of standard C++ headers. This can increase compilation time and memory usage. We can remove this include and only include the necessary headers.

2. Remove unnecessary debug code: The program includes a conditional include "dump.hpp" for debugging purposes. We can remove this code as it is not necessary for the optimized program.

3. Replace the use of the "max_element" function: The program uses the "max_element" function to find the maximum element in the input vector. Instead of using this function, we can manually find the maximum element in a single pass.

4. Use reserve for vector: Before reading the input, we can use the "reserve" function to allocate memory for the vector. This can reduce the number of reallocations and improve memory usage.

5. Remove unnecessary decrement of cnt[0]: In the counting sort algorithm, the counting array cnt is initialized with cnt[0] = -1. This is done to handle the case when the input vector contains the value 0. However, since cnt[0] is not used in the rest of the algorithm, we can remove this initialization.

6. Use const reference in loop: In the counting sort algorithm, the for-each loop iterates over the input vector by value. We can change this to iterate by const reference to avoid unnecessary copying.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

#define rep(i, a, b) for (int i = (a); i < (b); i++)

void counting_sort(vector<int>& v) {
  int n = v.size();
  int k = 0;
  for (int x : v) {
    k = max(k, x);
  }
  vector<int> cnt(k + 1), tmp(v);
  for (int x : v) {
    cnt[x]++;
  }
  for (int i = 1; i <= k; i++) {
    cnt[i] += cnt[i - 1];
  }
  for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
    v[cnt[tmp[i]] - 1] = tmp[i];
    cnt[tmp[i]]--;
  }
}

int main() {
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  vector<int> A;
  A.reserve(n);
  rep(i, 0, n) {
    int x;
    cin >> x;
    A.push_back(x);
  }
  counting_sort(A);
  cout << A[0];
  rep(i, 1, A.size()) {
    cout << " " << A[i];
  }
  cout << endl;
  return 0;
}
```

These optimizations should improve the running time and memory usage of the program.
