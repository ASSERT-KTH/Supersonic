The given program is implementing the counting sort algorithm to sort an array of integers. 

Here are the steps to optimize the program:

Step 1: Remove unnecessary includes and macros.
- The program includes the header file "bits/stdc++.h", which is not necessary. We can remove it.
- The macros "dump" and "rep" are not used in the program. We can remove them as well.

Step 2: Replace unnecessary vector copy.
- In the counting_sort function, the vector "tmp" is created as a copy of the input vector "v". However, there is no need to create this copy. We can directly use "v" instead of "tmp".

Step 3: Optimize counting array initialization.
- The counting_sort function initializes the counting array "cnt" with size k+1 and sets all elements to zero. However, we can optimize this initialization by using the vector constructor to initialize "cnt" with all elements set to zero.

Step 4: Optimize counting array update.
- In the counting_sort function, the counting array "cnt" is updated by iterating over the input vector "v" and incrementing the corresponding count for each element. However, we can optimize this update step by using a range-based for loop instead of a traditional for loop.

Step 5: Remove unnecessary decrement of count[0].
- In the counting_sort function, the first element of the counting array "cnt" is decremented by 1. However, this decrement is unnecessary and can be removed.

Step 6: Modify the main function.
- In the main function, we can remove the unnecessary call to A.size() in the second loop. We already know the size of the vector "A" from the variable n.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

void counting_sort(std::vector<int>& v) {
  int n = v.size();
  int k = *std::max_element(v.begin(), v.end());

  std::vector<int> cnt(k + 1, 0);

  for (int x : v)
    cnt[x]++;

  for (int i = 1; i <= k; i++)
    cnt[i] += cnt[i - 1];

  std::vector<int> sorted(n);
  for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
    sorted[cnt[v[i]] - 1] = v[i];
    cnt[v[i]]--;
  }

  v = sorted;
}

int main() {
  int n;
  std::cin >> n;

  std::vector<int> A(n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    std::cin >> A[i];
  }

  counting_sort(A);

  std::cout << A[0];
  for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
    std::cout << " " << A[i];
  }
  std::cout << std::endl;

  return 0;
}
```

The optimized program makes small modifications to the original one to improve running time and memory usage. It removes unnecessary includes and macros, optimizes the counting array initialization and update, and removes unnecessary vector copies and decrements.
