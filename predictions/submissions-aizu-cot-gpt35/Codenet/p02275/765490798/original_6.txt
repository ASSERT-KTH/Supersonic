The given program performs counting sort on a vector of integers. Counting sort is a linear time sorting algorithm that works efficiently when the range of input values is small.

To optimize the program, we can make a small modification to the counting_sort function. Currently, the function creates a temporary vector `tmp` and copies the input vector `v` into it. This is unnecessary and can be avoided.

Here's the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

void counting_sort(vector<int> &v) {
  int n = v.size(), k = *max_element(v.begin(), v.end()) + 1;
  vector<int> cnt(k), output(n);

  for (int x : v)
    cnt[x]++;
  for (int i = 1; i < k; i++)
    cnt[i] += cnt[i - 1];
  for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
    output[cnt[v[i]] - 1] = v[i];
    cnt[v[i]]--;
  }

  v = output;
}

int main() {
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  vector<int> A(n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> A[i];
  }
  counting_sort(A);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cout << A[i] << " ";
  }
  cout << endl;
  return 0;
}
```

In the optimized program, we remove the unnecessary `tmp` vector and replace it with an `output` vector. This `output` vector is used to store the sorted elements in the correct order. We also modify the `cnt` vector to have a size of `k`, where `k` is the maximum element of the input vector `v` plus 1. This ensures that all elements of `v` can be counted correctly.

Other changes in the program include removing unnecessary header files, replacing the `rep` and `rrep` macros with regular `for` loops, and removing the unnecessary `chmax` and `chmin` template functions. These changes do not have a significant impact on the performance of the program, but they improve readability.
