Step 1: Remove unnecessary includes and macros.
- The `bits/stdc++.h` include is not necessary and can be removed.
- The `dump` macro is not used and can be removed.

Step 2: Optimize the counting sort algorithm.
- Currently, the counting sort algorithm has a time complexity of O(n+k), where n is the number of elements and k is the maximum element in the array. To optimize this, we can use a variation of counting sort called radix sort, which has a time complexity of O(n*log(k)).
- In radix sort, we sort the elements by their digits from the least significant digit to the most significant digit. Each pass of the radix sort algorithm sorts the elements based on a specific digit. We repeat this process until all the digits have been processed.
- Since the input elements are integers, we can use base 10 for the digits. So, we can perform 10 passes of the radix sort algorithm.
- In each pass, we count the occurrences of each digit and calculate the prefix sum of the digit counts. We then rearrange the elements based on the current digit and update the prefix sum accordingly.
- The modified counting_sort function will perform the radix sort algorithm.

Step 3: Simplify the main function.
- We don't need to declare the variable `k` separately. We can calculate it directly inside the counting_sort function.
- We can use the range-based for loop instead of the index-based for loop to simplify the input reading and output writing.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

void counting_sort(vector<int>& v) {
    int n = v.size();
    int max_element = *max_element(v.begin(), v.end());

    for (int exp = 1; max_element / exp > 0; exp *= 10) {
        vector<int> count(10, 0);
        vector<int> output(n);

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
            count[(v[i] / exp) % 10]++;

        for (int i = 1; i < 10; i++)
            count[i] += count[i - 1];

        for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            output[count[(v[i] / exp) % 10] - 1] = v[i];
            count[(v[i] / exp) % 10]--;
        }

        v = output;
    }
}

int main() {
    int n;
    cin >> n;
    vector<int> A(n);

    for (int& num : A)
        cin >> num;

    counting_sort(A);
    
    cout << A[0];
    for (int i = 1; i < A.size(); i++)
        cout << " " << A[i];
    cout << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

The optimized program uses radix sort instead of counting sort for better time complexity. It also simplifies the main function by using the range-based for loop for input reading and output writing.
