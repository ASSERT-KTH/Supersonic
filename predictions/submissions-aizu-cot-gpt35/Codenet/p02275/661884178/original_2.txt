The given program reads an integer `n`, followed by `n` integers. It finds the minimum value among the `n` integers and counts the frequency of each integer. Then, it prints the minimum value followed by the sorted list of integers.

There are a few optimizations we can make to improve the runtime and memory usage of the program:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The program includes the entire `<bits/stdc++.h>` header, which is not necessary for this program. We can remove this line.

2. Replace the `r` macro with a regular `for` loop: The `r` macro is used to simplify the loop syntax. However, using a regular `for` loop can improve the readability of the code.

3. Replace the `s` macro with the `size` function: The `s` macro is used to get the size of a container. Instead of using a macro, we can use the `size` function to get the size of the container.

4. Use `cin` and `cout` instead of `scanf` and `printf`: The `scanf` and `printf` functions are slower than the `cin` and `cout` streams. By using `cin` and `cout`, we can improve the runtime of the program.

5. Use a fixed-size array instead of a dynamic array: The program uses a dynamic array `A` to count the frequency of each integer. However, since the maximum value of the integers is 10000, we can use a fixed-size array of size 10001 to store the frequency counts. This will save memory and improve runtime.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  
  int min = 2000000, t;
  vector<int> A(10001, 0);
  
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> t;
    if (t < min)
      min = t;
    A[t]++;
  }
  
  A[min]--;
  
  cout << min;
  for (int i = min; i < 10001; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j < A[i]; j++) {
      cout << ' ' << i;
    }
  }
  cout << endl;
  
  return 0;
}
```
