The given program is a simple implementation of counting sort. It takes an input array, counts the frequency of each element, and then prints the sorted array.

To optimize the program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The program includes the entire `<bits/stdc++.h>` library, which is not required. We can remove this line and include only the necessary headers.

2. Avoid using `using namespace std;`: Using the `using namespace std;` statement can lead to name clashes and is generally not recommended. We can use the `std::` prefix to specify the namespace explicitly.

3. Use `std::vector` instead of a fixed-sized array: Instead of using a fixed-sized array `A`, we can use a `std::vector` to dynamically allocate memory as required. This will make the program more flexible and avoid potential buffer overflows.

4. Use `std::cin` and `std::cout` instead of `scanf` and `printf`: Using `std::cin` and `std::cout` is generally safer and more efficient than `scanf` and `printf`. We can use the `>>` and `<<` operators to read and write input/output.

5. Avoid unnecessary macros: The macros `r` and `s` are used to simplify the `for` loop syntax and calculate the size of a container respectively. However, these macros are not necessary and can be replaced with regular loop syntax and the `size()` function.

With these optimizations in mind, the optimized program can be written as follows:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

int main() {
  int n;
  std::cin >> n;
  
  int min = 2000000, t;
  std::vector<int> A(10001, 0);
  
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    std::cin >> t;
    if (t < min) {
      min = t;
    }
    A[t]++;
  }
  
  A[min]--;
  std::cout << min;
  
  for (int i = min; i < 10001; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j < A[i]; j++) {
      std::cout << ' ' << i;
    }
  }
  
  std::cout << std::endl;
  return 0;
}
```

These modifications optimize the program for running time and memory usage while maintaining the same functionality.
