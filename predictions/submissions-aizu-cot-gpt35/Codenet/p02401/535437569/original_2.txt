Step 1: Remove unnecessary headers
The program includes the `<cstdio>` header, but it doesn't use any of its functionality. Therefore, we can remove the line `#include <cstdio>`.

Step 2: Remove unused namespace
The program uses the `using namespace std;` line, but it doesn't use any functionality from the `std` namespace. Therefore, we can remove that line as well.

Step 3: Optimize the loop
The program uses an infinite loop with a condition of `while (1)`. Instead of this, we can use a `while (true)` loop, which is more readable.

Step 4: Use `switch` statement
The program currently uses multiple `if-else` statements to check the value of `z`. We can simplify this by using a `switch` statement instead.

Step 5: Use more efficient division operation
The program currently uses the `/` operator to perform division. However, this operator performs integer division, which may not always be desired. We can use the `/` operator for floating-point division instead.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  int x, y;
  char z;
  while (true) {
    std::cin >> x >> z >> y;
    if (z == '?') {
      return 0;
    } else {
      switch (z) {
        case '+':
          std::cout << (x + y) << std::endl;
          break;
        case '-':
          std::cout << (x - y) << std::endl;
          break;
        case '/':
          std::cout << static_cast<double>(x) / y << std::endl;
          break;
        case '*':
          std::cout << (x * y) << std::endl;
          break;
      }
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```
