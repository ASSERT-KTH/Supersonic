Step 1: Remove unnecessary libraries
The program only uses the `cstdio` library for `printf` and `scanf`. We can remove the `using namespace std` line as it is not needed.

Step 2: Optimize input and output
Instead of using `scanf` and `printf`, we can use `cin` and `cout` which are faster for input and output operations.

Step 3: Optimize the loop
Currently, the program uses an infinite loop with a break condition inside. We can optimize this by using a `while` loop with a specific condition. This way, we avoid checking the condition for each iteration.

Step 4: Optimize the if-else statements
The if-else statements can be optimized by using a switch-case statement. This will make the code cleaner and potentially faster.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int x, y;
  char z;
  while (cin >> x >> z >> y) {
    if (z == '?') {
      break;
    }
    switch (z) {
      case '+':
        cout << (x + y) << endl;
        break;
      case '-':
        cout << (x - y) << endl;
        break;
      case '/':
        cout << (x / y) << endl;
        break;
      case '*':
        cout << (x * y) << endl;
        break;
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```
