The program reads two integers and a character from the user repeatedly until the character is '?'.

To optimize this program, we can make the following changes:

1. Instead of using `scanf` to read the input, we can use `cin` which is generally faster than `scanf` and has better error handling.

2. Instead of using `printf` to print the result, we can use `cout` which is generally faster than `printf`.

3. We can use a switch statement instead of multiple if-else statements to check the value of `z`. This can improve the readability and potentially the performance of the program.

Here's the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int x, y;
  char z;
  while (true) {
    cin >> x >> z >> y;
    if (z == '?') {
      break;
    }
    switch (z) {
      case '+':
        cout << x + y << endl;
        break;
      case '-':
        cout << x - y << endl;
        break;
      case '/':
        cout << x / y << endl;
        break;
      case '*':
        cout << x * y << endl;
        break;
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized program uses `cin` and `cout` for input and output respectively, and replaces the if-else statements with a switch statement for better readability and potentially better performance.
