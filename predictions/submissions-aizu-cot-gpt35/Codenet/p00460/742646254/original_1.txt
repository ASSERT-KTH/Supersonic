The given program calculates the number of sequences of length N^2, where each element is between 1 and M and the sum of the sequence is equal to S. The program uses dynamic programming to solve the problem.

To optimize the program, we can eliminate the unnecessary memset calls and remove the unnecessary modulo operation.

Here are the optimization steps:

1. Remove the unnecessary memset calls for the dp array. Since the array is already initialized to 0 at the beginning of each test case, we don't need to reset it again.

2. Remove the unnecessary modulo operation. Since we are only interested in the final answer modulo MOD, we can perform the modulo operation after calculating the answer, instead of performing it at each step of the dynamic programming loop.

3. Remove the unnecessary includes. The program includes the entire "bits/stdc++.h" library, which is not necessary. We can include only the necessary headers.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

typedef long long ll;

int dp[55][3030];

int main() {
  int const MOD = 100000;
  int N, M, S;
  while (cin >> N >> M >> S && (N | M | S)) {
    dp[0][0] = 1;
    for (int add = 1; add <= M; add++) {
      for (int currIndex = N * N; currIndex >= 1; currIndex--) {
        for (int currSum = add; currSum <= S; currSum++) {
          dp[currIndex][currSum] += dp[currIndex - 1][currSum - add];
        }
      }
    }
    cout << dp[N * N][S] % MOD << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized program eliminates the unnecessary memset calls and removes the unnecessary modulo operation. It should be more efficient in terms of both running time and memory usage.
