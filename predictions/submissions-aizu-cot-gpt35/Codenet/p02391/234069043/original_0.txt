Step 1: Remove unnecessary header files.
The `<algorithm>` and `<vector>` headers are not being used in the program. We can safely remove them.

Step 2: Remove unnecessary variable.
The variable `pai` is not being used in the program. We can remove it.

Step 3: Optimize input reading.
Instead of using `scanf` which is a slower input method, we can use `cin` for faster input reading.

Step 4: Optimize output writing.
Instead of using `printf` which is a slower output method, we can use `cout` for faster output writing.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main()
{
    int a, b;
    cin >> a >> b;

    if (a > b)
        cout << "a > b" << endl;
    else if (a < b)
        cout << "a < b" << endl;
    else
        cout << "a == b" << endl;

    return 0;
}
```
