Explanation of the optimization steps:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The program includes the `<algorithm>` and `<vector>` headers, but neither of these are used in the program. We can remove these includes to improve compilation time and reduce unnecessary dependencies.

2. Remove unnecessary precision for `pai`: The variable `pai` is declared as a `double`, but it only stores the value of pi up to a certain precision. We can change the type to `float` to save memory without affecting the functionality of the program.

3. Use `std::cin` and `std::cout` instead of `scanf` and `printf`: The program currently uses `scanf` and `printf` for input/output. While these functions are commonly used in C, they are slower and less type-safe compared to the C++ standard library's `std::cin` and `std::cout` functions. By using `std::cin` and `std::cout`, we can improve the program's performance and type safety.

Optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  float pai = 3.141592653589f;
  int a, b;
  std::cin >> a >> b;
  
  if (a > b)
    std::cout << "a > b" << std::endl;
  else if (a < b)
    std::cout << "a < b" << std::endl;
  else
    std::cout << "a == b" << std::endl;
  
  return 0;
}
```
