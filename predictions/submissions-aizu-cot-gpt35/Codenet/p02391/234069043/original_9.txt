The given program is a simple program that compares two integers `a` and `b` and prints whether `a` is greater than `b`, less than `b`, or equal to `b`. 

To optimize this program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary header files: The `<algorithm>` and `<bits/stdc++.h>` header files are not being used in the program, so we can remove them.

2. Remove unnecessary namespace: The `using namespace std;` statement is not necessary since we are not using any standard library functions without specifying the `std` namespace.

3. Replace `scanf` with `cin`: The `scanf` function can be slow and error-prone. We can use the `cin` object from the `iostream` library for input instead.

4. Replace `printf` with `cout`: Similarly, we can use the `cout` object from the `iostream` library for output instead of `printf`.

5. Avoid unnecessary calculations: The variable `pai` is declared but not used in the program. We can remove it to avoid unnecessary calculations.

After applying these optimizations, the optimized program will look like this:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  int a, b;
  std::cin >> a >> b;

  if (a > b)
    std::cout << "a > b\n";
  else if (a < b)
    std::cout << "a < b\n";
  else
    std::cout << "a == b\n";

  return 0;
}
```
