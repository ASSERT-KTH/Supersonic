Step 1: Remove unnecessary header files

The program includes unnecessary header files `<algorithm>` and `<vector>`. We can remove them to improve compilation time and reduce memory usage.

Step 2: Remove unused variable

The variable `pai` is declared but not used in the program. We can remove it to improve memory usage.

Step 3: Use `cout` instead of `printf`

Using `cout` from the `iostream` library is more idiomatic in C++ and can potentially improve performance.

Step 4: Remove `<bits/stdc++.h>`

The header `<bits/stdc++.h>` is not a standard C++ header and is not needed in this program. We can remove it.

Step 5: Use `std::greater` to compare integers

Instead of using `if-else` statements to compare `a` and `b`, we can use the `std::greater` function from the `<functional>` header to simplify the code.

Here is the optimized C++ program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <functional>

int main() {
  int a, b;
  std::cin >> a >> b;

  if (std::greater<int>()(a, b))
    std::cout << "a > b\n";
  else if (std::less<int>()(a, b))
    std::cout << "a < b\n";
  else
    std::cout << "a == b\n";

  return 0;
}
```
