Explanation of the optimization steps:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The program includes `<algorithm>` and `<bits/stdc++.h>` which are not used in the code. We can remove these includes to improve compile time.

2. Remove unused variable: The variable `pai` is declared but not used anywhere in the code. We can remove this variable declaration to improve memory usage.

3. Use `std::cin` and `std::cout` instead of `scanf` and `printf`: The program currently uses `scanf` and `printf` for input and output. However, `std::cin` and `std::cout` are more efficient and safer alternatives. We can replace the input and output statements with `std::cin` and `std::cout` to improve both running time and memory usage.

4. Avoid unnecessary `using namespace std;`: The program currently uses `using namespace std;` which brings all the names from the `std` namespace into the global namespace. This can lead to potential naming conflicts. It is better to avoid this and use the `std::` prefix when necessary.

Optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  int a, b;
  std::cin >> a >> b;
  
  if (a > b)
    std::cout << "a > b\n";
  else if (a < b)
    std::cout << "a < b\n";
  else
    std::cout << "a == b\n";
  
  return 0;
}
```
