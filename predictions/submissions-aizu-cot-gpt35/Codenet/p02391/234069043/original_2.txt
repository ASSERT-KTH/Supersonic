This program compares two integer values `a` and `b` and prints whether `a` is greater than, less than, or equal to `b`. 

To optimize this program, we can make the following modifications:
1. Remove unnecessary header files: The `bits/stdc++.h` header file includes a lot of other header files which may not be needed for this program. We can remove it.
2. Avoid including the entire `std` namespace: Instead of including the entire `std` namespace, we can just include the necessary headers and use the `std::` prefix for the required functions and objects.
3. Use `constexpr` for constant value: The value of `pai` is a constant, so we can use the `constexpr` keyword to declare it.
4. Use `std::cin` and `std::cout` instead of `scanf` and `printf`: The `std::cin` and `std::cout` functions are type-safe and more efficient compared to `scanf` and `printf`.
5. Use a ternary operator instead of multiple `if-else` statements: Instead of multiple `if-else` statements, we can use a ternary operator to simplify the code and improve readability.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    constexpr double pai = 3.141592653589;
    int a, b;
    std::cin >> a >> b;

    std::cout << (a > b ? "a > b" : (a < b ? "a < b" : "a == b")) << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```
