Step 1: Remove unnecessary includes

The program includes unnecessary headers such as `<algorithm>` and `<vector>`. Since these headers are not used in the program, they can be removed.

Step 2: Replace `bits/stdc++.h` with specific headers

The program includes `<bits/stdc++.h>` which is not a standard header and is not recommended to use. It is better to include specific headers that are required for the program. In this case, we only need `<cstdio>` for `scanf` and `printf` functions.

Step 3: Remove unnecessary variable `pai`

The variable `pai` is declared but not used in the program. It can be removed to improve memory usage.

Step 4: Optimize `printf` statements

The `printf` statements can be optimized by using a single `printf` statement with a format specifier instead of multiple `printf` statements. This reduces the overhead of calling multiple `printf` functions.

Step 5: Use the ternary operator

The `if-else` statement can be replaced with a ternary operator for a more concise code.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <cstdio>

int main() {
  int a, b;
  scanf("%d %d", &a, &b);
  printf("%s\n", (a > b) ? "a > b" : (a < b) ? "a < b" : "a == b");
  return 0;
}
```
