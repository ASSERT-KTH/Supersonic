To optimize the given C/C++ program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The program includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header, which includes all the standard library headers. This is not necessary and can be replaced with the specific headers required by the program.

2. Avoid using `using namespace std;`: Using the `using namespace std;` directive imports all the names from the `std` namespace into the global namespace. This can lead to naming conflicts and make the code less readable. Instead, we can use the `std::` prefix for the required names.

3. Remove unused macros: The program defines macros `REP`, `rep`, `IINF`, `EPS`, and `equals`, but they are not used in the code. We can remove these macros to simplify the code.

4. Optimize the `operator<<` overloads: The `operator<<` overloads for `Point3d` and `Segment3d` classes are defined, but they don't return any value. We should modify these overloads to return the `ostream&` object to enable chaining of multiple `<<` operators.

5. Modify `equals` function: The `equals` function is used to compare floating-point values for equality using a small epsilon value. However, this function is not efficient as it involves floating-point operations. We can modify the function to use a fixed epsilon value based on the required precision.

6. Modify `on_segment3d` function: The `on_segment3d` function currently checks if a point lies on a 3D segment by comparing distances using the `equals` function. This can be simplified by directly checking if the cross product of the vectors is zero. We can modify the function to use the cross product and avoid unnecessary calculations.

7. Modify `point_on_the_triangle3d` function: The `point_on_the_triangle3d` function checks if a point lies on a 3D triangle by checking if it lies on any of the triangle's segments. This can be optimized by calculating the barycentric coordinates of the point with respect to the triangle and checking if they are within the range [0, 1]. We can modify the function to use barycentric coordinates for the check.

8. Modify `rotateX`, `rorateY`, `rorateZ`, `rotateEuler`, and `rotateRollPitchYaw` functions: These functions are used to perform 3D rotations. However, they can be simplified by using matrix operations instead of individual trigonometric calculations. We can modify these functions to use matrix multiplication for the rotations.

9. Modify `Plane3d` class: The `Plane3d` class currently calculates the normal vector and distance from a given set of points. However, this can be simplified by using the cross product of two vectors. We can modify the class constructor to directly calculate the normal vector and distance.

10. Modify `intersectS` function: The `intersectS` function currently checks if a segment intersects a plane by comparing dot products. This can be simplified by directly checking if the dot products have different signs. We can modify the function to use this simplified check.

11. Modify `crosspointS` function: The `crosspointS` function currently calculates the cross point between a segment and a plane using dot products. This can be simplified by directly calculating the cross point using the segment's endpoints and the plane's normal vector. We can modify the function to use the simplified calculation.

12. Avoid unnecessary calculations in `crosspointTS` function: The `crosspointTS` function currently calculates the cross point between a segment and a triangle using the segment's endpoints and the triangle's normal vector. However, this involves unnecessary calculations. We can modify the function to directly use the segment's endpoints and the triangle's vertices to calculate the cross point.

With these optimizations in mind, here is the optimized C++ program:
