To optimize the given program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary header files: The program includes `<bits/stdc++.h>` which is a non-standard header file and includes many unnecessary header files. We can remove this line and include only the necessary header files.

2. Avoid using the `equals` function: The `equals` function is used to compare floating-point numbers for equality. However, floating-point comparisons can be tricky due to precision errors. Instead of using `equals`, we can use a small epsilon value for comparisons.

3. Avoid using the `fabs` function: The `fabs` function is used to compute the absolute value of a floating-point number. However, the `abs` function can be used to achieve the same result.

4. Avoid unnecessary calculations in the `point_on_the_triangle3d` function: The `point_on_the_triangle3d` function calculates cross products and dot products unnecessarily. We can simplify the function by checking if the point lies on any of the triangle edges before performing further calculations.

5. Avoid unnecessary calculations in the `rotateX`, `rorateY`, `rorateZ`, `rotateEuler`, and `rotateRollPitchYaw` functions: These functions perform complex calculations for rotation transformations. However, we can simplify the calculations by using trigonometric identities and simplifications.

6. Avoid unnecessary calculations in the `Plane3d` class: The `Plane3d` class performs unnecessary calculations in the constructor and the `set_d` function. We can simplify the calculations by using the `set_d` function to set the value of `d` directly.

7. Avoid unnecessary calculations in the `crosspointTS` function: The `crosspointTS` function performs unnecessary calculations for computing the intersection between a triangle and a segment. We can simplify the calculations by using the `intersectS` and `crosspointS` functions from the `Plane3d` class.

After making these optimizations, the optimized program is as follows:
