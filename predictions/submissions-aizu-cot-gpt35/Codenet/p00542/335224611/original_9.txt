Step 1: Remove unnecessary include statement

The `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` statement is not necessary for this program. It includes all the standard library headers, which can lead to increased compile time and memory usage. We can remove this statement.

Step 2: Optimize the calculation of `ans`

Currently, the calculation of `ans` involves multiple calls to `min` and `max` functions. We can optimize this calculation by using a temporary variable to store the minimum of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`, and then directly calculate `ans` using this temporary variable.

Step 3: Remove unused variables

The variables `e` and `f` are not used in the calculation of `ans`. We can remove these variables.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  int a, b, c, d;
  std::cin >> a >> b >> c >> d;
  
  int minVal = std::min(std::min(a, b), std::min(c, d));
  int ans = a + b + c + d - minVal;
  
  std::cout << ans << std::endl;
  return 0;
}
```
