The given program calculates the sum of a, b, c, and d after subtracting the minimum of a, b, c, and d, and then adds the maximum of e and f to the sum. The program can be optimized as follows:

1. Remove the unnecessary inclusion of the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header file. This header file includes a large number of other header files, which can slow down the compilation process and increase memory usage.

2. Instead of using `using namespace std;`, explicitly prefix the standard library functions and objects with `std::` to avoid potential naming conflicts.

3. Remove the unnecessary variables `c` and `f` since they are not used in the calculation.

4. Instead of reading the input values in separate lines, read them in a single line using `std::cin`.

5. Use a single `std::min` call to find the minimum of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` instead of nested `std::min` calls.

6. Use a single `std::max` call to find the maximum of `e` and `f` instead of separate comparisons.

7. Print the result directly using `std::cout` instead of assigning it to a variable and then printing.

With these optimizations, the program becomes:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  int a, b, d, e;
  std::cin >> a >> b >> d >> e;
  
  int ans = a + b + d - std::min({a, b, d}) + std::max(e, d);
  std::cout << ans << std::endl;
  
  return 0;
}
```
