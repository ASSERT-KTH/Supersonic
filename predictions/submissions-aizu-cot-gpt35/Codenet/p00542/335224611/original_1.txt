Step 1: Remove unnecessary header file
The `<bits/stdc++.h>` header file is not necessary for this program. It includes a lot of standard library headers, which can increase compilation time. We can remove this header and include only the necessary headers.

Step 2: Optimize input/output operations
The current program uses `cin` and `cout` for input and output operations respectively. These operations can be slow for large inputs or outputs. We can optimize this by using a faster input/output method.

Step 3: Simplify the calculation
The calculation of `ans` can be simplified to improve readability.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int a, b, c, d, e, f;
  scanf("%d%d%d%d%d%d", &a, &b, &c, &d, &e, &f);
  
  int min_abcd = min(min(a, b), min(c, d));
  int ans = a + b + c + d - min_abcd + max(e, f);
  
  printf("%d\n", ans);
  return 0;
}
```
