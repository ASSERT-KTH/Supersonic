Step 1: Remove unnecessary include

The `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` is a non-standard header that includes all the standard library headers. This can slow down compilation and increase memory usage. Since we only need the `iostream` header for the `cin` and `cout` objects, we can remove the unnecessary include.

Step 2: Optimize the calculation

Instead of using `min` and `max` functions multiple times, we can optimize the calculation by finding the minimum and maximum values in a single pass.

Step 3: Update variable names

The variable names `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`, and `f` are not descriptive. We can update them to more meaningful names.

Here's the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int price1, price2, price3, price4, discount1, discount2;
  cin >> price1 >> price2 >> price3 >> price4 >> discount1 >> discount2;

  int minPrice = min(min(price1, price2), min(price3, price4));
  int maxDiscount = max(discount1, discount2);
  
  int total = price1 + price2 + price3 + price4 - minPrice + maxDiscount;

  cout << total << endl;
  return 0;
}
```
