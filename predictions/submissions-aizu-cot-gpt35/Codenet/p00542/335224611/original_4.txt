Optimization steps:

1. Remove the unnecessary include statement `<bits/stdc++.h>`. This header includes all the standard library headers, which can increase compilation time and memory usage. Instead, only include the necessary headers `iostream` and `algorithm`.

2. Remove the `using namespace std;` statement. This avoids polluting the global namespace and improves code readability.

3. Instead of using multiple `cin` statements to read input, use a single `cin` statement with the input variables separated by spaces. This reduces the number of function calls and improves input reading efficiency.

4. Avoid using the `min` and `max` functions multiple times. Instead, calculate the minimum and maximum values once and store them in variables. This reduces the number of function calls and improves runtime efficiency.

5. Modify the calculation of `ans` to remove unnecessary calculations. Instead of calculating the minimum of `a, b, c, d` twice, calculate it once and store it in a variable.

6. Modify the calculation of `ans` to use subtraction instead of addition. Instead of adding `a, b, c, d` and then subtracting the minimum, subtract the minimum from the sum of `a, b, c, d`. This reduces the number of operations and improves runtime efficiency.

7. Modify the calculation of `ans` to use the stored minimum value instead of calling the `min` function multiple times. This further reduces the number of function calls and improves runtime efficiency.

8. Modify the calculation of `ans` to use the stored maximum value instead of calling the `max` function. This reduces the number of function calls and improves runtime efficiency.

Optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>

int main() {
    int a, b, c, d, e, f;
    std::cin >> a >> b >> c >> d >> e >> f;

    int minValue = std::min(std::min(a, b), std::min(c, d));
    int maxValue = std::max(e, f);

    int ans = a + b + c + d - minValue + maxValue;
    std::cout << ans << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```
