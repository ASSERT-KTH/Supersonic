The given program calculates the sum of five variables a, b, c, d, and the maximum value between e and f. It then subtracts the minimum value between a, b, c, and d from the sum. The result is then printed.

To optimize this program, we can eliminate the unnecessary use of the `bits/stdc++.h` header, as it includes several standard C++ libraries, which may not be required for this specific program. We can include only the necessary headers, such as `<iostream>` for input/output operations.

Additionally, we can simplify the calculation of the minimum value and the maximum value by using the ternary operator instead of the `min()` and `max()` functions.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  int a, b, c, d, e, f;
  std::cin >> a >> b >> c >> d >> e >> f;
  
  int min_val = (a < b) ? ((a < c) ? ((a < d) ? a : d) : ((c < d) ? c : d)) : ((b < c) ? ((b < d) ? b : d) : ((c < d) ? c : d));
  int max_val = (e > f) ? e : f;
  
  int ans = a + b + c + d - min_val + max_val;
  
  std::cout << ans << std::endl;
  return 0;
}
```

By using the ternary operator, we eliminate the need for multiple function calls, reducing both the running time and memory usage.
