Step 1: Remove unnecessary headers.

The `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` header includes a lot of unnecessary headers, which can slow down the compilation process and increase memory usage. We can replace it with the specific headers that are actually needed.

```
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>
```

Step 2: Optimize the input process.

Currently, the program uses `cin` to read the input values. However, `cin` is slower compared to other input methods like `scanf` or `getline`. We can use `scanf` to read the input values more efficiently.

```
int a, b, c, d, e, f;
scanf("%d %d %d %d %d %d", &a, &b, &c, &d, &e, &f);
```

Step 3: Optimize the calculation.

The calculation of `ans` can be optimized by removing unnecessary function calls and using more efficient operations.

```
int ans = a + b + c + d - min(min(a, b), min(c, d)) + max(e, f);
```

Step 4: Optimize the output process.

Currently, the program uses `cout` to print the result. However, `cout` is slower compared to other output methods like `printf`. We can use `printf` to output the result more efficiently.

```
printf("%d\n", ans);
```

Optimized program:

```
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int a, b, c, d, e, f;
  scanf("%d %d %d %d %d %d", &a, &b, &c, &d, &e, &f);
  int ans = a + b + c + d - min(min(a, b), min(c, d)) + max(e, f);
  printf("%d\n", ans);
  return 0;
}
```
