Optimization steps:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The `<algorithm>` header is not needed because the `std::sort()` function is the only function used from it. We can remove it.

2. Minimize vector resizing: In each iteration of the loop, the `std::vector` `vegetables` is resized to accommodate the new element. This can be optimized by reserving the required size upfront using the `std::vector::reserve()` function.

3. Remove unnecessary variable initialization: The variable `i` is initialized twice, once before the loop and then inside the loop. We can remove the first initialization since it is unnecessary.

4. Optimize loop condition: The loop condition `i < num` is checked at each iteration. However, we know that `i` will always be less than `num` because the loop is iterating over the range `[0, num)`. We can remove this check and use a more efficient loop construct.

5. Optimize sum calculation: Instead of using `std::vector::at()` to access the elements of `vegetables`, we can use the more efficient operator `[]` since we know that the index is always within bounds.

Optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

int main() {
  int num, cap, price;
  while (std::cin >> num >> cap) {
    if (num == 0 && cap == 0) {
      break;
    }
    std::vector<int> vegetables;
    vegetables.reserve(num);
    for (int i = 0; i < num; ++i) {
      std::cin >> price;
      vegetables.push_back(price);
    }
    std::sort(vegetables.begin(), vegetables.end(), std::greater<int>());
    int sum = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < num; ++i) {
      if ((i + 1) % cap != 0) {
        sum += vegetables[i];
      }
    }
    std::cout << sum << std::endl;
  }
}
```
