Step 1: Avoid unnecessary vector resizing
Currently, the program uses the `push_back` function to add elements to the `vegetables` vector. This function may trigger a vector resize operation, which can be expensive in terms of time and memory. To optimize this, we can preallocate the vector with the maximum size it will need, which is `num`:

```cpp
std::vector<int> vegetables(num);
```

Step 2: Avoid unnecessary modulo operation
The program currently uses the modulo operator `%` to check if `(i + 1)` is not divisible by `cap`. However, we can simplify this logic by directly checking if `i` is divisible by `cap`:

```cpp
if (i % cap != cap - 1) {
  sum += vegetables[i];
}
```

Step 3: Avoid unnecessary variable assignment
The program unnecessarily assigns the value `0` to the variable `i` before the `while` loop. We can remove this assignment since `i` is already initialized in the `for` loop:

```cpp
int i = 0;
```

Step 4: Remove unnecessary include directives
The program includes the `<algorithm>` header, but it doesn't use any functions from that header. We can remove this unnecessary include directive.

Step 5: Optimize the sorting operation
The program currently uses the `sort` function from the `<algorithm>` header to sort the `vegetables` vector. However, by using a partial sort instead of a full sort, we can improve the overall performance. Since we only need the top `cap` elements in descending order, we can use the `partial_sort` function instead:

```cpp
std::partial_sort(vegetables.begin(), vegetables.begin() + cap, vegetables.end(), std::greater<int>());
```

Optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <functional>

int main() {
  int num, cap, price, i;
  while (std::cin >> num >> cap) {
    if (num == 0 && cap == 0) {
      break;
    }
    std::vector<int> vegetables(num);

    for (i = 0; i < num; ++i) {
      std::cin >> price;
      vegetables[i] = price;
    }
    std::partial_sort(vegetables.begin(), vegetables.begin() + cap, vegetables.end(), std::greater<int>());

    int sum = 0;
    i = 0;
    while (i < num) {
      if (i % cap != cap - 1) {
        sum += vegetables[i];
      }
      ++i;
    }
    std::cout << sum << std::endl;
  }
}
```
