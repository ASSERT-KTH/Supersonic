Step 1: Remove unnecessary includes

The program includes the `<iostream>` and `<algorithm>` headers, but it doesn't actually use any of the functions from these headers. Therefore, we can remove these unnecessary includes to improve compilation time.

Step 2: Optimize the loop

The current loop iterates through all the vegetables and checks if `(i + 1) % cap != 0`. However, this check can be simplified by using a temporary variable. We can keep track of the remaining vegetables to be added to the sum by subtracting `cap - 1` from the total number of vegetables, and then we can add the corresponding vegetables to the sum.

Step 3: Remove unnecessary variables

The variables `num` and `i` are used to keep track of the number of vegetables and the iterator, respectively. However, these variables are not necessary. We can directly use the `vegetables.size()` function to get the number of vegetables, and we can use a range-based for loop to iterate over the vegetables.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

int main() {
  int cap, price;
  while (std::cin >> cap) {
    if (cap == 0) {
      break;
    }
    std::vector<int> vegetables;
    while (cap--) {
      std::cin >> price;
      vegetables.push_back(price);
    }
    std::sort(vegetables.begin(), vegetables.end(), std::greater<int>());
    int sum = 0;
    int remaining = vegetables.size() - 1;
    for (int i = 0; i < vegetables.size(); ++i) {
      if (remaining) {
        sum += vegetables[i];
        --remaining;
      }
    }
    std::cout << sum << std::endl;
  }
}
```
