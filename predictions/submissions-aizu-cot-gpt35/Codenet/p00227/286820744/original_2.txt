Step 1: Avoid unnecessary memory reallocations

In the original program, a vector `vegetables` is created and resized to accommodate `num` elements for each iteration of the while loop. This can result in unnecessary memory reallocations and slow down the program. 

To optimize this, we can preallocate the vector `vegetables` with the maximum possible size upfront, which is the maximum value of `num`. By doing this, we can avoid multiple reallocations and improve the memory usage.

Step 2: Avoid using `std::greater` for sorting

The original program sorts the `vegetables` vector in descending order using `std::greater`. However, this can be optimized by using `std::sort` in ascending order and then reversing the sorted vector. This eliminates the need for the `std::greater` function object and improves the sorting performance.

Step 3: Simplify the loop condition

The loop condition `i < num` is checked twice in the original program, both in the for loop and the while loop. We can simplify the loop condition by using a single loop with the condition `i < cap * (num / cap)`.

Step 4: Move the variable declarations closer to their usage

In the original program, the variables `num`, `cap`, `price`, and `i` are declared at the beginning of the main function, even though they are only used within the while loop. We can improve the code readability by moving these variable declarations closer to their usage within the loop.

Step 5: Avoid unnecessary sum calculation

The original program calculates the sum of vegetable prices by adding each price to the `sum` variable, but skips adding the price when `(i + 1) % cap == 0`. We can simplify this logic by calculating the sum only for the elements that should be included, which are the first `num % cap` elements.

Optimized program:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

int main() {
  int num, cap;
  while (std::cin >> num >> cap) {
    if (num == 0 && cap == 0) {
      break;
    }

    std::vector<int> vegetables(num);
    for (int i = 0; i < num; ++i) {
      std::cin >> vegetables[i];
    }

    std::sort(vegetables.begin(), vegetables.end());
    std::reverse(vegetables.begin(), vegetables.end());

    int sum = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < cap * (num / cap); ++i) {
      if (i % cap != cap - 1) {
        sum += vegetables[i];
      }
    }

    std::cout << sum << std::endl;
  }
}
```

Explanation:

1. The vector `vegetables` is preallocated with size `num` to avoid unnecessary reallocations.
2. The `std::greater` function object is replaced with `std::sort` in ascending order followed by `std::reverse` to sort the `vegetables` vector in descending order.
3. The loop condition is simplified to `i < cap * (num / cap)` to iterate only over the required elements.
4. The variable declarations are moved closer to their usage within the loop for improved code readability.
5. The sum calculation is simplified to include only the required elements.
