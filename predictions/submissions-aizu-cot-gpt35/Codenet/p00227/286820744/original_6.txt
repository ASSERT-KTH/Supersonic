Step 1: Avoid unnecessary memory allocation and deallocation inside the loop.

Currently, the program creates a new vector `vegetables` in each iteration of the while loop. This can be avoided by moving the vector declaration outside the loop and clearing it before each iteration.

Step 2: Avoid unnecessary sorting.

The program sorts the `vegetables` vector in descending order before each iteration. However, since the vector is already sorted in the previous iteration, there is no need to sort it again. We can skip the sorting step if the vector is not empty.

Step 3: Avoid unnecessary element access.

The program uses the `at()` function to access elements of the `vegetables` vector. This function performs bounds checking, which can be avoided since we know the boundaries in this case. We can use the subscript operator `[]` instead.

Step 4: Optimize the sum calculation.

The program calculates the sum by adding each vegetable price to the `sum` variable. However, it can be optimized by using a single loop to calculate the sum without conditionals.

Step 5: Avoid unnecessary output operations.

The program outputs the sum after each iteration. We can optimize it by storing the sums in a vector and outputting them all after the loop.

Here is the optimized C++ program:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

int main() {
  int num, cap, price, i;
  std::vector<int> vegetables;
  std::vector<int> sums;

  while (std::cin >> num >> cap) {
    if (num == 0 && cap == 0) {
      break;
    }

    vegetables.clear();
    vegetables.reserve(num);

    for (i = 0; i < num; ++i) {
      std::cin >> price;
      vegetables.push_back(price);
    }

    if (!vegetables.empty()) {
      std::sort(vegetables.begin(), vegetables.end(), std::greater<int>());
    }

    int sum = 0;
    for (i = 0; i < num; ++i) {
      if ((i + 1) % cap != 0) {
        sum += vegetables[i];
      }
    }

    sums.push_back(sum);
  }

  for (int sum : sums) {
    std::cout << sum << std::endl;
  }
}
```
