The given program is an expression evaluator that computes the maximum value of an arithmetic expression.

To optimize the program for running time and memory usage, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The program includes the entire `<bits/stdc++.h>` header, which is not necessary. We can remove this line and only include the necessary headers.

2. Avoid global variables: The variable `S` and `ch` are declared globally. It is better to declare them locally in the `main` function and pass them as parameters to the functions that require them.

3. Avoid repeated calculations: The program currently calculates the same expression multiple times in the innermost loop. We can optimize this by calculating the expression once and storing the result in a variable.

4. Use precomputed values for character indices: The program currently uses `ch[S[p]]` to determine the precedence of an operator. Instead of calculating this every time, we can precompute the indices for each operator and store them in an array.

5. Minimize unnecessary function calls: The `get` function is called multiple times for the same operator. We can optimize this by calculating the result directly in the `calc` function.

Here is the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

typedef long long ll;

ll getNum(const string& S, int& p) {
  ll res = 0;
  while (isdigit(S[p]))
    res = res * 10 + S[p++] - '0';
  return res;
}

ll calc(const string& S, const int* ch, int& p) {
  ll res, t;
  if (S[p] == '(')
    p++, res = calc(S, ch, p), p++;
  else
    res = getNum(S, p);
  
  while (p < S.size() && S[p] != ')' && ch[S[p]] > ch[-100]) {
    t = S[p++];
    if (t == '+')
      res += calc(S, ch, p);
    else if (t == '-')
      res -= calc(S, ch, p);
    else if (t == '*')
      res *= calc(S, ch, p);
  }
  
  return res;
}

ll bnf(const string& S, const int* ch) {
  int p = 0;
  ll res = calc(S, ch, p);
  
  while (p < S.size() && S[p] != ')') {
    int t = S[p++];
    if (t == '+')
      res += calc(S, ch, p);
    else if (t == '-')
      res -= calc(S, ch, p);
    else if (t == '*')
      res *= calc(S, ch, p);
  }
  
  return res;
}

int main() {
  string S;
  cin >> S;
  
  ll res = bnf(S, ch);
  
  int ch[1 << 8];
  for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++)
    for (int j = 0; j < 3; j++)
      for (int k = 0; k < 3; k++) {
        ch['+'] = i, ch['-'] = j, ch['*'] = k;
        res = max(res, bnf(S, ch));
      }
  
  cout << res << endl;
  
  return 0;
}
```

In this optimized version, we have removed unnecessary includes, avoided global variables, minimized function calls, and used precomputed values for character indices. These optimizations will improve the running time and memory usage of the program.
