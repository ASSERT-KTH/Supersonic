The given program solves a maze problem using a recursive function `saiki`. The program initializes a 2D array `mp` to represent the maze, and another 2D array `dp` to keep track of the number of ways to reach each cell in the maze.

Here are the steps to optimize the program:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The program includes `<bits/stdc++.h>` which is not required. We can remove this line.

2. Remove unnecessary semicolon: There is an extra semicolon after the declaration of `dp` array. We can remove it.

3. Optimize the `saiki` function: The `saiki` function is currently implemented recursively. We can optimize it by using an iterative approach. Instead of recursively calling `saiki`, we can use a while loop to move through the maze until we reach the boundary. This will eliminate the function call overhead.

4. Optimize the `memset` function: The program uses `memset` to initialize the `dp` array to zero. However, `memset` is not the most efficient way to initialize an array in C++. We can use `std::fill` to initialize the array instead.

5. Optimize the calculation of `dp` array: The calculation of the `dp` array can be optimized by removing unnecessary divisions and modulo operations. Instead of dividing and modulo by 2, we can use bitwise operations to achieve the same results. This will reduce the number of arithmetic operations and improve performance.

6. Avoid unnecessary assignments: The program assigns `!mp[i][j]` to `dp[i + 1][j]` when `dp[i][j]` is odd. However, this assignment is not necessary because the value of `dp[i + 1][j]` is already zero-initialized and will not be used in further calculations. We can remove this assignment.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int mp[1001][1001];
int dp[1001][1001];

void saiki(int x, int y) {
  int dx[] = {0, 1};
  int dy[] = {1, 0};
  
  while (y != h && x != w) {
    x += dx[mp[y][x]];
    y += dy[mp[y][x]];
  }

  cout << y + 1 << " " << x + 1 << endl;
}

int main() {
  int h, w, n;
  
  while (true) {
    cin >> h >> w >> n;
    if (h == 0 && w == 0 && n == 0)
      break;

    for (int i = 0; i < h; i++) {
      for (int j = 0; j < w; j++) {
        cin >> mp[i][j];
      }
    }

    fill(&dp[0][0], &dp[0][0] + sizeof(dp) / sizeof(int), 0);
    dp[0][0] = n - 1;

    for (int i = 0; i < h; i++) {
      for (int j = 0; j < w; j++) {
        dp[i][j + 1] += dp[i][j] >> 1 + mp[i][j] * (dp[i][j] & 1);
        dp[i + 1][j] += dp[i][j] >> 1 + (!mp[i][j] * (dp[i][j] & 1));

        if (dp[i][j] & 1) {
          mp[i][j] = !mp[i][j];
        }
      }
    }

    saiki(0, 0);
  }

  return 0;
}
```

In the optimized program, we have made the following changes:

- Removed unnecessary includes.
- Removed unnecessary semicolon.
- Optimized the `saiki` function to use an iterative approach.
- Replaced `memset` with `std::fill` to initialize the `dp` array.
- Optimized the calculation of `dp` array using bitwise operations.
- Removed unnecessary assignment in the calculation of `dp` array.
