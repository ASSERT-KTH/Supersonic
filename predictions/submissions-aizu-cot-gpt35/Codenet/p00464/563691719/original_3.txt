The given program seems to be solving some kind of maze problem. 

To optimize the program, we can make the following changes:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The program includes the entire `<bits/stdc++.h>` library, which is not necessary. We can remove it and include only the necessary headers.

2. Avoid using `std::endl`: The program uses `std::endl` to output a newline character and flush the buffer. However, flushing the buffer after each output can significantly slow down the program. Instead, we can use `'\n'` to output a newline character, which is faster.

3. Remove unused variables: The program has an extra semicolon after the declaration of `dp[1001][1001]`. We can remove it.

4. Avoid unnecessary recursion: The `saiki` function uses recursion to traverse the maze. However, recursion can be slow and consume a lot of memory. We can replace the recursive implementation with a loop-based approach.

5. Avoid unnecessary modulo operations: The program uses `%` operator to check if a number is odd. However, we can use bitwise `&` operator to check the least significant bit of a number, which is faster.

Here is the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cstring>
using namespace std;

const int MAXN = 1001;

int mp[MAXN][MAXN], dp[MAXN][MAXN];
int h, w, n;

void traverseMaze() {
    int dx[] = {0, 1}, dy[] = {1, 0};
    int x = 0, y = 0;

    while (y != h && x != w) {
        int nx = x + dx[mp[y][x]];
        int ny = y + dy[mp[y][x]];
        x = nx;
        y = ny;
    }

    cout << y + 1 << " " << x + 1 << '\n';
}

int main() {
    ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(nullptr);

    while (1) {
        cin >> h >> w >> n;
        if (!h && !w && !n)
            break;

        for (int i = 0; i < h; i++)
            for (int j = 0; j < w; j++)
                cin >> mp[i][j];

        memset(dp, 0, sizeof(dp));
        dp[0][0] = n - 1;

        for (int i = 0; i < h; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < w; j++) {
                dp[i][j + 1] += dp[i][j] / 2 + mp[i][j] * (dp[i][j] & 1);
                dp[i + 1][j] += dp[i][j] / 2 + (!mp[i][j]) * (dp[i][j] & 1);
                mp[i][j] ^= (dp[i][j] & 1);
            }
        }

        traverseMaze();
    }

    return 0;
}
```

This optimized version of the program makes the following changes:

1. Replaces the unnecessary includes with the necessary ones.
2. Uses `'\n'` instead of `std::endl`.
3. Removes the extra semicolon after the declaration of `dp[1001][1001]`.
4. Replaces recursion with a loop-based approach in the `traverseMaze` function.
5. Uses bitwise `&` operator to check the least significant bit of a number instead of using the modulo operator `%`.
