Step 1: Eliminate unnecessary includes
- The program includes `<bits/stdc++.h>` which includes all the standard library headers. This is not necessary for the given program and can be removed.

Step 2: Avoid using `using namespace std`
- The program uses `using namespace std` which brings all the names from the `std` namespace into the global namespace. This can lead to naming conflicts and is generally considered bad practice. It's better to use the `std::` prefix for standard library names.

Step 3: Improve variable naming
- The variable names `h`, `w`, and `n` are not descriptive. It's better to use more meaningful names to improve code readability.

Step 4: Optimize the `saiki` function
- The `saiki` function is called recursively and prints the coordinates of each step. This can be optimized by using a loop instead of recursion. We can change the function to return a vector of coordinates instead of printing them directly.

Step 5: Optimize the calculation of `dp`
- The calculation of `dp` can be optimized by avoiding unnecessary divisions and modulo operations. We can calculate the divisions and modulos only once and store them in variables.

Step 6: Optimize the memory usage
- The matrix `mp` is declared with a fixed size of 1001x1001, which may be excessive for the given problem constraints. We can reduce the size of `mp` to the actual input size.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <cstring>

int main() {
  int height, width, num;
  
  while (true) {
    std::cin >> height >> width >> num;
    if (height == 0 && width == 0 && num == 0)
      break;

    std::vector<std::vector<int>> mp(height, std::vector<int>(width));
    std::vector<std::vector<int>> dp(height, std::vector<int>(width, 0));

    for (int i = 0; i < height; i++)
      for (int j = 0; j < width; j++)
        std::cin >> mp[i][j];

    dp[0][0] = num - 1;
    for (int i = 0; i < height; i++) {
      for (int j = 0; j < width; j++) {
        int div = dp[i][j] / 2;
        int mod = dp[i][j] % 2;

        dp[i][j + 1] += div + mp[i][j] * mod;
        dp[i + 1][j] += div + !mp[i][j] * mod;

        if (mod)
          mp[i][j] = !mp[i][j];
      }
    }

    std::vector<std::pair<int, int>> path;
    int x = 0, y = 0;
    while (y != height && x != width) {
      path.push_back({y + 1, x + 1});
      int dx[] = {0, 1};
      int dy[] = {1, 0};
      x += dx[mp[y][x]];
      y += dy[mp[y][x]];
    }

    for (const auto& coord : path)
      std::cout << coord.second << " " << coord.first << std::endl;
  }

  return 0;
}
```
