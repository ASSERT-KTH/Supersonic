Step 1: Remove unnecessary includes and macros

The program includes the entire `<bits/stdc++.h>` library, which is not necessary. We can remove it and only include the necessary headers. Additionally, the macros `INF`, `f`, `s`, and `N` are defined but not used. We can remove them as well.

Step 2: Optimize input and output

The program uses `cin` and `cout` for input and output. These operations are slower compared to using C-style input/output functions `scanf` and `printf`. We can modify the program to use `scanf` and `printf` for faster input and output.

Step 3: Optimize vector initialization

The program initializes `vector<P> mg[2]` using `mg[2]`. This initializes two vectors, even though only one vector will be used. We can modify the program to only initialize one vector `vector<P> mg`.

Step 4: Optimize loop conditions and variables

The program uses a loop condition `for (int i = 0; i < 2; i++)` and `for (int j = 1; j < N + 10; j++)`, which can be simplified by using constant values instead of variables. Additionally, the loop variable `k` is not necessary and can be removed.

Step 5: Optimize loop bounds

The program uses a loop bound `j <= (N / mg[k][i].f + 1) * mg[k][i].f` which can be simplified by removing the multiplication and division operations. We can modify the loop bound to `j <= N + mg[k][i].f` for better performance.

Step 6: Optimize nested loops

The program uses nested loops to calculate the minimum cost. We can optimize the nested loops by removing unnecessary calculations and variables.

Step 7: Optimize memory usage

The program uses a 2D array `dp[2][N + 10]` which has a large size. We can reduce the memory usage by using a 1D array `dp[N + 10]`.

Based on these optimizations, here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

typedef pair<int, int> P;
typedef long long ll;

const int N = 100000;

int main() {
  int n, m, hp[101];
  while (scanf("%d", &n), n) {
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
      scanf("%d", &hp[i]);
    
    vector<P> mg;
    scanf("%d", &m);
    for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
      char name[101], type[101];
      int cost, dam;
      scanf("%s %d %s %d", name, &cost, type, &dam);
      if (dam)
        mg.push_back(P(dam, cost));
    }
    
    int dp[N + 10] = {};
    for (int j = 1; j < N + 10; j++)
      dp[j] = INF;
    
    for (int i = 0; i < mg.size(); i++) {
      for (int j = mg[i].f; j <= N + mg[i].f; j++) {
        dp[min(N, j)] = min(dp[min(N, j)], dp[j - mg[i].f] + mg[i].s);
      }
    }
    
    for (int j = N; j >= 0; j--)
      dp[j] = min(dp[j], dp[j + 1]);
    
    ll ans = INF;
    for (int i = 0; i <= N; i++) {
      ll cost = dp[i];
      for (int j = 0; j < n; j++)
        cost += dp[max(0, hp[j] - i)];
      ans = min(ans, cost);
    }
    
    printf("%lld\n", ans);
  }
  return 0;
}
```
