The given program calculates the minimum cost required to defeat a group of monsters in a game. The program uses dynamic programming to solve the problem.

To optimize the program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary header inclusion: The program includes the `bits/stdc++.h` header, which includes a large number of standard library headers. This can result in increased compilation time and unnecessary memory usage. We can remove this line and include only the necessary headers.

2. Use a constant value for `N`: The program defines `N` as 100000, which is the maximum possible value for some arrays. However, the actual size of these arrays is determined by the input, which can be much smaller. We can remove the constant definition and use a dynamic size based on the input.

3. Use `vector` instead of fixed-size arrays: The program uses fixed-size arrays `hp` and `dp`. However, the size of these arrays is determined by the input, which can vary. We can use `vector` instead to dynamically allocate memory based on the input.

4. Use `reserve` for `vector` capacity: The program uses `vector<P> mg[2]` to store pairs of integers. We can use the `reserve` function to preallocate memory for `mg[0]` and `mg[1]` based on the input size. This can improve the performance by reducing the number of reallocations and memory copies.

5. Optimize the innermost loop: The innermost loop in the program has a condition `j <= (N / mg[k][i].f + 1) * mg[k][i].f`. This condition can be simplified to `j <= N`. Since `dp[k][min(N, j)]` is already set to `INF` for `j > N`, there is no need to check the upper bound condition.

6. Optimize the outer loop: The outer loop iterates from 0 to `N`, but the actual range required is determined by the `hp` array. We can modify the loop to iterate from 0 to the maximum value in `hp` instead.

7. Use `emplace_back` instead of `push_back`: The program uses `push_back` to add elements to `mg[type == "All"]`. We can use `emplace_back` instead to construct the `P` pair directly in the vector, avoiding unnecessary copies.

8. Remove unnecessary assignment: The program assigns `dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j], dp[i][j + 1])` after the inner loop. However, this assignment is redundant as `dp[i][j]` is already set to `INF` if `j > N`.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <string>

#define INF 1e9

using namespace std;

typedef pair<int, int> P;
typedef long long ll;

int main() {
  int n, m;
  while (cin >> n, n) {
    vector<int> hp(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
      cin >> hp[i];

    vector<vector<P>> mg(2);
    cin >> m;
    mg[0].reserve(m);
    mg[1].reserve(m);
    for (int i = 0, cost, dam; i < m; i++) {
      string name, type;
      cin >> name >> cost >> type >> dam;
      if (dam)
        mg[type == "All"].emplace_back(dam, cost);
    }

    int maxHp = *max_element(hp.begin(), hp.end());
    vector<vector<int>> dp(2, vector<int>(maxHp + 10, INF));
    for (int k = 0; k < 2; k++)
      for (int i = 0; i < mg[k].size(); i++)
        for (int j = mg[k][i].first; j <= maxHp; j++)
          dp[k][min(maxHp, j)] =
              min(dp[k][min(maxHp, j)], dp[k][j - mg[k][i].first] + mg[k][i].second);

    for (int i = 0; i < 2; i++)
      for (int j = maxHp; j >= 0; j--)
        dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j], dp[i][j + 1]);

    ll ans = INF;
    for (int i = 0; i <= maxHp; i++) {
      ll cost = dp[1][i];
      for (int j = 0; j < n; j++)
        cost += dp[0][max(0, hp[j] - i)];
      ans = min(ans, cost);
    }
    cout << ans << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
