Step 1: Remove unnecessary header file inclusion.
- The original program includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header file, which is not necessary for this program. We can remove it to improve compilation time and reduce unnecessary dependencies.

Step 2: Replace `scanf` and `printf` with `cin` and `cout`.
- The original program uses the C-style input/output functions `scanf` and `printf`. We can replace them with the C++ standard input/output streams `cin` and `cout`, which are generally faster and safer.

Step 3: Optimize the calculation.
- The original program calculates `n - m - 1` and then prints the result. We can simplify this calculation by subtracting `1` from `n` before subtracting `m`.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  int n, m;
  std::cin >> n >> m;
  std::cout << n - 1 - m << std::endl;
}
```
