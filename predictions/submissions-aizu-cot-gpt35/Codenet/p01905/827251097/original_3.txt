Explanation of Optimization Steps:

1. Remove unnecessary header file inclusion: The code includes the header file `<bits/stdc++.h>`, which is not required for this program. We can remove it to improve compilation time and reduce memory usage.

2. Avoid using `scanf` and `printf` functions: The `scanf` and `printf` functions are slower compared to the `cin` and `cout` methods in C++. We can replace the `scanf` and `printf` functions with `cin` and `cout` for faster input/output operations.

3. Remove unused variables: The variables `n` and `m` are declared but not used in the program. We can remove them to improve code readability.

4. Calculate the result directly: Instead of calculating `n - m - 1`, we can directly print `n - m - 1` using `cout` for faster output.

Optimized Program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  int n, m;
  std::cin >> n >> m;
  std::cout << n - m - 1 << std::endl;
}
```
