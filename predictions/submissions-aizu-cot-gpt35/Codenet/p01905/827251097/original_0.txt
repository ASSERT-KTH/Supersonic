Explanation of the optimization steps:

1. Remove unnecessary header file inclusion: The `<bits/stdc++.h>` header file includes a large number of standard library headers, which can slow down the compilation process. In this program, it is not necessary to include this header file as it is not used. Therefore, it can be removed.

2. Optimize input and output: The `scanf` and `printf` functions in C/C++ can be slower compared to other input/output functions like `cin` and `cout`. By using `cin` and `cout`, we can potentially improve the performance of the program.

3. Simplify the expression: The expression `n - m - 1` can be simplified to `n - m - 1`.

Optimized program:

```c++
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  int n, m;
  std::cin >> n >> m;
  std::cout << n - m - 1 << std::endl;
}
```
