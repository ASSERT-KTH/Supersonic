The given program is a simple C/C++ program that takes two integers as input and prints the result of subtracting the second integer from the first integer, minus 1.

To optimize this program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove the unnecessary `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` line. This line includes a large number of header files, which can increase the compilation time and memory usage. Since the program doesn't use any specific header files, we can remove this line.

2. Replace the `scanf` and `printf` functions with the `std::cin` and `std::cout` streams. The `scanf` and `printf` functions are slower than the `std::cin` and `std::cout` streams, especially when dealing with large inputs. By using the streams, we can improve the program's performance.

3. Change the data type of the variables `n` and `m` from `int` to `long long`. This is to ensure that the program can handle larger input values without causing overflow.

After applying these optimizations, the optimized program will look like this:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  long long n, m;
  std::cin >> n >> m;
  std::cout << n - m - 1 << std::endl;
}
```
