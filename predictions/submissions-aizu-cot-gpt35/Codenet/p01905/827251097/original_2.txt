This C++ program takes two integers as input and subtracts the second integer from the first integer and then subtracts 1 from the result. The final result is then printed.

To optimize this program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary header file inclusion (`#include <bits/stdc++.h>`): This header file includes a large number of standard library headers, which can increase compile time and memory usage. Since we only need `stdio.h` for `scanf` and `printf`, we can include only that header.

2. Replace `scanf` and `printf` with faster I/O functions: The `scanf` and `printf` functions are generally slower compared to their counterparts `scanf_s` and `printf_s`. By using these faster I/O functions, we can improve the program's performance.

3. Eliminate the need for a separate variable for storing the result: Instead of storing the result in a separate variable and then printing it, we can directly print the result of the subtraction operation.

With these optimizations in mind, here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  int n, m;
  scanf_s("%d%d", &n, &m);
  printf("%d\n", n - m - 1);
  return 0;
}
```
