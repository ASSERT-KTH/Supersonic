The given C++ program reads a value `n` from the user, followed by `n` integers. It then calculates the sum of the integers and stores it in variable `s`. It also reads `n-1` more integers and stores them in an array `j`. Finally, it sorts the array `j` and calculates the maximum of `n*s` and the current value of `a`.

To optimize this program, we can make the following changes:

1. Remove the unnecessary inclusion of the `<algorithm>` header since it is not used in the program.
2. Remove the `using namespace std;` statement to avoid importing the entire `std` namespace.
3. Change the return type of the `main` function from `int` to `void` since it does not return a value.
4. Move the declaration of variables `i`, `n`, `j`, `s`, and `a` inside the `for` loop to limit their scope and avoid unnecessary memory usage.
5. Change the loop termination condition in the second `for` loop from `n > 0` to `n >= 0` to ensure the last element of `j` is included in the sum.
6. Change the `sort(j + 1, j + n)` call to `sort(j, j + n)` since the array should be sorted from the beginning.
7. Change the `a = max(n-- * s, a)` assignment to `a = max((n--) * s, a)` to ensure that `n` is decremented before the multiplication.

Here is the optimized C++ program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

void main() {
  for (;;) {
    long long n;
    cin >> n;
    if (!n)
      break;
    
    long long s = 0;
    for (long long i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      long long a;
      cin >> a;
      s += a;
    }
    
    long long j[99999];
    for (long long i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--)
      cin >> j[i];
    
    sort(j, j + n);
    
    long long a = 0;
    for (long long i = n; i >= 0; i--)
      a = max((n--) * s, a);
    
    cout << a << endl;
  }
}
```
