The given program is a C program that reads characters from standard input and performs some operations based on the input characters. The goal is to optimize the program for running time and memory usage.

Let's analyze the original program step by step:

1. The program declares an array `R` of size 99 to store some values.

2. It declares variables `i`, `h`, and `b`.

3. The `main` function starts with a loop that reads characters from standard input using the `read` function. The read character is stored in the variable `c`.

4. Inside the loop, there is an expression `++i > 9 && memset(R, i = h = b = !printf("%d %d\n", h, b - h), 232)`. This expression has multiple parts:

   a. `++i > 9`: This condition checks if `i` is greater than 9 after incrementing it. If true, it proceeds to the next part.
   
   b. `!printf("%d %d\n", h, b - h)`: This statement prints the values of `h` and `b - h` and returns 0. The `!` operator negates the return value, so it becomes 1.
   
   c. `memset(R, i = h = b = !printf("%d %d\n", h, b - h), 232)`: This statement sets all elements of the array `R` to the value 232. It also assigns the value 1 to `i`, `h`, and `b` using the result of the `printf` statement.
   
   The purpose of this expression seems to be resetting the values of `i`, `h`, and `b` to 1 and filling the array `R` with 232 when `i` becomes greater than 9. Additionally, it prints the values of `h` and `b - h`.

5. `b += !!R[c]`: This statement increments `b` by 1 if `R[c]` is not zero. It uses the double negation `!!` to convert `R[c]` to either 0 or 1.

6. `h += !(R[c] ^= 1 << i % 5)`: This statement increments `h` by 1 if the bitwise XOR operation `R[c] ^= 1 << i % 5` results in 0. The operation flips the bits at the position determined by `i % 5` in `R[c]` and returns the previous value of `R[c]`.

Now let's optimize the program step by step:

1. The array `R` has a size of 99, but it is never accessed beyond index 255. We can reduce the size of `R` to 256 to avoid potential memory issues.

2. Instead of using the `memset` function to fill the array `R` with 232, we can initialize `R` with the desired value directly when declaring it.

3. The expression `++i > 9 && memset(R, i = h = b = !printf("%d %d\n", h, b - h), 232)` is quite complex and does multiple operations. We can simplify it by splitting it into multiple statements for better readability.

4. Instead of using the `read` function to read characters from standard input, we can use `getchar` which is a simpler alternative.

5. The bitwise XOR operation `R[c] ^= 1 << i % 5` can be simplified by using the bitwise AND operator `&` and a bitmask. This avoids the need to perform the XOR operation and retrieve the previous value of `R[c]`.

6. We can remove the unnecessary negations `!` in the statements `!printf("%d %d\n", h, b - h)` and `!!R[c]`. These negations are not needed for the intended logic.

Here's the optimized program:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

unsigned char R[256] = { 232 };
int i = 0, h = 0, b = 0;

int main() {
    int c;
    while ((c = getchar()) != EOF) {
        if (++i > 9) {
            printf("%d %d\n", h, b - h);
            i = h = b = 1;
            memset(R, 232, sizeof(R));
        }
        b += R[c];
        h += !(R[c] & (1 << (i % 5)));
        R[c] |= (1 << (i % 5));
    }
    return 0;
}
```

The optimized program retains the original logic but makes the following optimizations:

1. Reduced the size of array `R` to 256 to avoid potential memory issues.

2. Initialized `R` with the value 232 directly when declaring it.

3. Split the complex expression into multiple statements for better readability.

4. Replaced `read` with `getchar` for reading characters from standard input.

5. Simplified the bitwise XOR operation to a bitwise AND operation with a bitmask.

6. Removed unnecessary negations in the statements.
