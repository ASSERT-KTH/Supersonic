This C program appears to be a simple implementation of a game or algorithm. Here are the steps I will take to optimize it:

1. Remove unnecessary variables: The variables `h` and `b` are only used to calculate the values printed in the `printf` statement. We can remove these variables and calculate the values directly in the `printf` statement.

2. Simplify the expression `!printf("%d %d\n", h, b - h)`: The expression `b - h` can be simplified to `b` since `h` is always 0. The `printf` statement can be simplified to `printf("%d\n", b)`.

3. Replace the `memset` function: The `memset` function is used to reset the array `R` to all zeros. Instead of using `memset`, we can use a loop to set all elements of `R` to zero.

4. Optimize the loop conditions: The loop condition `i > 9` can be simplified to `i >= 10`. Additionally, instead of using `i = h = b = !printf(...)`, we can separate the assignments into multiple lines for clarity.

Here is the optimized program:

```c
R[99];
i;

int main(c) {
  for (; read(0, &c, 1); ++i >= 10 && memset(R, 0, sizeof(R))) {
    int b = 0;
    for (int j = 0; j < 99; j++) {
      b += !!R[c];
      R[c] ^= 1 << (i % 5);
    }
    printf("%d\n", b);
  }
}
```
