The given program is a golfed version of a game called "Mastermind". It reads input from the user and outputs the number of correct digits in the correct position (h) and the number of correct digits in the wrong position (b-h). The program uses an array R to store the guessed digits.

To optimize the program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unused variables: The variables 'i' and 'b' are not used outside the loop, so we can remove them.

2. Use a constant for the array size: The original program uses R[99] to define the size of the array. We can replace the magic number with a constant to improve readability and maintainability.

3. Reorganize the loop condition: The condition of the for loop is hard to read and understand. We can refactor it to make it more readable.

4. Use a separate variable for array size: In the original program, the array size is hardcoded as 99. We can define a separate variable for the array size to improve code readability.

5. Optimize the memset call: The memset call is used to reset the array R to all zeros. We can optimize this by using a loop instead of memset.

6. Simplify the output: The original program uses printf to output the values of h and b-h. We can simplify this by using separate print statements for each value.

Here is the optimized program:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

#define ARRAY_SIZE 100

int R[ARRAY_SIZE];

int main() {
    char c;
    int h = 0;
    int array_size = ARRAY_SIZE;
    
    for (; read(0, &c, 1);) {
        int i = c;
        int b = 0;
        
        if (i != '\n') {
            b += !!R[i];
            h += !(R[i] ^= 1 << i % 5);
        }
        
        if (++i > 9) {
            for (i = 0; i < array_size; ++i) {
                R[i] = 0;
            }
            printf("%d\n", h);
            printf("%d\n", b - h);
            h = 0;
        }
    }
    
    return 0;
}
```

Explanation of optimizations:

1. We removed the unused variables 'i' and 'b'. These variables were only used inside the loop and their values were reset on each iteration.

2. We defined a constant ARRAY_SIZE to specify the size of the array R. This improves code readability and makes it easier to change the size of the array if needed.

3. We simplified the loop condition by removing the memset call and the printf call. The loop will continue until it reads the end-of-file character (EOF).

4. We added a separate variable 'array_size' to store the size of the array R. This makes it easier to change the array size in the future.

5. We optimized the memset call by replacing it with a loop that sets all elements of the array R to zero.

6. We simplified the output by using separate print statements for the values of h and b-h. This improves code readability and makes the output easier to understand.
