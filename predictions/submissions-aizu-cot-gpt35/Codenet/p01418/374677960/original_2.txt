The given program is a recursive function `dfs` that calculates the probability of a certain event occurring. The function takes in several parameters, including `d` which represents the current depth of the recursion, and `l` and `r` which represent the lower and upper bounds of the range being considered.

To optimize the program for running time and memory usage, we can make a small modification to the recursion by reducing the number of recursive calls and avoiding redundant calculations. 

Here's the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int K, R, L;
double P, E, T;
double dp[105][1005];

double dfs(int d, double l, double r) {
  if (dp[d][r] != -1.0) {
    return dp[d][r];
  }
  
  double mid = (l + r) / 2;
  if (!d) {
    dp[d][r] = (T - E < mid && mid < T + E) ? 1.0 : 0.0;
    return dp[d][r];
  }
  
  if (r < T - E || T + E < l) {
    dp[d][r] = 0.0;
    return dp[d][r];
  }
  
  if (mid >= T) {
    dp[d][r] = (1.0 - P) * dfs(d - 1, l, mid) + P * dfs(d - 1, mid, r);
  } else {
    dp[d][r] = (1.0 - P) * dfs(d - 1, mid, r) + P * dfs(d - 1, l, mid);
  }
  
  return dp[d][r];
}

int main() {
  cin >> K >> L >> R >> P >> E >> T;
  
  // Initialize dp array with -1.0
  memset(dp, -1.0, sizeof(dp));
  
  printf("%.9f\n", dfs(K, L, R));
  return 0;
}
```

Explanation of the optimization steps:
1. We introduce a 2D array `dp` to store the results of previous calculations. This allows us to avoid redundant recursive calls and improve the running time by memoizing the results.
2. We check if the value has already been calculated for the current depth `d` and the range `r` before making any recursive calls. If the value is already calculated, we return it directly from the `dp` array.
3. We initialize the `dp` array with -1.0 to indicate that the values have not been calculated yet.
4. In the base case where `d` is 0, we calculate the probability using the given condition and store it in the `dp` array before returning it.
5. We update the recursive calls to store the calculated values in the `dp` array before returning them.
6. We add a `main` function to handle input and output, and initialize the `dp` array before calling the `dfs` function.

These optimizations help to improve the running time and memory usage of the program by avoiding redundant calculations and reusing the stored results.
