The given program is using a recursive depth-first search (DFS) algorithm to calculate a probability. 

To optimize the program for running time and memory usage, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove the unnecessary include statement for the `<bits/stdc++.h>` library. This library includes all standard libraries, which can increase compilation time and memory usage.

2. Change the return type of the `dfs` function from `double` to `int` since the function returns either 0 or 1.

3. Replace the `printf` statement with `cout` for better performance.

4. Instead of using floating-point arithmetic for the `mid` calculation, we can use integer arithmetic by multiplying `l` and `r` by a large constant (e.g., 10^9) and then dividing `mid` by the same constant. This will eliminate any floating-point errors and improve performance.

5. Change the `if` condition in the base case from `(T - E < mid && mid < T + E)` to `(abs(T - mid) <= E)`. This will avoid floating-point comparisons and improve performance.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int K, R, L;
double P, E, T;

int dfs(int d, int l, int r) {
  int mid = (l + r) / 2;
  if (!d)
    return (abs(T - mid) <= E) ? 1 : 0;
  if (r < T - E || T + E < l)
    return 0;
  if (mid >= T)
    return (1 - P) * dfs(d - 1, l, mid) + P * dfs(d - 1, mid, r);
  return (1 - P) * dfs(d - 1, mid, r) + P * dfs(d - 1, l, mid);
}

int main() {
  cin >> K >> L >> R >> P >> E >> T;
  cout << fixed << setprecision(9) << dfs(K, L, R) << endl;
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized program will have improved running time and memory usage compared to the original program.
