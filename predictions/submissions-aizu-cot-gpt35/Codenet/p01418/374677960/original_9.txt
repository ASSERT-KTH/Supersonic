Explanation of the optimization steps:

1. Remove unnecessary headers: The program includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header which includes a large number of standard library headers. This can slow down the compilation process and increase memory usage. Since the program does not use any specific headers from `<bits/stdc++.h>`, it can be removed.

2. Avoid using `using namespace std;`: While it may seem convenient to use `using namespace std;` to avoid typing `std::` before standard library functions, it is generally considered bad practice as it can lead to naming conflicts. Instead, we can use the `std::` prefix explicitly for standard library functions.

3. Optimize the division operation: In the `dfs` function, there is a division operation `(l + r) / 2` to calculate the midpoint. Division operations can be expensive, especially when dealing with floating-point numbers. Instead of dividing by 2, we can multiply by 0.5 to achieve the same result, which is faster.

4. Replace `printf` with `cout`: The program uses `printf` to print the result with a precision of 9 decimal places. However, `printf` is slower than `cout` for simple output operations. We can use `std::cout` instead of `printf` to improve the performance.

5. Remove the `main` function return type: The `main` function does not have a return type specified. According to the C++ standard, the return type of `main` should be `int`. Since the program does not return any value, we can change the return type of `main` to `int`.

Optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

double dfs(int d, double l, double r) {
  double mid = 0.5 * (l + r);
  if (!d)
    return (T - E < mid && mid < T + E) ? 1 : 0;
  if (r < T - E || T + E < l)
    return 0;
  if (mid >= T)
    return (1.0 - P) * dfs(d - 1, l, mid) + P * dfs(d - 1, mid, r);
  return (1.0 - P) * dfs(d - 1, mid, r) + P * dfs(d - 1, l, mid);
}

int main() {
  int K, L, R;
  double P, E, T;
  std::cin >> K >> L >> R >> P >> E >> T;
  std::cout.precision(9);
  std::cout << std::fixed << dfs(K, L, R) << std::endl;
  return 0;
}
```
