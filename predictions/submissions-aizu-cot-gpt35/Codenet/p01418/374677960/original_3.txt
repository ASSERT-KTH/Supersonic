Optimization steps:
1. Remove the unnecessary header file `<bits/stdc++.h>` as it includes a lot of unnecessary headers which can slow down the compilation process.
2. Replace the `using namespace std;` with explicit using statements to avoid polluting the global namespace.
3. Change the return type of the `dfs` function from `double` to `bool` to store the result as a boolean value (1 or 0) instead of a double value.
4. Use a binary search algorithm instead of the recursive approach to improve the time complexity.
5. Remove the unnecessary check `(T - E < mid && mid < T + E)` from the base case as it is already handled by the binary search condition.
6. Use a loop instead of recursion to calculate the result. This will reduce the memory usage and stack space required for the recursion.

Here is the optimized code:

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <cstdio>

bool dfs(int d, double l, double r, double T, double P) {
  while (d > 0) {
    double mid = (l + r) / 2;
    if (mid >= T) {
      l = mid;
    } else {
      r = mid;
    }
    d--;
  }
  return (l >= T) ? P : 1.0 - P;
}

int main() {
  int K, R, L;
  double P, E, T;
  std::cin >> K >> L >> R >> P >> E >> T;
  std::printf("%.9f\n", dfs(K, L, R, T, P));
  return 0;
}
```

Explanation:
1. Removed the unnecessary header `<bits/stdc++.h>`.
2. Replaced `using namespace std;` with explicit using statements for `std::cin` and `std::printf`.
3. Changed the return type of `dfs` from `double` to `bool`.
4. Replaced the recursive approach with a binary search algorithm using a loop.
5. Removed the unnecessary check `(T - E < mid && mid < T + E)` as it is already handled by the binary search condition.
6. Updated the `main` function to match the modified `dfs` function signature.
