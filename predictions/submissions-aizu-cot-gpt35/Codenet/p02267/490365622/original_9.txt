To optimize the given program, we can use a different data structure to store the elements of S[]. Instead of using a regular array, we can use a hash set or a hash table to improve the search time.

Here are the steps to optimize the program:

1. Replace the regular array S[] with a hash set or a hash table. This will allow us to search for elements in constant time instead of linear time.

2. Initialize the hash set or hash table.

3. Read the value of n from the input.

4. Read the elements of S[] and insert them into the hash set or hash table.

5. Read the value of q from the input.

6. Initialize cnt to 0.

7. Read the elements of T[] and for each element, check if it exists in the hash set or hash table. If it does, increment cnt.

8. Print the value of cnt.

Here is the optimized program:

```
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unordered_set>

int main() {
  int n, q, i, cnt = 0;
  std::unordered_set<int> S;
  
  scanf("%d", &n);
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    int num;
    scanf("%d", &num);
    S.insert(num);
  }
  
  scanf("%d", &q);
  for (i = 0; i < q; i++) {
    int num;
    scanf("%d", &num);
    if (S.find(num) != S.end()) {
      cnt++;
    }
  }
  
  printf("%d\n", cnt);
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized program replaces the regular array S[] with an unordered_set<int> S. The elements of S[] are inserted into the unordered_set using the insert() function. During the search, we use the find() function of the unordered_set to check if an element exists. This search operation has an average time complexity of O(1).

Overall, this optimization reduces the time complexity of the search operation from O(n) to O(1), resulting in a significant improvement in running time. Additionally, the memory usage is also optimized as the unordered_set dynamically adjusts its size to accommodate the elements.
