Step 1: Avoid unnecessary large array sizes

In the original program, the array `S` has a size of 10,000 and the array `T` has a size of 500. However, the actual number of elements in these arrays is determined by the user input `n` and `q`. So, we can optimize the program by using dynamic memory allocation to create arrays of the required sizes.

Step 2: Use a more efficient search algorithm

The current search algorithm is a simple linear search, which has a time complexity of O(n*q). This can be improved by using a more efficient algorithm such as binary search or hashing.

Step 3: Optimize the loop order

The current nested loops iterate over `q` and `n`, which can be inefficient if `q` is much larger than `n`. By swapping the loops, we can improve cache locality and potentially reduce the number of cache misses.

Based on these optimization steps, here is the optimized program:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int binarySearch(int arr[], int size, int target) {
  int low = 0, high = size - 1;
  while (low <= high) {
    int mid = low + (high - low) / 2;
    if (arr[mid] == target)
      return 1;
    else if (arr[mid] < target)
      low = mid + 1;
    else
      high = mid - 1;
  }
  return 0;
}

int main() {
  int n, *S, q, *T, i, cnt = 0;
  scanf("%d", &n);
  S = (int *)malloc(n * sizeof(int));
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++)
    scanf("%d", &S[i]);

  scanf("%d", &q);
  T = (int *)malloc(q * sizeof(int));
  for (i = 0; i < q; i++)
    scanf("%d", &T[i]);

  for (i = 0; i < n; i++)
    cnt += binarySearch(T, q, S[i]);

  printf("%d\n", cnt);

  free(S);
  free(T);

  return 0;
}
```

Explanation of the optimization steps:

1. Instead of using fixed-size arrays, `S` and `T`, we use dynamic memory allocation (`malloc`) to create arrays of the required sizes based on user input `n` and `q`.

2. We introduce a binary search function (`binarySearch`) to search for elements in the `T` array. This function has a time complexity of O(log q) for each search, which is more efficient than the previous linear search.

3. We optimize the loop order by iterating over the `n` array first, and then performing the binary search on the `T` array. This improves cache locality and potentially reduces cache misses.

4. We free the dynamically allocated memory using `free` to avoid memory leaks.
