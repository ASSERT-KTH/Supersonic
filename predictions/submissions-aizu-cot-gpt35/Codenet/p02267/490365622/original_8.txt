Step 1: Reduce the size of the arrays S and T
- The arrays S and T are currently allocated with fixed sizes of 10000 and 500 respectively. However, the actual number of elements used may be much smaller. We can optimize memory usage by dynamically allocating these arrays based on the user input.

Step 2: Use a more efficient search algorithm
- The current program uses a nested loop to compare each element of T with each element of S, resulting in a time complexity of O(n*q). We can optimize the search process by using a more efficient algorithm, such as binary search, which has a time complexity of O((n+q) log n).

Based on these steps, here is the optimized program:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int binarySearch(int arr[], int low, int high, int key) {
  while (low <= high) {
    int mid = low + (high - low) / 2;
    if (arr[mid] == key)
      return 1;
    else if (arr[mid] < key)
      low = mid + 1;
    else
      high = mid - 1;
  }
  return 0;
}

int main() {
  int n, q, *S, *T, i, cnt = 0;
  scanf("%d", &n);
  S = (int*)malloc(n * sizeof(int));
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++)
    scanf("%d", &S[i]);
  scanf("%d", &q);
  T = (int*)malloc(q * sizeof(int));
  for (i = 0; i < q; i++)
    scanf("%d", &T[i]);
  for (i = 0; i < q; i++)
    cnt += binarySearch(S, 0, n - 1, T[i]);
  printf("%d\n", cnt);
  free(S);
  free(T);
  return 0;
}
```

Explanation:
1. We added the `stdlib.h` header file to use the `malloc` and `free` functions for dynamic memory allocation and deallocation.
2. We replaced the fixed-size arrays `S` and `T` with dynamically allocated arrays using `malloc` and `sizeof` to allocate memory based on the user input.
3. We implemented a binary search function `binarySearch` which takes an array, the lower and upper bounds, and the key to search for. The function returns 1 if the key is found, and 0 otherwise.
4. In the main program, we replaced the nested loops with a single loop that calls the `binarySearch` function for each element of `T`. We increment `cnt` if the key is found.
5. Finally, we added `free` statements to deallocate the dynamically allocated memory for `S` and `T` before returning from the program.
