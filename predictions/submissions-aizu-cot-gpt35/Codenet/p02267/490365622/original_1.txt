Step 1: Reduce the size of the arrays

The given program declares two arrays `S` and `T` with sizes of 10000 and 500 respectively. However, the user input limits for these arrays are not specified. To optimize memory usage, we can reduce the sizes of these arrays to match the actual input limits.

Step 2: Use a more efficient search algorithm

Currently, the program uses a simple linear search algorithm to find matching elements between the arrays `T` and `S`. This algorithm has a time complexity of O(n*q), where n is the size of array `S` and q is the size of array `T`.

To optimize the running time, we can use a more efficient search algorithm such as binary search. By sorting the array `S` and using binary search, we can reduce the time complexity to O(n*log(n) + q*log(n)), assuming n > q.

Step 3: Modify the program

Taking into account the optimization steps above, we can modify the program as follows:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int compare(const void* a, const void* b) {
    return (*(int*)a - *(int*)b);
}

int binarySearch(int arr[], int low, int high, int key) {
    if (high >= low) {
        int mid = low + (high - low) / 2;

        if (arr[mid] == key)
            return mid;

        if (arr[mid] > key)
            return binarySearch(arr, low, mid - 1, key);

        return binarySearch(arr, mid + 1, high, key);
    }

    return -1;
}

int main() {
    int n, *S, q, *T, i, cnt = 0;
    scanf("%d", &n);
    
    S = (int*)malloc(n * sizeof(int));
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++)
        scanf("%d", &S[i]);

    scanf("%d", &q);
    T = (int*)malloc(q * sizeof(int));
    for (i = 0; i < q; i++)
        scanf("%d", &T[i]);

    qsort(S, n, sizeof(int), compare);

    for (i = 0; i < q; i++) {
        if (binarySearch(S, 0, n - 1, T[i]) != -1)
            cnt++;
    }

    printf("%d\n", cnt);

    free(S);
    free(T);

    return 0;
}
```

Explanation:

- Step 1: The sizes of arrays `S` and `T` are reduced to match the actual input limits.
- Step 2: A comparison function `compare` is added for sorting the array `S` using `qsort` function.
- Step 3: A binary search function `binarySearch` is added to perform binary search on the sorted array `S`.
- Step 4: Memory allocation and deallocation are used for arrays `S` and `T`.
- Step 5: The array `S` is sorted using `qsort` function.
- Step 6: The modified program performs a binary search for each element of array `T` and increments `cnt` if a match is found.
- Step 7: The modified program frees the allocated memory before returning.
