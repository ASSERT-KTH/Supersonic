The given program is a simple program to count the number of occurrences of elements in two arrays. It takes input for the size of the first array, the elements of the first array, the size of the second array, and the elements of the second array. Then it counts the number of occurrences of each element in the second array in the first array and prints the count.

To optimize the program, we can make the following improvements:

1. Reduce the size of the arrays: The current program uses fixed-size arrays of 10000 and 500 elements. We can reduce the size of these arrays to the actual number of elements entered by the user to save memory.

2. Use a more efficient algorithm to count occurrences: The current program uses a nested loop to compare each element of the second array with each element of the first array. This has a time complexity of O(n*q), where n is the size of the first array and q is the size of the second array. We can use a more efficient approach by using a hash set or map to keep track of the elements of the first array, and then iterate over the elements of the second array to count the occurrences in O(q) time.

Based on these optimizations, here is the optimized C++ program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_set>
#include <vector>

int main() {
  int n, q;
  std::cin >> n;
  
  std::unordered_set<int> S;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    int num;
    std::cin >> num;
    S.insert(num);
  }
  
  std::cin >> q;
  
  int cnt = 0;
  for (int j = 0; j < q; j++) {
    int num;
    std::cin >> num;
    if (S.find(num) != S.end()) {
      cnt++;
    }
  }
  
  std::cout << cnt << std::endl;
  
  return 0;
}
```

Explanation:

1. We include the necessary headers for unordered_set, vector, and iostream.

2. We declare the variables n and q to store the sizes of the arrays.

3. We read the value of n from the input.

4. We declare an unordered_set S to store the elements of the first array. This unordered_set will act as a hash set to efficiently check if an element is present in the set.

5. We iterate n times and read each element of the first array, inserting it into the unordered_set S.

6. We read the value of q from the input.

7. We declare a variable cnt to store the count of occurrences.

8. We iterate q times and read each element of the second array.

9. We use the find() function of the unordered_set to check if the element is present in the set. If it is present, we increment the count.

10. Finally, we print the count of occurrences.

11. We return 0 to indicate successful execution of the program.
