Step 1: Reduce unnecessary includes
- The code includes `<bits/stdc++.h>`, which is a non-standard header and includes a large number of standard headers. This can increase the compilation time and memory usage unnecessarily.
- We can replace it with the specific standard headers that are actually needed for this code: `<iostream>`, `<vector>`, and `<algorithm>`.

Step 2: Optimize the graph representation
- The code uses an adjacency list representation to store the graph in the `G` vector. However, it is not necessary to use a vector of vectors for this purpose.
- We can optimize the memory usage by using a single vector of sets instead. Each element of the vector will represent a node, and the set will store the outgoing edges from that node.
- This will reduce the memory usage and provide faster access to the outgoing edges.

Step 3: Optimize the dynamic programming
- The code uses a three-dimensional dynamic programming array `dp` to store the results of subproblems. However, we can optimize this array to reduce memory usage.
- Since the state `dp[i][j][k]` only depends on the previous state `dp[i-1][j][k]`, we can replace the three-dimensional array with a two-dimensional array `dp[2][N][N]`.
- We can use an integer variable `cur` to represent the current iteration, where `cur` is either 0 or 1. This way, we can alternate between the two rows of the `dp` array without using extra memory.
- This optimization reduces the memory usage and improves cache efficiency.

Step 4: Optimize the loop conditions
- The condition in the innermost loop of the main loop `for (int k = 0; k < N; k++)` can be optimized.
- Instead of iterating over all nodes, we can iterate only over the nodes that have outgoing edges from the current node `k`. This will reduce unnecessary iterations and improve the running time.

Step 5: Optimize the search for valid nodes
- The code uses nested loops to check if a node is valid. However, we can optimize this search to reduce the number of iterations.
- We can maintain a counter `cnt` to count the number of valid nodes for each node `i`. If `cnt` reaches 3, we can immediately add the node to the `idx` vector and continue to the next node.
- This optimization reduces unnecessary iterations and improves the running time.

Step 6: Optimize the termination condition
- The code uses a `break` statement to terminate the main loop when no more valid nodes are found. However, we can optimize this termination condition.
- Instead of using a boolean variable `ok` and checking it at each iteration, we can directly use the `idx` vector to determine if there are any valid nodes. If the `idx` vector is empty, we can break out of the loop.
- This optimization simplifies the termination condition and improves the running time.

Step 7: Optimize the output
- The code outputs the result using `cout` multiple times. However, we can optimize this by using a single `cout` statement at the end to output the result.
- This reduces the number of output operations and improves the running time.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

const int MAX_N = 51;
const int MAX_M = 101;

int N, M;
int A[3];
vector<set<int>> G(MAX_N);
bool used[MAX_N];
bool dp[2][MAX_N][MAX_N];

int main() {
  cin >> N >> M;
  for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++)
    cin >> A[i];
  for (int i = 0; i < M; i++) {
    int f, t;
    cin >> f >> t;
    f--;
    t--;
    G[f].insert(t);
  }
  
  for (int i = 0; i < N; i++)
    dp[0][i][i] = true;
  
  int cur = 1;
  for (int i = 1; i < MAX_M; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j < N; j++) {
      for (int k : G[j]) {
        if (dp[1 - cur][j][k]) {
          for (int to : G[k]) {
            dp[cur][j][to] = true;
          }
        }
      }
    }
    cur = 1 - cur;
  }
  
  used[N - 1] = true;
  for (int ite = 1;; ite++) {
    vector<int> idx;
    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
      if (used[i])
        continue;
      int cnt = 0;
      for (int j = 0; j < 3; j++) {
        int a = A[j];
        for (int k : G[i]) {
          if (dp[a][k][i] && used[k]) {
            cnt++;
            break;
          }
        }
      }
      if (cnt == 3) {
        idx.push_back(i);
      }
    }
    if (idx.empty()) {
      break;
    }
    for (int i : idx) {
      used[i] = true;
      if (used[0]) {
        cout << ite << endl;
        return 0;
      }
    }
  }
  
  cout << "IMPOSSIBLE" << endl;
  return 0;
}
```
