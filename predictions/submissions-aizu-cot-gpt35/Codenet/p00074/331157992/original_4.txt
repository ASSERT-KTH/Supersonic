The given program is a simple time conversion program. It takes three integers as input representing hours, minutes, and seconds, and converts them into a different time format.

To optimize this program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove the unused variable `t` from the function signature.
2. Remove the unnecessary multiplication by `-~h` in the `for` loop condition.
3. Replace the inner `for` loop with a simple calculation to avoid unnecessary iterations.
4. Remove the redundant calculations of `t` inside the inner `for` loop.

Here is the optimized program:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  int h, m, s;
  
  while (scanf("%d%d%d", &h, &m, &s) && h != 0) {
    int t = (120 - h * 60 - m) * 60 - s;
    
    printf("%02d:%02d:%02d\n", t / 3600, (t / 60) % 60, t % 60);
    printf("%02d:%02d:%02d\n", 3 * (t / 3600), (3 * (t / 60) % 60), (3 * t) % 60);
  }
  
  return 0;
}
```

Explanation of the optimization steps:

1. Removed the unused variable `t` from the function signature.
2. Replaced the condition `scanf("%d%d%d", &h, &m, &s) * -~h` with `scanf("%d%d%d", &h, &m, &s) && h != 0`. This ensures that we continue reading input until `h` becomes 0.
3. Removed the inner `for` loop and replaced it with two separate `printf` statements. The first `printf` statement prints the original time format, and the second `printf` statement prints the converted time format.
4. Moved the calculation of `t` outside the inner `for` loop to avoid redundant calculations.
