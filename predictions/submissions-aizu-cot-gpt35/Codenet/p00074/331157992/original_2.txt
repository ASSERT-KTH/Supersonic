Explanation of the optimization steps:
1. Remove the unnecessary variable `t` from the function signature since it is not being used as a parameter.
2. Use a more descriptive variable name like `remainingTime` instead of `t` for better readability.
3. Swap the order of the loops to reduce the number of calculations in the inner loop.
4. Calculate the values `t / 3600`, `t / 60 % 60`, and `t % 60` only once and store them in variables to avoid redundant calculations in the `printf` statement.

Here is the optimized C/C++ program:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  int h, m, s;
  while (scanf("%d%d%d", &h, &m, &s) * -~h) {
    int remainingTime = (120 - h * 60 - m) * 60 - s;
    int hours = remainingTime / 3600;
    int minutes = (remainingTime / 60) % 60;
    int seconds = remainingTime % 60;

    for (int i = 0; i < 2; i++) {
      printf("%02d:%02d:%02d\n", hours, minutes, seconds);
      remainingTime *= 3;
      hours = remainingTime / 3600;
      minutes = (remainingTime / 60) % 60;
      seconds = remainingTime % 60;
    }
  }

  return 0;
}
```
