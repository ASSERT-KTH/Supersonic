Explanation of optimization steps:
1. Remove unnecessary parameters: The program does not use the `t` parameter, so we can remove it from the function signature.
2. Use a single loop: Instead of having nested loops, we can combine them into a single loop. This reduces the number of iterations and improves the overall performance.
3. Calculate the time difference once: Instead of calculating the time difference for each iteration of the loop, we can calculate it once and reuse it in the loop. This reduces redundant calculations and improves performance.
4. Avoid unnecessary multiplication: Instead of multiplying `t` by 3 in each iteration, we can multiply it once before the loop and use the result in the loop. This reduces the number of multiplications and improves performance.

Optimized program:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  int h, m, s;
  scanf("%d%d%d", &h, &m, &s);

  int t = (120 - h * 60 - m) * 60 - s;
  t *= 3;

  for (int i = 0; i < 2; i++) {
    printf("%02d:%02d:%02d\n", t / 3600, t / 60 % 60, t % 60);
    t *= 3;
  }

  return 0;
}
```
