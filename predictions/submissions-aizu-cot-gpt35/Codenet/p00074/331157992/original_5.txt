Explanation of optimization steps:

1. Remove the unused variable `t` from the function signature.

2. Initialize `h`, `m`, and `s` within the loop instead of the function signature.

3. Use a single loop instead of nested loops. This will reduce the number of iterations and improve the performance.

4. Replace the multiplication by 3 with a left shift operation by 1. This is a faster way to multiply by 2.

5. Use a temporary variable to store the result of the calculation `t / 3600` to avoid redundant calculations.

6. Remove the unnecessary `-~h` condition in the outer loop. Since `h` is always positive, we don't need to check if it is non-zero.

Optimized program:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int h, m, s;
    int t, temp;

    while (scanf("%d%d%d", &h, &m, &s) == 3) {
        t = (120 - h * 60 - m) * 60 - s;
        for (h = 2; h > 0; h--) {
            temp = t / 3600;
            printf("%02d:%02d:%02d\n", temp, (t / 60) % 60, t % 60);
            t *= 2;
        }
    }

    return 0;
}
```
