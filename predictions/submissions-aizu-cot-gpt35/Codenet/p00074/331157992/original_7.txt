The original program calculates the time remaining until the end of the day in seconds and prints it in a specific format. It uses nested loops to iterate over two different time formats.

To optimize this program, we can make the following changes:

1. Remove the unused variable `t` from the function definition.
2. Move the calculation of `t` outside of the inner loop since it does not depend on the loop variable `h`.
3. Calculate the value of `t` only once and store it in a variable.
4. Use a single loop instead of nested loops to iterate over the two time formats.
5. Use a single `printf` statement to print the time in the desired format.

Here is the optimized program:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  int h, m, s;
  scanf("%d%d%d", &h, &m, &s);
  
  int t = (120 - h * 60 - m) * 60 - s;
  
  for (int i = 0; i < 2; i++) {
    printf("%02d:%02d:%02d\n", t / 3600, (t / 60) % 60, t % 60);
    t *= 3;
  }
  
  return 0;
}
```

Explanation of the optimization steps:

1. Removed the unused variable `t` from the function definition.
2. Moved the calculation of `t` outside of the inner loop since it does not depend on the loop variable `h`.
3. Calculated the value of `t` only once and stored it in a variable.
4. Used a single loop instead of nested loops to iterate over the two time formats.
5. Used a single `printf` statement to print the time in the desired format.
