Optimization Steps:
1. Remove unnecessary includes: The `bits/stdc++.h` header includes a lot of unnecessary headers. We can remove it and include only the required headers.
2. Remove unnecessary macros: The macros `EPS`, `equals`, `PI`, and `int long long` are not used in the program. We can remove them.
3. Use `using` instead of `typedef`: Instead of using `typedef` to define `Point`, `Vector`, `Polygon`, `Segment`, `Line`, and `Circle`, we can use `using` for better readability.
4. Use pass by reference in functions: The functions that take `Polygon`, `Segment`, and `Line` as arguments should use pass by reference instead of pass by value to avoid unnecessary copying.
5. Remove unnecessary functions: The functions `norm(Vector)`, `abs(Vector)`, `isOrthogonal(Vector, Vector)`, `isOrthogonal(Point, Point, Point, Point)`, `isOrthogonal(Segment, Segment)`, `isParallel(Vector, Vector)`, `isParallel(Point, Point, Point, Point)`, `isParallel(Segment, Segment)`, `project(Segment, Point)`, `reflect(Segment, Point)`, `ccw(Point, Point, Point)`, `intersect(Point, Point, Point, Point)`, `intersect(Segment, Segment)`, `getDistanceLP(Line, Point)`, `getDistanceSP(Segment, Point)`, `getDistance(Segment, Segment)`, `getCrossPoint(Segment, Segment)`, `getCrossPoints(Circle, Line)`, `arg(Vector)`, `polar(double, double)`, `getCrossPoints(Circle, Circle)`, `contains(Polygon, Point)`, `andrewScan(Polygon)`, `isConvex(Polygon)`, `area(Polygon)`, `getCrossPointLL(Line, Line)`, `convexCut(Polygon, Line)`, `bisector(Point, Point)`, `spin(Vector, double)`, `corner(Line, Line)`, `convex_hull(Polygon)`, and `diameter(Polygon)` are not used in the program. We can remove them.
6. Use `cin` and `cout` instead of `scanf` and `printf`: We can use `cin` and `cout` for input and output instead of `scanf` and `printf` for better performance.
7. Use `double` instead of `float` for floating-point calculations: The program uses `float` for floating-point calculations, which has less precision compared to `double`. We can use `double` instead.
8. Use `emplace_back` instead of `push_back` when creating vectors: Instead of using `push_back` to add elements to vectors, we can use `emplace_back` for better performance.
9. Avoid unnecessary sorting: The `andrewScan` function sorts the input polygon unnecessarily. We can remove the sorting step.
10. Optimize the `convex_hull` function: The `convex_hull` function can be optimized by removing unnecessary copying and resizing of vectors.
