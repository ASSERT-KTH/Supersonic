The given program calculates the diameter of a polygon using the convex hull algorithm. The convex hull algorithm itself has a time complexity of O(n log n), where n is the number of points in the polygon. However, there are some optimizations that can be made to improve the running time and memory usage of the program:

1. Remove unnecessary include statements: The program includes the entire "bits/stdc++.h" library, which is not necessary for this program. Instead, only the necessary headers should be included.

2. Remove unnecessary typedefs: The program includes typedefs for Point, Vector, Polygon, Segment, Line, and Circle, but these are not used in the program. They can be removed to improve code readability.

3. Remove unnecessary functions: The program includes some functions that are not used in the main program, such as isOrthogonal, isParallel, getDistanceLP, and getCrossPoint. These functions can be safely removed.

4. Replace printf with cout: The program uses printf to print the result, but it can be replaced with cout for consistency since the rest of the program uses iostream.

5. Use double instead of int for n: The program uses int for the number of points in the polygon, but it should use double to handle cases where the number of points is not an integer.

6. Avoid unnecessary function calls: The program makes several unnecessary function calls, such as abs, cross, and dot. These function calls can be replaced with direct calculations to improve performance.

7. Avoid unnecessary calculations: The program calculates the cross product of vectors multiple times in the diameter function. This calculation can be avoided by storing the cross product in a variable and reusing it.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <cmath>
#include <iomanip>

using namespace std;

const double EPS = 1e-10;
const double PI = 3.141592653589793238;

struct Point {
  double x, y;
};

double cross(const Point& a, const Point& b) {
  return a.x * b.y - a.y * b.x;
}

double dist(const Point& a, const Point& b) {
  double dx = a.x - b.x;
  double dy = a.y - b.y;
  return sqrt(dx * dx + dy * dy);
}

double diameter(const vector<Point>& points) {
  int n = points.size();
  if (n < 2) return 0;

  vector<Point> hull;
  sort(points.begin(), points.end(), [](const Point& a, const Point& b) {
    return a.x < b.x || (a.x == b.x && a.y < b.y);
  });

  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    while (hull.size() >= 2 && cross(
        Point{points[i].x - hull[hull.size() - 2].x, points[i].y - hull[hull.size() - 2].y},
        Point{points[i].x - hull[hull.size() - 1].x, points[i].y - hull[hull.size() - 1].y}) <= 0) {
      hull.pop_back();
