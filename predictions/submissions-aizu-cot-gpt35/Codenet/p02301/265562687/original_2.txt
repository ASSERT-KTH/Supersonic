To optimize the given C++ program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The given program includes `<bits/stdc++.h>`, which includes all the standard library headers. This can increase the compilation time and memory usage. We can remove this include statement and include only the necessary headers.

2. Remove unused constants: The program defines constants like `COUNTER_CLOCKWISE`, `CLOCKWISE`, etc., but they are not used anywhere. We can remove these unused constants.

3. Remove unnecessary typedefs: The program defines typedefs for `Point`, `Vector`, `Polygon`, etc., but they are not used consistently. We can remove these typedefs.

4. Remove unnecessary functions: The program defines functions like `isOrthogonal`, `isParallel`, etc., but they are not used anywhere. We can remove these unnecessary functions.

5. Simplify the `diameter` function: The `diameter` function calculates the diameter of a polygon using the convex hull. However, we can simplify this function by directly calculating the maximum distance between any two points in the polygon. This will eliminate the need to calculate the convex hull.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <cmath>

using namespace std;

struct Point {
  double x, y;
  Point() {}
  Point(double x, double y) : x(x), y(y) {}
};

double distance(Point p1, Point p2) {
  double dx = p2.x - p1.x;
  double dy = p2.y - p1.y;
  return sqrt(dx * dx + dy * dy);
}

double diameter(const vector<Point>& points) {
  double maxDistance = 0.0;
  int n = points.size();
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    for (int j = i + 1; j < n; j++) {
      double d = distance(points[i], points[j]);
      maxDistance = max(maxDistance, d);
    }
  }
  return maxDistance;
}

int main() {
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  vector<Point> points(n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    cin >> points[i].x >> points[i].y;
  printf("%.12f\n", diameter(points));
  return 0;
}
```

Explanation:

1. We removed the unnecessary includes, typedefs, and functions to simplify the code and improve compilation time and memory usage.

2. The `diameter` function now calculates the maximum distance between any two points in the polygon directly, eliminating the need for the convex hull calculation.

3. The main function remains the same, reading input and calling the `diameter` function to calculate the diameter of the polygon.
