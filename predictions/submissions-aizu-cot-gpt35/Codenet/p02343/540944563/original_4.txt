Step 1: Remove unnecessary includes

The program includes several unnecessary headers such as `<algorithm>`, `<cmath>`, `<queue>`, `<stack>`, and `<vector>`. These headers are not used in the program and can be removed to improve compilation time and reduce memory usage.

Step 2: Remove unnecessary typedef

The program defines a typedef `ll` for `long long int`, but it is never used in the code. We can remove this typedef to simplify the code.

Step 3: Remove unnecessary macros

The program defines several unnecessary macros such as `BIG_NUM`, `MOD`, and `EPS`. These macros are not used in the code and can be removed.

Step 4: Use `vector` instead of dynamic arrays

The program uses dynamic arrays `boss` and `height` to store data. We can optimize memory usage by using `vector` instead of dynamic arrays. `vector` automatically manages memory allocation and deallocation, eliminating the need for explicit memory management.

Step 5: Optimize the `get_boss` function

The `get_boss` function uses recursion to find the boss of a given id. This can be optimized by using path compression. Path compression is a technique that makes each node in the path from a node to its root directly point to the root. This reduces the depth of the tree and improves the runtime of subsequent `get_boss` calls.

Step 6: Optimize the `unite` function

The `unite` function can be optimized by using union by rank. Union by rank is a technique that always attaches the smaller tree to the root of the larger tree. This helps keep the height of the tree small and improves the runtime of subsequent `is_same` and `unite` calls.

Here is the optimized C++ program:

```c++
#include <stdio.h>
#include <vector>

int N;

std::vector<int> boss, height;

int get_boss(int id) {
  if (boss[id] == id)
    return id;
  else {
    boss[id] = get_boss(boss[id]); // Path compression
    return boss[id];
  }
}

bool is_same(int x, int y) { return get_boss(x) == get_boss(y); }

void unite(int x, int y) {
  int boss_x = get_boss(x);
  int boss_y = get_boss(y);
  if (boss_x == boss_y)
    return;
  if (height[boss_x] > height[boss_y]) {
    boss[boss_y] = boss_x;
  } else if (height[boss_x] < height[boss_y]) {
    boss[boss_x] = boss_y;
  } else {
    boss[boss_y] = boss_x;
    height[boss_x]++;
  }
}

int main() {
  int Q, command, x, y;
  scanf("%d %d", &N, &Q);
  boss.resize(N);
  height.resize(N);
  for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
    boss[i] = i;
    height[i] = 1;
  }
  for (int i = 0; i < Q; i++) {
    scanf("%d %d %d", &command, &x, &y);
    if (command == 0) {
      unite(x, y);
    } else {
      if (is_same(x, y)) {
        printf("1\n");
      } else {
        printf("0\n");
      }
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Explanation of the optimization steps:

1. Removed unnecessary includes: `<algorithm>`, `<cmath>`, `<queue>`, `<stack>`, and `<vector>` headers are not used in the program, so they can be removed to improve compilation time and reduce memory usage.

2. Removed unnecessary typedef: The typedef for `long long int` (`ll`) is not used in the code, so it can be removed to simplify the code.

3. Removed unnecessary macros: The macros `BIG_NUM`, `MOD`, and `EPS` are not used in the code, so they can be removed to simplify the code.

4. Used `vector` instead of dynamic arrays: Replaced the dynamic arrays `boss` and `height` with `std::vector` to optimize memory usage. `vector` automatically manages memory allocation and deallocation, eliminating the need for explicit memory management.

5. Optimized `get_boss` function: Added path compression to the `get_boss` function. Path compression is a technique that makes each node in the path from a node to its root directly point to the root. This reduces the depth of the tree and improves the runtime of subsequent `get_boss` calls.

6. Optimized `unite` function: Used union by rank in the `unite` function. Union by rank is a technique that always attaches the smaller tree to the root of the larger tree. This helps keep the height of the tree small and improves the runtime of subsequent `is_same` and `unite` calls.
