The given program is implementing the Union-Find data structure to handle queries of two types: unite and is_same. The program maintains two arrays, boss and height, to represent the parent and height of each element in the Union-Find set. The program is optimized by using path compression and union by rank techniques.

To optimize the program further, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The program includes unnecessary headers like <algorithm>, <cmath>, <queue>, <stack>, <stdio.h>, and <vector>. Since these headers are not used in the code, we can remove them.

2. Remove unnecessary typedef: The program typedefs long long int to ll, but this type is not used in the code. We can remove this typedef.

3. Use const instead of #define: The program defines constants BIG_NUM, MOD, and EPS using #define. Instead, we can use const variables to define these constants.

4. Use std::array instead of dynamic arrays: The program uses dynamic arrays for boss and height. We can replace them with std::array, which provides better performance and memory usage.

5. Avoid recursion: The get_boss() function uses recursion to find the boss element. We can replace the recursive implementation with a loop to avoid the overhead of function calls.

6. Use a faster input/output method: The program uses scanf and printf for input and output. These functions can be slower compared to other input/output methods like cin and cout. We can replace scanf and printf with cin and cout for faster input/output.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <array>

const int MAX_N = 1000000;
const int BIG_NUM = 2000000000;
const int MOD = 1000000007;
const double EPS = 0.000001;

int N;
std::array<int, MAX_N> boss, height;

int get_boss(int id) {
  int root = id;
  while (boss[root] != root) {
    root = boss[root];
  }
  while (boss[id] != root) {
    int temp = boss[id];
    boss[id] = root;
    id = temp;
  }
  return root;
}

bool is_same(int x, int y) {
  return get_boss(x) == get_boss(y);
}

void unite(int x, int y) {
  int boss_x = get_boss(x);
  int boss_y = get_boss(y);
  if (boss_x == boss_y) return;

  if (height[x] > height[y]) {
    boss[boss_y] = boss_x;
  } else if (height[x] < height[y]) {
    boss[boss_x] = boss_y;
  } else {
    boss[boss_y] = boss_x;
    height[x]++;
  }
}

int main() {
  std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  std::cin.tie(nullptr);

  int Q, command, x, y;
  std::cin >> N >> Q;

  for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
    boss[i] = i;
    height[i] = 1;
  }

  for (int i = 0; i < Q; i++) {
    std::cin >> command >> x >> y;
    if (command == 0) {
      unite(x, y);
    } else {
      std::cout << is_same(x, y) << '\n';
    }
  }

  return 0;
}
```

Explanation of optimizations:

1. We removed unnecessary includes to improve compilation time and reduce unnecessary code clutter.

2. We removed the typedef for ll as it is not used in the code.

3. We used const int variables instead of #define for constants to improve type safety and enable better compiler optimizations.

4. We replaced the dynamic arrays boss and height with std::array, which provides better performance and memory usage compared to dynamic arrays.

5. We replaced the recursive implementation of get_boss with a loop to avoid the overhead of function calls. This improves runtime performance.

6. We replaced scanf and printf with cin and cout for faster input/output. The std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false) and std::cin.tie(nullptr) calls are added to disable synchronization between C and C++ standard streams, further improving input/output performance.
