The given program is implementing the Union-Find algorithm to solve a connectivity problem. The program takes inputs N and Q, where N is the number of elements and Q is the number of queries. Each query can be of two types: unite two elements or check if two elements are in the same set.

To optimize this program, we can make the following changes:

1. Use std::vector instead of dynamically allocating arrays: Instead of using `int* boss` and `int* height`, we can use `std::vector<int> boss` and `std::vector<int> height`. This will simplify the memory management and avoid potential memory leaks.

2. Avoid recursive function calls: The function `get_boss` is currently implemented using recursion. However, recursive function calls can be expensive in terms of both time and memory. We can optimize this by using a loop instead of recursion. We can iterate until we find the ultimate boss and update the boss of each element on the path to the ultimate boss.

3. Use a path compression technique: In the `get_boss` function, we can use a path compression technique to further optimize the Union-Find algorithm. Path compression involves updating the boss of each element on the path to the ultimate boss. This way, the next time we need to find the boss of an element, we can directly access it without traversing the entire path.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <cmath>
#include <queue>
#include <stack>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <vector>
typedef long long int ll;
#define BIG_NUM 2000000000
#define MOD 1000000007
#define EPS 0.000001
using namespace std;
int N;
vector<int> boss, height;
int get_boss(int id) {
  vector<int> path;
  while (boss[id] != id) {
    path.push_back(id);
    id = boss[id];
  }
  for (int i : path) {
    boss[i] = id;
  }
  return id;
}
int is_same(int x, int y) { return get_boss(x) == get_boss(y); }
void unite(int x, int y) {
  int boss_x = get_boss(x);
  int boss_y = get_boss(y);
  if (boss_x == boss_y)
    return;
  if (height[x] > height[y]) {
    boss[boss_y] = boss_x;
  } else if (height[x] < height[y]) {
    boss[boss_x] = boss_y;
  } else {
    boss[boss_y] = boss_x;
    height[x]++;
  }
}
int main() {
  int Q, command, x, y;
  scanf("%d %d", &N, &Q);
  boss.resize(N);
  height.resize(N);
  for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
    boss[i] = i;
    height[i] = 1;
  }
  for (int i = 0; i < Q; i++) {
    scanf("%d %d %d", &command, &x, &y);
    if (command == 0) {
      unite(x, y);
    } else {
      if (is_same(x, y)) {
        printf("1\n");
      } else {
        printf("0\n");
      }
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```

In this optimized program, we have replaced the arrays `boss` and `height` with `std::vector` types. We have also modified the `get_boss` function to use a loop for finding the ultimate boss and perform path compression. These changes should improve the running time and memory usage of the program.
