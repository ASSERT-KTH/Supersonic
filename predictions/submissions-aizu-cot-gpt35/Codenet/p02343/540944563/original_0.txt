Step 1: Remove unnecessary includes
- The program includes unnecessary headers such as <algorithm>, <cmath>, <queue>, <stack>.
- These headers are not used in the program and can be removed to improve compile time.

Step 2: Remove unnecessary typedef
- The program defines a typedef for long long int as ll, but it is not used anywhere in the program.
- The typedef can be removed to simplify the code.

Step 3: Use const instead of #define for constants
- The program defines constants using #define, such as BIG_NUM, MOD, and EPS.
- It is better to use const variables instead of #define to improve type safety and readability.
- The constants can be defined as const int variables.

Step 4: Use vector instead of dynamically allocated arrays
- The program uses dynamically allocated arrays for boss and height.
- Using vector instead of arrays can simplify the code and improve memory safety.
- The arrays can be replaced with vector<int>.

Step 5: Use pass-by-reference instead of pass-by-value for unite function
- The unite function takes parameters x and y by value.
- It is more efficient to pass them by reference to avoid unnecessary copying.
- The parameters can be changed to pass-by-reference.

Step 6: Use scanf and printf with %lld for long long int
- The program uses %d format specifier for long long int variables in scanf and printf.
- It should use %lld format specifier for long long int variables.

Step 7: Use endl instead of \n for newlines in printf
- The program uses "\n" for newlines in printf.
- It is more efficient to use endl instead of "\n" as endl flushes the output stream.

Step 8: Optimize the get_boss function
- The get_boss function currently uses recursion to find the boss of a given id.
- This can be optimized by using path compression.
- Path compression involves updating the boss of each visited node to the ultimate boss.
- This reduces the time complexity of finding the boss to O(log N) instead of O(N) in the worst case.
- The get_boss function can be modified to use path compression.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

const int BIG_NUM = 2000000000;
const int MOD = 1000000007;
const double EPS = 0.000001;

int N;
std::vector<int> boss, height;

int get_boss(int id) {
  if (boss[id] == id)
    return id;
  else {
    return boss[id] = get_boss(boss[id]);
  }
}

int is_same(int x, int y) { return get_boss(x) == get_boss(y); }

void unite(int& x, int& y) {
  int boss_x = get_boss(x);
  int boss_y = get_boss(y);
  if (boss_x == boss_y)
    return;
  if (height[x] > height[y]) {
    boss[boss_y] = boss_x;
  } else if (height[x] < height[y]) {
    boss[boss_x] = boss_y;
  } else {
    boss[boss_y] = boss_x;
    height[x]++;
  }
}

int main() {
  int Q, command, x, y;
  std::cin >> N >> Q;

  boss.resize(N);
  height.resize(N);

  for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
    boss[i] = i;
    height[i] = 1;
  }

  for (int i = 0; i < Q; i++) {
    std::cin >> command >> x >> y;
    if (command == 0) {
      unite(x, y);
    } else {
      if (is_same(x, y)) {
        std::cout << "1\n";
      } else {
        std::cout << "0\n";
      }
    }
  }

  return 0;
}
```
