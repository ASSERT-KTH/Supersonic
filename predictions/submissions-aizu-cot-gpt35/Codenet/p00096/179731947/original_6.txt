Step 1: Remove unnecessary headers
The program includes `<algorithm>` and `<vector>`, but these headers are not used in the program. Therefore, we can remove them to improve compile time.

Step 2: Change the data type of `dp` array
The array `dp` is declared as `unsigned long long`. However, the maximum value of `dp[j][i]` is the sum of `dp[j-k][i-1]`, where `k` is at most 1000. Therefore, the maximum value of `dp[j][i]` is `dp[j][i-1] + dp[j-1000][i-1]`. Since `dp[j-1000][i-1]` is at most `dp[j][i-1]`, the maximum value of `dp[j][i]` is `2 * dp[j][i-1]`. So, we can change the data type of `dp` array to `unsigned int` to save memory.

Step 3: Use a single loop for input and output
Instead of using a `while` loop for input and `cout` inside the loop, we can use a single loop and read the input using `cin` directly inside the loop. This can reduce the number of function calls and improve the runtime.

Based on these optimizations steps, here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  unsigned int dp[4001][5];
  for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++)
    for (int j = 0; j < 4001; j++)
      dp[j][i] = i == 1 && j <= 1000 ? 1 : 0;
  for (int i = 2; i <= 4; i++)
    for (int j = 0; j <= 4000; j++)
      for (int k = 0; k <= j && k <= 1000; k++)
        dp[j][i] += dp[j - k][i - 1];
  int n;
  while (cin >> n)
    cout << dp[n][4] << endl;
  return 0;
}
```
