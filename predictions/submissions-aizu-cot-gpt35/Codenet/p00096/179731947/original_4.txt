Step 1: Remove unnecessary includes

The program includes `<algorithm>` and `<vector>`, but these headers are not used in the program. We can remove these includes to reduce unnecessary processing and memory usage.

Step 2: Optimize the loop conditions

In the first nested loop, the condition `i == 1 && j <= 1000` is checked for every iteration. Since this condition does not change within the loop, we can move it outside the loop and assign the value directly to `dp[j][i]`. This will eliminate unnecessary checks and improve performance.

Step 3: Optimize the upper limits of the loops

In the second nested loop, the upper limit of the loop is set to `4000`. However, the maximum value of `j` is `4000` and the maximum value of `k` is `1000`. Therefore, we can limit the loop to `j <= 1000` to avoid unnecessary iterations and improve performance.

Step 4: Optimize the loop order

In the second nested loop, the loop order is `j`, `i`, `k`. However, by changing the loop order to `i`, `j`, `k`, we can improve memory access locality and potentially improve cache performance.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  unsigned long long dp[4001][5];
  
  for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++)
    for (int j = 0; j < 4001; j++)
      dp[j][i] = (i == 1 && j <= 1000) ? 1 : 0;
  
  for (int i = 2; i <= 4; i++)
    for (int j = 0; j <= 1000; j++)
      for (int k = 0; k <= j; k++)
        dp[j][i] += dp[j - k][i - 1];
  
  int n;
  while (cin >> n)
    cout << dp[n][4] << endl;
  
  return 0;
}
```

Explanation:

1. Removed unnecessary includes `<algorithm>` and `<vector>`.
2. Moved the condition `i == 1 && j <= 1000` outside the first nested loop and assigned directly to `dp[j][i]`.
3. Changed the upper limit of the second nested loop to `1000`.
4. Changed the loop order in the second nested loop to `i`, `j`, `k`.
