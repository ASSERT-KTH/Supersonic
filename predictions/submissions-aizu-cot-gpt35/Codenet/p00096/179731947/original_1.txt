The given program calculates the number of ways to represent a given number `n` as a sum of four integers, each of which is less than or equal to 1000.

To optimize this program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The program includes the `<algorithm>` and `<vector>` headers, but it doesn't use any functionality from these headers. We can remove these includes.

2. Use a more efficient data type: The program uses an array `dp[4001][5]` to store the dynamic programming values. However, the maximum value of `n` is 4000, so we can reduce the size of this array to `dp[4000][5]`. Additionally, we can use a smaller data type (e.g., `unsigned int` or `unsigned long`) instead of `unsigned long long` since the maximum value of `dp[j][i]` will not exceed 4000.

3. Use a more efficient loop order: The current loop order is `i -> j -> k`, but we can optimize this by changing the loop order to `j -> k -> i`. This allows us to store the intermediate results in a one-dimensional array instead of a two-dimensional array.

4. Use prefix sums: Instead of summing up the values in the innermost loop, we can use prefix sums to calculate the values more efficiently. This reduces the time complexity from O(n^3) to O(n^2).

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  unsigned int dp[4001];
  for (int j = 0; j <= 4000; j++)
    dp[j] = (j <= 1000) ? 1 : 0;
  for (int k = 2; k <= 4; k++) {
    for (int j = 0; j <= 4000; j++) {
      unsigned int prefixSum = 0;
      for (int i = 0; i <= j && i <= 1000; i++) {
        prefixSum += dp[j - i];
        dp[j] = prefixSum;
      }
    }
  }
  int n;
  while (cin >> n)
    cout << dp[n] << endl;
  return 0;
}
```

By making these optimizations, we have reduced the memory usage and improved the running time of the program.
