Step 1: Remove unnecessary includes

The program includes the `<algorithm>` and `<vector>` headers, but these are not used in the program. We can remove these includes to optimize the compilation time and reduce memory usage.

Step 2: Optimize the loop conditions

In the second nested loop, the condition `k <= j && k <= 1000` can be simplified. Since `k` is always less than or equal to `j` due to the loop condition, we can remove the `k <= j` check. Additionally, since `k` is always less than or equal to 1000, we can remove the `k <= 1000` check as well.

Step 3: Use a more appropriate data type

The `dp` array is currently defined as `unsigned long long`. However, this may be unnecessarily large for the problem at hand. We can use a smaller data type, such as `unsigned int` or `unsigned short`, to reduce memory usage.

Step 4: Optimize loop variable types

The loop variables `i`, `j`, and `k` are currently of type `int`. Since their values are always positive, we can change their types to `unsigned int` to optimize memory usage.

Here is the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  unsigned int dp[4001][5];
  for (unsigned int i = 0; i < 5; i++)
    for (unsigned int j = 0; j < 4001; j++)
      dp[j][i] = (i == 1 && j <= 1000) ? 1 : 0;
  for (unsigned int i = 2; i <= 4; i++)
    for (unsigned int j = 0; j <= 4000; j++)
      for (unsigned int k = 0; k <= j; k++)
        dp[j][i] += dp[j - k][i - 1];
  unsigned int n;
  while (cin >> n)
    cout << dp[n][4] << endl;
  return 0;
}
```

By making these optimizations, we have improved the efficiency of the program in terms of running time and memory usage.
