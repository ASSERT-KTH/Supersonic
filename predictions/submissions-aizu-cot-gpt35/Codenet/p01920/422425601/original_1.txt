The given program is a C++ program that solves a problem using a square root decomposition technique. The program reads an input string, performs some pre-processing on the string, and then answers several queries based on the pre-processed data.

To optimize the given program, I would suggest the following steps:

1. Remove unnecessary header files: The program includes `<bits/stdc++.h>` which includes all standard library header files. This can result in unnecessary code bloat. Instead, include the specific header files that are actually needed.

2. Avoid using macros for loop: The program uses a macro `rep` to define a loop. Instead of using a macro, use a normal `for` loop. This will make the code more readable and avoid any potential issues related to macros.

3. Remove unnecessary debug code: The program includes debug code that prints debug information to `std::cerr`. This code can be removed to improve performance.

4. Use more efficient data types: The program uses `int` and `int64_t` data types. Depending on the constraints of the problem, it might be possible to use smaller data types (e.g., `short int` or `long long int`) to reduce memory usage.

5. Optimize the `sqrt_decomp` class: The `sqrt_decomp` class has some potential areas for optimization. For example, instead of using a vector of vectors for the buckets, a single vector can be used to store all the bucket elements. This can reduce memory usage and improve cache locality. Additionally, the `update` and `bucket_sum` vectors can be combined into a single vector to further reduce memory usage.

6. Optimize the `sum` function: The `sum` function iterates over all the buckets and calculates the sum based on the `update` and `bucket_sum` vectors. This can be optimized by keeping track of the total sum as updates are made to the buckets. This way, the sum can be calculated in constant time.

7. Optimize the `query` function: The `query` function updates the buckets based on the given range and value. Currently, it iterates over each element in the range and updates the corresponding bucket. This can be optimized by calculating the start and end bucket indices and directly updating the bucket elements and bucket sums.

8. Optimize the `at` function: The `at` function returns the value at a specific index. Currently, it checks if the corresponding bucket has been updated and returns either the update value or the original bucket value. This can be optimized by directly accessing the bucket element without the need for the update check.

Based on these optimization steps, the optimized C++ program is as follows:
