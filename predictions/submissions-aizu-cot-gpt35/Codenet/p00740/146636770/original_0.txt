This program simulates a game where players take turns adding stones to a bowl. The game ends when a player adds the exact number of stones specified by the variable `p` to the bowl.

To optimize this program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove the nested for loop at the end of the program. This loop has a complexity of O(n^2) and is not necessary for the game logic. It is likely included for testing purposes and can be safely removed.

2. Use a circular array to represent the stones instead of a static array of size 50. This way, we can avoid initializing the entire array to zero in each iteration of the while loop.

3. Remove the unnecessary `using namespace std;` directive and `endl` usage. These can be replaced with the `std::` prefix to improve code clarity.

4. Simplify the logic for finding the winner. Instead of checking if the bowl is empty and the current player's stone count is equal to `p` in each iteration, we can keep track of the number of stones added by each player. When a player's stone count reaches `p`, they win.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  int stone[50] = {0};
  int n, p;

  while (true) {
    std::cin >> n >> p;
    if (n == 0 && p == 0) {
      return 0;
    }

    int bowl = p;
    int currentPlayer = 0;

    while (true) {
      if (bowl == 0) {
        bowl += stone[currentPlayer];
        stone[currentPlayer] = 0;
      } else {
        stone[currentPlayer]++;
        bowl--;

        if (stone[currentPlayer] == p) {
          std::cout << currentPlayer << '\n';
          break;
        }
      }

      currentPlayer = (currentPlayer + 1) % n;
    }
  }
}
```

This optimized program removes the unnecessary nested for loop at the end, initializes the stone array outside the while loop, removes the unnecessary `using namespace std;` directive and `endl` usage, and simplifies the logic for finding the winner.
