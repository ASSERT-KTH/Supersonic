Step 1: Remove unnecessary loop iterations

The program contains two nested loops that iterate 1,000,000 times each. These loops do not serve any purpose and can be removed to optimize the program's runtime.

Step 2: Optimize memory usage

The program declares an array `stone` of size 50 inside the while loop. This means that the array is created and destroyed in every iteration of the loop, resulting in unnecessary memory allocation and deallocation. To optimize memory usage, we can move the declaration of the `stone` array outside the while loop so that it is created only once.

Step 3: Remove unnecessary variable initialization

The variable `ans` is declared and assigned a value inside the while loop, but it is only used outside the loop. Since the loop always assigns a value to `ans` before breaking, we can remove the initialization of `ans` outside the loop.

Step 4: Eliminate unnecessary variable

The variable `flg` is used to control the loop, but it can be eliminated by using a `break` statement to exit the loop when the condition is met.

Here is the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main(void) {
  int stone[50];
  int ans; // Removed unnecessary initialization
  while (1) {
    for (int k = 0; k < 50; k++) {
      stone[k] = 0;
    }
    int bowl;
    int n, p;
    cin >> n;
    cin >> p;
    if (n == 0 && p == 0) {
      return 0;
    }
    bowl = p;
    for (int i = 0; ; i = (i + 1) % n) { // Removed unnecessary variable and condition
      if (bowl == 0) {
        bowl = bowl + stone[i];
        stone[i] = 0;
      } else {
        stone[i]++;
        bowl--;
        if (bowl == 0 && stone[i] == p) {
          ans = i;
          break; // Removed unnecessary variable
        }
      }
    }
    cout << ans << endl;
  }
}
```
