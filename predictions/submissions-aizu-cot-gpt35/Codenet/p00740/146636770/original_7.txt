The given program has a few areas that can be optimized:

1. The program unnecessarily initializes the `stone` array to 0 in every iteration of the while loop. Since the array is used only within the loop, we can move this initialization outside the loop.

2. The inner `for` loop with the limits `i < 1000000` and `j < 1000000` is not necessary and can be removed. It does not contribute to the logic of the program and only adds unnecessary computation.

3. The `using namespace std;` statement can be removed and replaced with explicit `std::` namespace qualifiers to improve code readability and reduce potential naming conflicts.

Now, let's generate the optimized program:
