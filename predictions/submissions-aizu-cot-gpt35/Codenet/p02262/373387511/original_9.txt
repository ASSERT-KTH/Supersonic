The given program implements a sorting algorithm called Shell Sort. The program first generates a sequence of gap values (G) and then performs an insertion sort for each gap value in reverse order.

To optimize the program for running time and memory usage, we can make the following modifications:

1. Avoid using the `vector` container for storing the gap values (G). Instead, we can calculate the gap values on-the-fly using the formula `h = (h - 1) / 3`. This will save memory and avoid unnecessary memory allocations.

2. Instead of using the `insertionSort` function, we can directly implement the insertion sort logic inside the `selectionSort` function. This will eliminate the need for a separate function call and improve the program's performance.

3. Remove the `cnt` variable as it is not being used for any meaningful purpose in the given program. This will save memory and eliminate unnecessary calculations.

4. Use a more efficient method to swap elements in the array. Instead of using a temporary variable, we can use the XOR swap algorithm to perform the swap operation.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

void shellSort(int *a, int n) {
  int h = 1;
  while (h < n) {
    h = 3 * h + 1;
  }
  h = (h - 1) / 3;

  while (h > 0) {
    for (int i = h; i < n; i++) {
      int j = i;
      while (j >= h && a[j - h] > a[j]) {
        // Swap elements using XOR swap algorithm
        a[j] ^= a[j - h];
        a[j - h] ^= a[j];
        a[j] ^= a[j - h];
        j -= h;
      }
    }
    h = (h - 1) / 3;
  }
}

int main() {
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  int a[n];
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> a[i];
  }

  shellSort(a, n);

  cout << n << endl;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cout << a[i] << endl;
  }

  return 0;
}
```

Explanation of the optimizations:

1. We calculate the gap values (G) on-the-fly using the formula `h = (h - 1) / 3` inside the `shellSort` function.

2. The insertion sort logic is directly implemented inside the `shellSort` function, eliminating the need for a separate function call.

3. The `cnt` variable is removed as it is not used for any meaningful purpose in the given program.

4. The XOR swap algorithm is used to swap elements in the array, which is more efficient than using a temporary variable. This optimization improves the program's performance.

Overall, these optimizations reduce memory usage and improve the running time of the program.
