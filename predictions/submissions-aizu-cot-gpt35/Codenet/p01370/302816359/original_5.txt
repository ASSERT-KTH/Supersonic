The given program uses a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to find the number of reachable cells from a given starting cell within a specific number of steps. The program uses a queue to keep track of the cells to be visited and a vector to represent the grid.

To optimize the program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary headers: The program includes several unnecessary headers such as `<algorithm>`, `<cmath>`, `<cstdio>`, and `<cstring>`. Since these headers are not used in the program, they can be safely removed.

2. Remove unused variables: The variables `n` and `cnt` are declared but not used in the program. We can remove these variables to improve readability.

3. Use a constant variable instead of a macro: The program uses a macro `max` to define the size of the grid. Instead of using a macro, we can use a constant variable to define the grid size. This will make the code more readable and avoid potential issues with macro substitution.

4. Remove unnecessary calculations: In the loop where the input coordinates are read, the variable `y` is calculated using a formula `(m_t * 2 + m_t * 2 + 1 - abs(y)) / 2`. This calculation can be simplified to `y = y * (3 * m_t + 1 - abs(y)) / 2` since `m_t * 2 + m_t * 2 + 1` is equal to `3 * m_t + 1`.

5. Avoid unnecessary field initialization: The `fill` function is used to initialize the `field` vector with `1` before setting some elements to `0`. Since the vector is already initialized with `1` by default, this step is unnecessary and can be removed.

6. Use a pair of integers instead of a pair of pairs: The queue `rt` is defined as `queue<pair<pair<int, int>, int>>`. We can simplify this to `queue<pair<int, int>>` and use a separate variable to store the step count.

7. Avoid unnecessary increment of `ans`: The program increments the `ans` variable at the beginning of the BFS loop. This can be avoided by initializing `ans` with `0` and incrementing it at the end of the loop instead.

After applying these optimizations, the optimized program will look as follows:
