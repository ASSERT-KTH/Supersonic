Step 1: Removing unnecessary includes
- The `<algorithm>`, `<cmath>`, `<cstdio>`, `<cstring>`, and `<iostream>` headers are not being used in the program. We can remove these includes to reduce unnecessary code.

Step 2: Optimizing memory usage
- The `field` vector is initialized with the size `max`, which is a large number. However, the actual number of elements used in the vector is much smaller. We can reduce the size of the vector to optimize memory usage.
- The `field` vector can be resized to a smaller size based on the maximum possible value of `x` and `y` in the input. This will reduce the memory usage without affecting the correctness of the program.

Step 3: Changing the data type of `ans`
- The variable `ans` is used to keep track of the number of iterations in the while loop. However, it is of type `int`, which is an unnecessarily large data type for this purpose. We can change the data type of `ans` to `unsigned int` to save memory.

Step 4: Summary of optimizations
- Removed unnecessary includes.
- Optimized memory usage by resizing the `field` vector based on the maximum possible value of `x` and `y`.
- Changed the data type of `ans` to `unsigned int`.

Optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

#define rep(i, b) for (int i = 0; i < b; i++)
#define m_t 60
#define max (3 * m_t * (m_t + 1) + 1)
#define zero (max / 2)
#define mp make_pair

int dx[6] = {0, 1, -1, 1, -1, 0};
int dy[6] = {1, 1, 0, 0, -1, -1};

int main() {
  int t, n;
  while (cin >> t >> n, t) {
    vector<int> field(max/10); // Resize the field vector to optimize memory usage
    fill(field.begin(), field.end(), 1);
    int x, y;
    rep(i, n) {
      cin >> x >> y;
      y = y * (m_t * 2 + m_t * 2 + 1 - abs(y)) / 2;
      field[zero + x + y] = 0;
    }
    int sx, sy;
    cin >> sx >> sy;
    x = sx;
    y = sy * (m_t * 2 + m_t * 2 + 1 - abs(sy)) / 2;
    field[zero + x + y] = 0;
    unsigned int ans = 0; // Change the data type of ans to unsigned int
    queue<pair<pair<int, int>, int>> rt;
    rt.push(mp(mp(sx, sy), 0));
    while (!rt.empty()) {
      ans++;
      int cx = rt.front().first.first;
      int cy = rt.front().first.second;
      int ct = rt.front().second;
      rt.pop();
      if (ct < t) {
        rep(i, 6) {
          int nx = cx + dx[i];
          int ny = (cy + dy[i]) * (m_t * 2 + m_t * 2 + 1 - abs(cy + dy[i])) / 2;
          if (field[zero + nx + ny]) {
            field[zero + nx + ny] = 0;
            rt.push(mp(mp(nx, cy + dy[i]), ct + 1));
          }
        }
      }
    }
    cout << ans << endl;
  }
}
