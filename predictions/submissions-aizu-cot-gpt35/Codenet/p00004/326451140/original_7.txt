Step 1: Avoid unnecessary variable declarations and assignments.

In the original program, variables `su1` and `su2` are declared and assigned values of 0 multiple times. However, these variables can be initialized only once and reused throughout the program. By eliminating unnecessary variable declarations and assignments, we can reduce the overhead of memory allocation and assignments.

Step 2: Optimize loop conditions.

In the nested loops of the `matrix` function, the loop conditions `k <= N - 2` and `j <= N - 1` can be simplified to `k < N - 1` and `j < N`, respectively. Since the loop starts with `k = 0` and `j = k + 1`, the original loop conditions are unnecessary and can be simplified to avoid unnecessary iterations.

Step 3: Remove redundant code.

In the `matrix` function, there are two identical nested loops that perform similar operations on different parts of the matrix. We can merge these two loops into one to eliminate redundancy and improve code readability.

Step 4: Optimize loop iteration limits.

In the main loop of the `main` function, the loop condition `i < N` can be replaced with `i < N - 1`. This is because the last element of each row of the matrix is printed separately, so there is no need to iterate over it in the loop.

Step 5: Use a single-dimensional array instead of a double pointer.

In the original program, the matrix `x` is represented as a double pointer. However, this introduces additional memory overhead and complexity. We can simplify the program by using a single-dimensional array to represent the matrix. This will improve memory usage and simplify the code.

Here is the optimized program:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#define N 2

void matrix(double *x);

int main(void) {
  double x[(N + 1) * N];
  double *y[N];
  int i, j;
  char str[100];

  for (; fgets(str, sizeof(str), stdin) != NULL;) {
    sscanf(str, "%lf %lf %lf %lf %lf %lf", &x[0], &x[1], &x[2],
           &x[N + 1], &x[N + 2], &x[2 * (N + 1)]);
    
    for (i = 0; i < N; i++)
      y[i] = &x[i * (N + 1)];

    matrix(x);

    for (i = 0; i < N - 1; i++) {
      printf("%3.3f ", y[i][N]);
    }
    printf("%3.3f\n", y[N - 1][N]);
  }

  return 0;
}

void matrix(double *x) {
  int i, j, k;
  double su1, su2;

  for (k = 0; k < N - 1; k++) {
    for (j = k + 1; j < N; j++) {
      su1 = x[k * (N + 1) + k];
      su2 = x[j * (N + 1) + k];

      for (i = 0; i <= N; i++) {
        x[j * (N + 1) + i] -= (x[k * (N + 1) + i] * su2 / su1);
      }
    }
  }

  su1 = 0;

  for (j = 0; j < N; j++) {
    su1 = x[j * (N + 1) + j];

    for (i = 0; i <= N; i++) {
      x[j * (N + 1) + i] /= su1;
    }
  }
}
```
