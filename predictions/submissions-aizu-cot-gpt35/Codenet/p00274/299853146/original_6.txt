Step 1: Remove unnecessary variables
- The variable `t` is not used in the program and can be removed.

Step 2: Optimize the loop
- Instead of using a `while` loop with a `break` statement, we can optimize the loop by using a `for` loop with a condition.
- The loop will run until `n` becomes zero, so we can use `n` as the loop condition instead of using a `break` statement.

Step 3: Optimize variable initialization
- The variable `flg` is initialized to zero in each iteration of the loop. We can move the initialization outside the loop to avoid unnecessary assignment.
- The variable `s` is assigned the value of `n` before the loop starts. We can initialize `s` with the value of `n` directly.

Step 4: Optimize the inner loop
- Instead of using an inner loop to check if `k` is greater than or equal to 2, we can use a single `if` statement with an `else if` condition to handle the cases.

Step 5: Use a more meaningful variable name
- Rename the variable `k` to `number` to make it more clear.

Here is the optimized C program:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
  int n, s, number, flag;

  while (scanf("%d", &n) == 1 && n != 0) {
    s = n;
    flag = 0;

    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      scanf("%d", &number);

      if (number == 0) {
        s--;
      } else if (number >= 2) {
        flag = 1;
      }
    }

    if (flag == 1) {
      printf("%d\n", s + 1);
    } else {
      printf("NA\n");
    }
  }

  return 0;
}
```
