Step 1: Remove unnecessary variables and assignments.

- The variable `t` is not used anywhere in the program and can be removed.
- The variable `s` is assigned the value of `n` at the beginning of each iteration of the while loop, which is unnecessary because it is immediately overwritten inside the loop. We can remove this assignment.

Step 2: Optimize the loop.

- Instead of checking for `n == 0` inside the loop, we can move the check to the loop condition itself. This way, we can exit the loop immediately if `n` is equal to 0, without having to go through the rest of the loop body.

Step 3: Optimize the if conditions.

- Instead of checking for `k == 0` and `k >= 2` separately, we can combine them into a single if condition by using `k > 0`. This way, we only need to perform one comparison instead of two.

Step 4: Use a more descriptive variable name.

- The variable name `flg` is not very descriptive. We can rename it to `hasNonZero` to make the code more readable.

Here is the optimized C program:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
  int n, k, hasNonZero;
  
  while (scanf("%d", &n) == 1 && n != 0) {
    hasNonZero = 0;
    
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      scanf("%d", &k);
      
      if (k > 0) {
        hasNonZero = 1;
      }
    }
    
    if (hasNonZero) {
      printf("%d\n", n);
    } else {
      printf("NA\n");
    }
  }
  
  return 0;
}
```
