The given program reads a series of integers from the user and performs some calculations based on those inputs. Here are the steps to optimize the program:

1. Remove unnecessary variables: The variable `h` is not used in the program and can be safely removed.

2. Initialize variables closer to their usage: The variable `t` is initialized to 0 at the beginning of the program but is not used until the end. We can move the initialization to the point where it is actually used, which is after the inner loop.

3. Optimize the counting of zeros: Currently, the program iterates over the input integers twice - once to count the number of zeros in the sequence and again to check if there are any integers greater than or equal to 2. We can optimize this by combining the two loops into a single loop. We can keep track of the count of zeros and the presence of integers greater than or equal to 2 in separate variables.

4. Modify the print statements: Instead of using an `if` condition to determine whether to print `NA` or the count of non-zero integers, we can directly print the result based on the value of the variable `flg`.

Here is the optimized program:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
  int s = 0, n, k, i, zeros, hasGreater;
  while (1) {
    zeros = 0;
    hasGreater = 0;
    scanf("%d", &n);
    if (n == 0)
      break;
    s = n;
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      scanf("%d", &k);
      if (k == 0) {
        zeros++;
      } else if (k >= 2) {
        hasGreater = 1;
      }
    }
    if (hasGreater) {
      printf("%d\n", s - zeros + 1);
    } else {
      printf("NA\n");
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized program reduces the number of loops and eliminates unnecessary variables, leading to improved performance in terms of running time and memory usage.
