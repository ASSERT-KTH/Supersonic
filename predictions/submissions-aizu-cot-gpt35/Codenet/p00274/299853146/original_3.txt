To optimize the given program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove the unnecessary variable `t` as it is not being used.
2. Remove the unnecessary initialization of `flg` inside the `while` loop. It can be initialized only once before the loop.
3. Instead of subtracting 1 from `s` when `k` is 0, we can increment a counter variable `zeroCount`. This eliminates the need for updating `s` in each iteration of the inner loop.
4. Instead of checking if `k >= 2` in each iteration of the inner loop, we can use a flag variable `flg` to indicate if any `k >= 2` was encountered. We can break the loop as soon as we encounter such a value, as there is no need to continue checking the remaining values.
5. After the inner loop, we can check the value of `flg` to determine the output. If `flg` is 1, we can directly print `s + 1`, otherwise, we can print "NA".

Here is the optimized code:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
  int h, s = 0, n, k, flg = 0, zeroCount = 0;
  
  while (1) {
    scanf("%d", &n);
    
    if (n == 0)
      break;
    
    s = n;
    flg = 0;
    zeroCount = 0;
    
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      scanf("%d", &k);
      
      if (k == 0) {
        zeroCount++;
      }
      
      if (k >= 2) {
        flg = 1;
        break;
      }
    }
    
    if (flg == 1) {
      printf("%d\n", s - zeroCount + 1);
    } else {
      printf("NA\n");
    }
  }
  
  return 0;
}
```

Explanation of optimizations:

1. By removing the unused variable `t`, we reduce memory usage.
2. By initializing `flg` only once before the loop, we reduce unnecessary assignments inside the loop.
3. By using `zeroCount` to count the number of zeros, we avoid updating `s` in each iteration of the inner loop, reducing unnecessary calculations.
4. By using a flag variable `flg` and breaking the loop when `k >= 2` is encountered, we avoid unnecessary iterations of the inner loop.
5. By directly printing `s - zeroCount + 1` if `flg == 1`, we reduce the number of conditional statements and improve the overall runtime efficiency.
