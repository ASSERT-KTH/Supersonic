Step 1: Remove unnecessary variable declarations and initializations.

In the given program, the variables `t` and `h` are not used. We can remove them.

Step 2: Move the declaration of `i` inside the for loop.

The variable `i` is only used inside the for loop, so we can move its declaration inside the loop.

Step 3: Optimize the loop conditions.

Currently, the while loop runs indefinitely with `while(1)`. We can modify the loop condition to check if the input value `n` is not equal to 0. This will allow the program to exit the loop when `n` is 0.

Step 4: Combine the two if conditions inside the for loop.

The two if conditions inside the for loop can be combined into a single if-else statement. If `k` is 0, decrement `s` by 1, otherwise set `flg` to 1.

Here is the optimized program:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
  int s = 0, n, k, flg;

  while (scanf("%d", &n) && n != 0) {
    s = n;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      scanf("%d", &k);
      if (k == 0) {
        s--;
      } else {
        flg = 1;
      }
    }
    if (flg == 1) {
      printf("%d\n", s + 1);
    } else {
      printf("NA\n");
    }
  }

  return 0;
}
```
