The given program takes an input integer `S`, representing the total number of seconds, and outputs the time in the format "H:M:S", where H represents hours, M represents minutes, and S represents seconds.

To optimize the program, we can eliminate the use of modulus operator `%` and perform integer division directly to calculate the hours, minutes, and seconds.

Here are the steps to optimize the program:

1. Remove the line `using namespace std;` as it is considered a bad practice.

2. Instead of using the modulus operator `%`, calculate the hours, minutes, and seconds using integer division directly.

3. Update the output format to ensure leading zeros for single-digit hours, minutes, and seconds.

The optimized program is as follows:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  int S;
  std::cin >> S;

  int hours = S / 3600;
  int minutes = (S / 60) % 60;
  int seconds = S % 60;

  std::cout << std::setfill('0') << std::setw(2) << hours << ":"
            << std::setfill('0') << std::setw(2) << minutes << ":"
            << std::setfill('0') << std::setw(2) << seconds << std::endl;

  return 0;
}
```

Explanation of optimization steps:

1. We removed the line `using namespace std;` to avoid namespace pollution.

2. Instead of using `S % 3600` to calculate the remaining seconds after calculating the hours, we directly calculate the minutes by `(S / 60) % 60`. This is because the integer division `(S / 60)` already gives us the total number of minutes, and taking the modulus by 60 ensures we only get the minutes within the range of 0 to 59.

3. We calculate the seconds directly using `S % 60`.

4. We use `std::setfill('0')` and `std::setw(2)` to ensure leading zeros for single-digit hours, minutes, and seconds in the output format.
