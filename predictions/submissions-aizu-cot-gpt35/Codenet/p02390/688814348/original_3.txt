The given program takes an input `S`, which represents the time in seconds, and converts it to the format `HH:MM:SS` and prints it.

To optimize this program, we can eliminate the unnecessary use of the modulo operator `%` multiple times. Instead, we can perform the necessary calculations using integer division `/` and store the intermediate results in variables.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main(void) {
  int S;
  cin >> S;

  int hours = S / 3600;
  S %= 3600;
  int minutes = S / 60;
  int seconds = S % 60;

  cout << hours << ":" << minutes << ":" << seconds << endl;
}
```

In this optimized version, we calculate the number of hours by dividing `S` by 3600 and store it in the `hours` variable. Then, we update `S` by taking the remainder when divided by 3600 using the `%` operator. Next, we calculate the number of minutes by dividing `S` by 60 and store it in the `minutes` variable. Finally, we calculate the number of seconds by taking the remainder when divided by 60 and store it in the `seconds` variable.

By minimizing the usage of the modulo operator `%`, we can reduce the number of calculations and improve the program's efficiency.
