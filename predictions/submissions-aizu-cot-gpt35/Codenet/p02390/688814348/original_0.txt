The given program is a simple program that takes an input in seconds and converts it to hours, minutes, and seconds format. The program uses the modulus operator extensively to calculate the hours, minutes, and seconds.

To optimize this program, we can eliminate the use of the modulus operator and reduce the number of division operations by using integer division and remainder operations.

Here are the steps to optimize the program:

1. Read the input value of S.
2. Calculate the number of hours by dividing S by 3600.
3. Calculate the remaining seconds after calculating the hours using the modulo operator (%).
4. Calculate the number of minutes by dividing the remaining seconds by 60.
5. Calculate the remaining seconds after calculating the minutes using the modulo operator (%).
6. Print the result in the desired format.

The optimized program is as follows:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main(void) {
  int S;
  cin >> S;
  int hours = S / 3600;
  int remainingSeconds = S % 3600;
  int minutes = remainingSeconds / 60;
  int seconds = remainingSeconds % 60;
  cout << hours << ":" << minutes << ":" << seconds << endl;
}
```

This optimized program reduces the number of division and modulus operations by calculating the values of hours, minutes, and seconds separately using integer division and remainder operations. This will result in improved performance and reduced memory usage.
