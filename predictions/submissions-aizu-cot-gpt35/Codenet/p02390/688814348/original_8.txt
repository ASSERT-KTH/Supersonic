The given program takes an input in seconds and converts it into hours, minutes, and seconds format. The program can be optimized by reducing the number of calculations and eliminating unnecessary operations.

Here is the step-by-step optimization process:

1. Remove unnecessary `using namespace std;` statement as it is not required in this program.

2. Instead of using the modulo operator twice, we can calculate the minutes and seconds in a single step by using integer division and modulo together.

3. Remove the endl statement, as it flushes the output stream and can be a performance bottleneck. Instead, we can use the '\n' character to print a newline.

Here is the optimized C++ program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  int S;
  std::cin >> S;
  
  int hours = S / 3600;
  int minutes = (S % 3600) / 60;
  int seconds = (S % 3600) % 60;
  
  std::cout << hours << ":" << minutes << ":" << seconds << '\n';
}
```
