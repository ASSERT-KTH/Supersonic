The given program takes an input integer `S` representing the total number of seconds, and converts it to the format `HH:MM:SS` (hours:minutes:seconds) and prints it.

To optimize the program, we can eliminate the modulo operations and reduce the number of division operations.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main(void) {
  int S;
  cin >> S;

  int hours = S / 3600;
  S -= hours * 3600;

  int minutes = S / 60;
  S -= minutes * 60;

  cout << hours << ":" << minutes << ":" << S << endl;
}
```

Explanation:
1. We read the input integer `S` from the user.
2. We calculate the number of hours by dividing `S` by 3600 and store it in the variable `hours`.
3. We subtract the number of seconds accounted for by hours from `S` by multiplying `hours` with 3600.
4. We calculate the number of minutes by dividing the remaining `S` by 60 and store it in the variable `minutes`.
5. We subtract the number of seconds accounted for by minutes from `S` by multiplying `minutes` with 60.
6. Finally, we print the values of `hours`, `minutes`, and `S` in the desired format.
