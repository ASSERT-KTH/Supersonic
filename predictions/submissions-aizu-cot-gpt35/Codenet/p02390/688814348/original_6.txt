The given program takes an integer `S` as input, which represents the number of seconds. It then converts the number of seconds into hours, minutes, and seconds format and prints it out.

To optimize this program, we can remove the division and modulus operations, and instead use integer arithmetic to calculate the hours, minutes, and seconds directly.

Here's the optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main(void) {
  int S;
  cin >> S;
  
  int hours = S / 3600;    // calculate hours
  int minutes = (S % 3600) / 60;    // calculate minutes
  int seconds = S - (hours * 3600 + minutes * 60);    // calculate seconds
  
  cout << hours << ":" << minutes << ":" << seconds << endl;
}
```

In this optimized version, we calculate the hours by dividing `S` by 3600 (the number of seconds in an hour). We calculate the minutes by taking the remainder of `S` divided by 3600 and then dividing that by 60 (the number of seconds in a minute). Finally, we calculate the seconds by subtracting the number of seconds used for hours and minutes from `S`.
