Explanation of optimization steps:

1. The original program reads an integer from the input and calculates the hours, minutes, and seconds by performing division and modulo operations. This can be improved by using integer arithmetic only.

2. The original program uses the modulus operator twice to calculate the minutes and seconds. This can be combined into a single operation.

3. The original program uses the division and modulus operators to calculate the hours separately. This can be combined into a single operation.

Optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int S;
  cin >> S;
  
  int hours = S / 3600;
  int minutes = (S % 3600) / 60;
  int seconds = S % 60;

  cout << hours << ":" << minutes << ":" << seconds << endl;
}
```
