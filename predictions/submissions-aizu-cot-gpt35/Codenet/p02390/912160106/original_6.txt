The given program takes an input integer `is` representing a duration in seconds and converts it into hours, minutes, and seconds. The program then prints the formatted duration in the format "hh:mm:ss".

To optimize the program, we can eliminate the unnecessary variable `is` and directly calculate the remaining seconds after extracting hours and minutes. This will reduce the number of arithmetic operations and improve the program's efficiency.

Here's the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  int is;
  int h, m, s;
  cin >> is;
  h = is / 3600;
  m = (is % 3600) / 60;
  s = is % 60;
  cout << h << ":" << m << ":" << s << endl;
  return 0;
}
```

In the optimized program, we calculate the remaining seconds using the modulus operator `%`. By taking the modulus of `is` with 3600, we get the remaining seconds after extracting hours. Similarly, taking the modulus of the remaining seconds with 60 gives us the minutes, and the remaining seconds represent the seconds.

This modification reduces the number of arithmetic operations and eliminates the need for the variable `is` to store the intermediate values.
