The given program calculates the hours, minutes, and seconds from a given number of seconds and prints them in the format "h:m:s".

To optimize this program, we can make a small modification to eliminate the need for reassigning the value of the variable "is" in each step.

Here are the optimization steps:

1. Remove the variable "is" and directly use the input value for calculation.
2. Calculate the hours, minutes, and seconds directly using divisions and remainders.
3. Print the calculated values directly without the need for intermediate variables.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int inputSeconds;
  cin >> inputSeconds;

  int hours = inputSeconds / 3600;
  int minutes = (inputSeconds % 3600) / 60;
  int seconds = inputSeconds % 60;

  cout << hours << ":" << minutes << ":" << seconds << endl;

  return 0;
}
```
