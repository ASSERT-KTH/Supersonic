The given program takes an input value in seconds and converts it to hours, minutes, and remaining seconds. The program then outputs the converted time in the format "hours:minutes:seconds".

To optimize this program, we can reduce the number of arithmetic operations by using the modulo operator `%` instead of repeated subtraction. Additionally, we can avoid unnecessary variable declarations.

Here is the optimized program:

```
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  int is;
  cin >> is;
  int h = is / 3600;
  int m = (is % 3600) / 60;
  int s = is % 60;
  cout << h << ":" << m << ":" << s << endl;
  return 0;
}
```

Explanation of optimization steps:
1. Remove unnecessary variable declarations: We can directly declare and initialize `h`, `m`, and `s` in a single line where they are used.
2. Replace repeated subtraction with modulo operator: Instead of subtracting multiples of 3600 and 60 from `is`, we can use the modulo operator `%` to calculate the remaining seconds after calculating hours and minutes respectively.
