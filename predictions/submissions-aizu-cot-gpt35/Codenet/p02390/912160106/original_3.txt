Explanation of Optimization Steps:

1. Remove unnecessary variable declarations: The variables `h`, `m`, `s` are not used in the program. We can safely remove them.

2. Combine the calculations for `h`, `m`, `s`: Instead of performing separate calculations for `h`, `m`, and `s`, we can perform the calculations in a single step by utilizing the modulo operator `%`. This will reduce the number of operations and simplify the code.

3. Remove unnecessary subtraction operations: Instead of subtracting the calculated hours and minutes from the input value, we can directly calculate the remaining seconds using the modulo operator `%`. This will eliminate the need for subtraction operations and simplify the code further.

4. Remove unnecessary `using` directive: The `using namespace std;` directive is not necessary in this program as we are only using `cin` and `cout` which are already qualified with `std::`. We can remove the `using namespace std;` directive to improve code readability and avoid potential naming conflicts.

Optimized Program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  int is;
  std::cin >> is;

  int h = is / 3600;
  int m = (is % 3600) / 60;
  int s = is % 60;

  std::cout << h << ":" << m << ":" << s << std::endl;

  return 0;
}
```
