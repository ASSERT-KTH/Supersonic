Step 1: Remove unnecessary variable declarations and assignments.

Since we are only interested in the hours, minutes, and seconds, we can remove the variable `is` and directly use the input value for calculations.

Step 2: Optimize the calculations.

Instead of subtracting the hours and minutes from the input value, we can use the modulo operator to get the remaining seconds after calculating the hours and minutes.

Step 3: Remove unnecessary `using` statement.

We can remove the `using namespace std;` statement since we are explicitly using `std::cin` and `std::cout`.

Here is the optimized program:

```c++
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  int input;
  std::cin >> input;

  int hours = input / 3600;
  int minutes = (input % 3600) / 60;
  int seconds = (input % 3600) % 60;

  std::cout << hours << ":" << minutes << ":" << seconds << std::endl;
  return 0;
}
```
