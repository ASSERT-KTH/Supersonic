The given program takes an input integer `is` representing the number of seconds and converts it into hours, minutes, and seconds. The program then outputs the time in the format "hours:minutes:seconds".

To optimize this program, we can eliminate the unnecessary variable `is` and perform the calculations directly on the input variable. This will save memory usage.

Furthermore, we can remove the `using namespace std;` line and explicitly specify the `std` namespace for `cout` and `cin`. This will avoid any potential naming conflicts.

Here is the optimized program:

```c++
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  int input_seconds;
  int hours, minutes, seconds;
  std::cin >> input_seconds;
  
  hours = input_seconds / 3600;
  input_seconds = input_seconds % 3600;
  
  minutes = input_seconds / 60;
  seconds = input_seconds % 60;
  
  std::cout << hours << ":" << minutes << ":" << seconds << std::endl;
  return 0;
}
```

In the optimized program, the variable `is` has been renamed to `input_seconds` for clarity. The calculations for hours, minutes, and seconds have been simplified by using the modulus operator (`%`) to get the remaining seconds after division. The program outputs the time in the desired format and returns 0 at the end.
