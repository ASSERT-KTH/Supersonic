Explanation of optimization:

1. We can eliminate the variables `h`, `m`, and `s` because they are only used once and can be directly printed.

2. Instead of performing the calculations using the division and subtraction operations, we can use the modulo operator `%` to get the remainder and divide the time accordingly.

3. We can remove the `using namespace std;` statement and qualify the `cin`, `cout`, and `endl` statements with the `std` namespace to improve code readability and avoid potential naming conflicts.

Optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  int seconds;
  std::cin >> seconds;

  int hours = seconds / 3600;
  seconds %= 3600;

  int minutes = seconds / 60;
  seconds %= 60;

  std::cout << hours << ":" << minutes << ":" << seconds << std::endl;
  return 0;
}
```
