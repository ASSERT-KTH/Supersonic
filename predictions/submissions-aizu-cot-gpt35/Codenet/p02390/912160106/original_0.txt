Step 1: Remove unnecessary variables and calculations.

- The variable `s` is not used in the program, so it can be removed.
- Instead of calculating `is = is - h * 3600` and `is = is - m * 60`, we can directly calculate `is` using the modulo operator `%`.

Optimized program:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  int is;
  int h, m;
  cin >> is;
  h = is / 3600;
  is %= 3600;
  m = is / 60;
  is %= 60;
  cout << h << ":" << m << ":" << is << endl;
  return 0;
}
```
