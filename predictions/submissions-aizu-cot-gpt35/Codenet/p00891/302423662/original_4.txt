The given program calculates the number of occurrences of a pattern in an image. It uses nested loops to iterate through the image and pattern matrices, and checks if there is a match at each position.

To optimize this program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The program includes the entire `<bits/stdc++.h>` library, which is not necessary for this program. We can remove this line and include only the necessary headers.

2. Remove unnecessary global variables: The program declares several global variables that are not used outside of the main function. We can move these variables into the main function to improve readability and reduce the scope of these variables.

3. Use local variables instead of global variables: The program uses global variables `im`, `pa`, and `used` to store the image, pattern, and used patterns. These variables can be declared as local variables within the main function, reducing the scope and potential conflicts.

4. Optimize the pattern matching algorithm: The current algorithm checks for pattern matches by iterating through the image and pattern matrices multiple times. We can optimize this algorithm by using a rolling hash technique, which allows us to calculate the hash of a submatrix in constant time. This eliminates the need for nested loops and reduces the time complexity of the algorithm.

5. Optimize the pattern rotation and reflection: The program rotates and reflects the pattern matrix four times to check for all possible rotations and reflections. Instead of rotating and reflecting the matrix multiple times, we can calculate the hash of all possible rotations and reflections of the pattern matrix in advance and store them in a set. Then, we can simply check if the hash of the current submatrix exists in the set, which reduces the number of calculations and comparisons.

6. Use more efficient data structures: The program uses a vector to store the used patterns. Instead of a vector, we can use an unordered_set to store the used patterns, which provides faster lookup and insertion.

7. Improve variable naming and code readability: The program uses variable names like `im`, `pa`, `w`, `h`, `p`, `ans`, which are not very descriptive. We can improve the variable names to make the code more readable and self-explanatory.

Here is the optimized version of the program:

1. Removed unnecessary includes: The unnecessary `bits/stdc++.h` include has been removed and only the necessary headers have been included.

2. Removed unnecessary global variables: The global variables `im`, `pa`, `w`, `h`, `p`, and `ans` have been moved into the main function.

3. Used local variables instead of global variables: The variables `image`, `pattern`, `used`, and `roll` have been declared as local variables within the main function.

4. Optimized the pattern matching algorithm: The program now uses a rolling hash technique to calculate the hash of a submatrix in constant time. This eliminates the need for nested loops and reduces the time complexity of the algorithm.
