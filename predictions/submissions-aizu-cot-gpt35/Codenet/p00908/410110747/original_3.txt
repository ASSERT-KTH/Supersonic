To optimize the given program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The program includes the entire `<bits/stdc++.h>` library, which is not necessary. We can remove this line and only include the necessary headers.

2. Remove unnecessary variables: The variable `ans` is initialized with -1 and is only used to store the final result. We can remove this variable and directly print the result when it is found.

3. Use a fixed-size array instead of a vector for the `memo` variable: The `memo` variable is a 2D vector that is used as a memoization table. Since the size of the table is fixed, we can use a fixed-size array instead of a vector to improve memory usage.

4. Use a fixed-size array instead of a vector for the `field` variable: The `field` variable is a 2D vector that represents the game field. Since the size of the field is fixed, we can use a fixed-size array instead of a vector to improve memory usage.

5. Use a fixed-size array instead of a priority_queue for the `que` variable: The `que` variable is a priority queue that is used to store the possible moves. Since the maximum size of the queue is known (60 * 60 * 4), we can use a fixed-size array instead of a priority queue to improve memory usage.

6. Use a fixed-size array instead of a vector for the `ox` and `oy` variables: The `ox` and `oy` variables are used to store the positions of the 'o' cells. Since the maximum number of 'o' cells is known (2), we can use a fixed-size array instead of a vector to improve memory usage.

7. Use a fixed-size array instead of a vector for the `dx`, `dy`, `dx2`, and `dy2` variables: The `dx`, `dy`, `dx2`, and `dy2` variables are fixed-size arrays that represent the possible moves. We can declare them as fixed-size arrays instead of vectors to improve memory usage.

8. Use a fixed-size array instead of a vector for the `atop` variable: The `atop` variable is a struct that is used to store the current position and turn. Since the size of the struct is fixed, we can use a fixed-size array instead of a vector to improve memory usage.

9. Use a fixed-size array instead of a vector for the `field` variable in the `getdis` function: The `field` variable in the `getdis` function is a 2D vector that represents the game field. Since the size of the field is fixed, we can use a fixed-size array instead of a vector to improve memory usage.

10. Remove unnecessary checks in the `getdis` function: The `getdis` function checks if the next position is valid before pushing it into the queue. However, this check is unnecessary because the positions outside the field are already marked as true in the `field` variable.

11. Use a fixed-size array instead of a vector for the `que` variable in the `getdis` function: The `que` variable in the `getdis` function is a queue that is used to store the possible moves. Since the maximum size of the queue is known (60 * 60), we can use a fixed-size array instead of a vector to improve memory usage.

12. Remove unnecessary checks in the `main` function: The `main` function initializes the `memo2` variable with a large value (999999), which is unnecessary because the `memo2` array is already initialized with this value in the previous loop.

13. Use a fixed-size array instead of a vector for the `atop` variable in the `main` function: The `atop` variable is a struct that is used to store the current position, way, and turn. Since the size of the struct is fixed, we can use a fixed-size array instead of a vector to improve memory usage.

14. Use a fixed-size array instead of a vector for the `field` variable in the `main` function: The `field` variable in the `main` function is a 2D vector that represents the game field. Since the size of the field is fixed, we can use a fixed-size array instead of a vector to improve memory usage.

15. Use a fixed-size array instead of a priority_queue for the `que` variable in the `main` function: The `que` variable in the `main` function is a priority queue that is used to store the possible moves. Since the maximum size of the queue is known (60 * 60 * 4), we can use a fixed-size array instead of a priority queue to improve memory usage.

16. Use a fixed-size array instead of a vector for the `nkx`, `nky`, and `nway` variables in the `main` function: The `nkx`, `nky`, and `nway` variables are used to store the new position and way. Since the size of these variables is fixed, we can use a fixed-size array instead of a vector to improve memory usage.

17. Remove unnecessary checks when pushing into the `que` variable in the `main` function: The `que` variable is a priority queue that is used to store the possible moves. However, the program checks if the new turn is smaller than the current turn before pushing it into the queue, which is unnecessary because the priority queue will automatically sort the moves based on the turn.

With these optimizations in mind, here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
using namespace std;

const int dx[4] = {-1, 0, 1, 0};
const int dy[4] = {0, 1, 0, -1};
const int dx2[4] = {-1, 0, 2, 1};
const int dy2[4] = {0, 2, 1, -1};

  int memo[60][60] = {999999};
  que.push(aa{fx, fy, 0});
  while (!que.empty()) {

      if (atop.turn + 1 < memo[nexty][nextx]) {
        memo[nexty][nextx] = atop.turn + 1;
        que.push(aa{nextx, nexty, atop.turn + 1});
      }
    }
  }
  return ans;
}
