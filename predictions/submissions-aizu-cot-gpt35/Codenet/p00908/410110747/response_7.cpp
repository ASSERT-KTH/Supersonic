Optimization steps:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The program includes the entire `bits/stdc++.h` header, which is not necessary. We can include only the necessary headers for the program.

2. Use `constexpr` instead of `const` for the `dx`, `dy`, `dx2`, and `dy2` arrays: Since these arrays are constant and known at compile-time, we can use `constexpr` instead of `const` for better performance.

3. Replace `vector<vector<int>>` with a 2D array: The program uses a 2D vector to represent the field. However, using a 2D array can be more efficient in terms of memory usage and access time.

4. Use a fixed-sized stack array for the `memo2` array: Instead of using a 3D array with size [60][60][4], we can use a fixed-sized stack array with the same size. This can reduce memory usage and improve cache locality.

5. Use a fixed-sized stack array for the field array: Similar to the `memo2` array, we can use a fixed-sized stack array for the field array instead of a vector. This can further reduce memory usage and improve cache locality.

6. Use a non-recursive function instead of recursion for the `getdis` function: The `getdis` function uses recursion to calculate the shortest distance between two points. Recursion can be expensive in terms of stack usage and function call overhead. We can replace the recursive implementation with a non-recursive implementation using a queue.

7. Use a priority queue with a custom comparator instead of a custom comparison function: The program uses a priority queue with a custom comparison function. Instead, we can use a priority queue with a custom comparator class, which can be more efficient.

8. Use a fixed-sized stack array for the `que` priority queue: Instead of using a priority queue with a vector as the underlying container, we can use a fixed-sized stack array. This can reduce memory usage and improve cache locality.

9. Use a non-recursive function instead of recursion for the main algorithm: Similar to the `getdis` function, the main algorithm uses recursion for the search. We can replace the recursive implementation with a non-recursive implementation using a while loop.

10. Use an array instead of priority queue for memoization: Instead of using a priority queue for memoization, we can use a simple array. This can be more efficient in terms of both time and memory.
