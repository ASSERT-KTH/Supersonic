The given program is using a Segment Tree data structure to solve a range query problem. The program takes an input array P of size M and performs range updates on the segment tree based on the pairs of elements in P. Then it performs a query operation on the segment tree for each element in the range [0, N-1] and calculates the result based on the query results.

To optimize the program for running time and memory usage, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The program includes the entire bits/stdc++.h header, which is not necessary and can be replaced with the required headers for input/output.

2. Use reserved space for the segment tree: The segment tree is currently initialized with a larger size than required. We can optimize the memory usage by initializing the segment tree with the exact size needed for N.

3. Optimize the segment tree update operation: The current update implementation recursively updates the segment tree nodes. We can optimize this operation by using an iterative approach instead of a recursive one. This will reduce the function call overhead and improve the running time.

4. Optimize the segment tree query operation: Similar to the update operation, the query operation can also be optimized by using an iterative approach instead of a recursive one.

5. Use scanf and printf for input/output: The program currently uses cin and cout for input/output, which can be slower compared to scanf and printf for large inputs and outputs. We can modify the program to use scanf and printf instead.

Here is the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

struct SegmentTree {
  vector<int> seg, add;
  int sz;

  SegmentTree(int n) {
    sz = 1;
    while (sz < n)
      sz *= 2;
    seg.assign(sz * 2 + 1, 0);
    add.assign(sz * 2 + 1, 0);
  }

  void Add(int a, int b, int x) {
    a += sz;
    b += sz;
    while (a < b) {
      if (a % 2 == 1) {
        add[a] += x;
        seg[a] += x;
        a++;
      }
      if (b % 2 == 1) {
        b--;
        add[b] += x;
        seg[b] += x;
      }
      a /= 2;
      b /= 2;
    }
  }

  int Query(int a, int b) {
    a += sz;
    b += sz;
    int res = 0;
    while (a < b) {
      if (a % 2 == 1) {
        res += seg[a] + add[a];
        a++;
      }
      if (b % 2 == 1) {
        b--;
        res += seg[b] + add[b];
      }
      a /= 2;
      b /= 2;
    }
    return res;
  }
};

int main() {
  int N, M, P[100000];
  scanf("%d %d", &N, &M);
  SegmentTree segtree(N);
  for (int i = 0; i < M; i++) {
    scanf("%d", &P[i]);
    --P[i];
  }
  for (int i = 1; i < M; i++) {
    int u = min(P[i - 1], P[i]), v = max(P[i - 1], P[i]);
    segtree.Add(u, v, 1);
  }
  long long ret = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < N - 1; i++) {
    long long used = segtree.Query(i, i + 1);
    int A, B, C;
    scanf("%d %d %d", &A, &B, &C);
    ret += min(used * A, C + used * B);
  }
  printf("%lld\n", ret);
}
```

Explanation of optimizations:

1. Removed unnecessary includes: Removed the <bits/stdc++.h> include and added the required includes for input/output.

2. Used reserved space for the segment tree: Changed the initialization of the segment tree to use the exact size needed for N instead of a larger size.

3. Optimized the segment tree update operation: Replaced the recursive Add function with an iterative approach using a while loop. This reduces the function call overhead and improves the running time.

4. Optimized the segment tree query operation: Replaced the recursive Query function with an iterative approach using a while loop. This reduces the function call overhead and improves the running time.

5. Used scanf and printf for input/output: Replaced cin and cout with scanf and printf for input/output operations. This can improve the running time for large inputs and outputs.
