The given C program reads a string `s` and an integer `m` from input, and then performs the following steps:

1. Calculate the length of the string `s` using `strlen`.
2. Read `m` integers from input and store them in `h`, incrementing `t` by the value of each integer.
3. Print the characters of `s` in a circular manner, starting from the index `(t + i) % a`, where `a` is the length of `s`.

To optimize this program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary variables: The variables `a` and `t` are unnecessary. We can directly use the length of `s` and the sum of `h` values instead.

2. Avoid repeated calculations: In each iteration of the outer loop, the length of `s` is calculated using `strlen` again. We can calculate it once before the loop and reuse the value.

3. Avoid unnecessary string concatenation: Instead of concatenating individual characters of `s` using `printf`, we can directly print each character using `putchar`.

4. Avoid unnecessary memory allocation: The size of the string `s` is fixed at 201 characters. We can declare it as a fixed-size array instead of dynamically allocating memory using `malloc`.

Here's the optimized C program:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  char s[201];
  int m, len, i, h, sum;

  while (scanf("%s %d", s, &m) == 2 && s[0] != '-') {
    len = strlen(s);
    sum = 0;

    for (i = 0; i < m; i++) {
      scanf("%d", &h);
      sum += h;
    }

    for (i = 0; i < len; i++) {
      putchar(s[(sum + i) % len]);
    }

    putchar('\n');
  }

  return 0;
}
```
