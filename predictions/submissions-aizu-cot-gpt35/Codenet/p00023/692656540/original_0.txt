The program calculates the distance between two points (xa, ya) and (xb, yb) using the distance formula. It then compares this distance to the sum and differences of two radii.

To optimize the program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Use `pow` function only once: The program currently uses the `pow` function twice to calculate the square of the differences in x and y coordinates. We can optimize this by calculating the square of the differences only once and storing it in a variable.

2. Use `fabs` function instead of `if-else` conditions: Instead of using multiple `if-else` conditions to determine the value of `ans[k - 1]`, we can use the `fabs` function to find the absolute value of the differences. This will simplify the logic and make the code more efficient.

3. Use a fixed-size array instead of a variable-length array: The program currently uses a variable-length array `ans[n]` to store the results. We can optimize this by using a fixed-size array instead, as the value of `n` is known at compile time.

With these optimizations, here is the optimized program:

```c
#include <float.h>
#include <math.h>
#include <stdio.h>

#define MAX_N 10000

int main(void) {
  int k, n;
  double xa, ya, ra, xb, yb, rb;
  double d[4];
  scanf("%d", &n);
  int ans[MAX_N];
  for (k = 1; k <= n; k++) {
    scanf("%lf %lf %lf %lf %lf %lf", &xa, &ya, &ra, &xb, &yb, &rb);
    double dx = xb - xa;
    double dy = yb - ya;
    double distance_squared = dx * dx + dy * dy;
    d[0] = sqrt(distance_squared);
    d[1] = ra + rb;
    d[2] = ra - rb;
    d[3] = rb - ra;
    ans[k - 1] = (fabs(d[2]) > d[0]) ? 2 : (fabs(d[3]) > d[0]) ? -2 : (d[0] > d[1]) ? 0 : 1;
  }
  for (k = 1; k <= n; k++) {
    printf("%d\n", ans[k - 1]);
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Explanation of optimizations:

1. We calculate the square of the differences in x and y coordinates only once using `dx * dx` and `dy * dy` respectively. This eliminates the need to call the `pow` function twice.

2. We use the `fabs` function to find the absolute value of the differences `d[2]` and `d[3]`. We use nested ternary conditional operators to determine the value of `ans[k - 1]` in a more concise and efficient way.

3. We define a constant `MAX_N` to represent the maximum size of the `ans` array. This allows us to use a fixed-size array instead of a variable-length array, which can be more efficient in terms of memory usage.
