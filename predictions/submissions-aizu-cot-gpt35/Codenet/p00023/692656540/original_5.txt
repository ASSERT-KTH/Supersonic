The given program calculates the distances between two points and determines the relationship between two circles based on those distances. The optimization can be done by avoiding unnecessary calculations and avoiding unnecessary memory allocation.

Here are the steps to optimize the program:

1. Remove unnecessary header files: The program includes `<float.h>` and `<math.h>`, but they are not used in the program. So, we can remove these header files.

2. Avoid unnecessary calculations: The program calculates `pow(xb - xa, 2.0)` and `pow(yb - ya, 2.0)` to calculate the distance between two points. However, we can avoid using `pow` function and calculate the square of the differences directly.

3. Avoid unnecessary memory allocation: The program allocates an array `ans` of size `n`, where `n` is taken from user input. However, this array is not required. We can simply print the result directly without storing it in an array.

Here is the optimized program:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
  int k, n;
  double xa, ya, ra, xb, yb, rb;
  
  scanf("%d", &n);
  
  for (k = 1; k <= n; k++) {
    scanf("%lf %lf %lf %lf %lf %lf", &xa, &ya, &ra, &xb, &yb, &rb);
    
    double d = sqrt((xb - xa) * (xb - xa) + (yb - ya) * (yb - ya));
    
    if (d > ra + rb) {
      printf("0\n");
    } else if (ra > d + rb) {
      printf("2\n");
    } else if (rb > d + ra) {
      printf("-2\n");
    } else {
      printf("1\n");
    }
  }
  
  return 0;
}
```

The optimized program avoids unnecessary calculations and memory allocation, which should improve the running time and memory usage of the program.
