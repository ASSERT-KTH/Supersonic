Step 1: Remove unnecessary header files

The program includes the "float.h" header file, which is not needed. We can remove it to reduce unnecessary code.

Step 2: Use a more efficient loop

The program currently uses a loop from 1 to n to iterate over the input values and store the results. However, it would be more efficient to use a loop from 0 to n-1, as this avoids the need for subtracting 1 from k in the calculations.

Step 3: Optimize the calculation of distances

The program currently calculates the distance between two points using the formula `sqrt(pow(xb - xa, 2.0) + pow(yb - ya, 2.0))`. This can be optimized by removing the unnecessary `pow` function and using the squared distance instead. By avoiding the square root calculation, we can improve performance.

Step 4: Remove unnecessary array

The program uses an array `ans` to store the results for each test case. However, since we only need to print the results, we can remove this array and print the results directly in the loop.

Optimized program:

```c
#include <math.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
  int k, n;
  double xa, ya, ra, xb, yb, rb;
  scanf("%d", &n);
  
  for (k = 0; k < n; k++) {
    scanf("%lf %lf %lf %lf %lf %lf", &xa, &ya, &ra, &xb, &yb, &rb);
    double d = (xb - xa) * (xb - xa) + (yb - ya) * (yb - ya);
    double sum_r = ra + rb;
    double diff_r = ra - rb;
    double diff_rb = rb - ra;
    if (d > sum_r * sum_r) {
      printf("0\n");
    } else if (diff_r > d) {
      printf("2\n");
    } else if (diff_rb > d) {
      printf("-2\n");
    } else {
      printf("1\n");
    }
  }
  
  return 0;
}
```

Explanation:

1. The unnecessary header file `float.h` is removed.
2. The loop is modified to iterate from 0 to n-1.
3. The distance calculation is optimized by using the squared distance instead of calculating the square root.
4. The array `ans` is removed and the results are printed directly in the loop.
