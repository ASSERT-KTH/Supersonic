The given program can be optimized in the following steps:

1. Remove unnecessary header files: The program includes `<float.h>` and `<math.h>` header files, but they are not used in the program. We can remove these unnecessary header files.

2. Avoid using dynamic array: The program declares `int ans[n]` to store the answers, where `n` is read from the input. However, variable-length arrays are not supported in C++ and are not recommended in C. Instead of using a dynamic array, we can use a static array with a fixed size.

3. Remove unnecessary calculations: The program calculates `pow(xb - xa, 2.0)` and `pow(yb - ya, 2.0)` to find the distance between two points. However, using `pow` function for squaring is not necessary and can be replaced with simple multiplication.

4. Use a more efficient comparison: The program uses multiple if-else statements to determine the value of `ans[k - 1]`. We can optimize this by using a more efficient comparison technique.

5. Fix the loop indexing: The loops in the program use `k` as the loop variable, but the indexing of arrays starts from 0. We need to adjust the loop variables accordingly.

Here is the optimized program:

```c++
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
  int n;
  scanf("%d", &n);
  int ans[100]; // Assuming a maximum value of n as 100

  for (int k = 0; k < n; k++) {
    double xa, ya, ra, xb, yb, rb;
    scanf("%lf %lf %lf %lf %lf %lf", &xa, &ya, &ra, &xb, &yb, &rb);
    
    double d0 = (xb - xa) * (xb - xa) + (yb - ya) * (yb - ya);
    double d1 = ra + rb;
    double d2 = ra - rb;
    double d3 = rb - ra;

    if (d0 > d1) {
      ans[k] = 0;
    } else if (d2 > d0) {
      ans[k] = 2;
    } else if (d3 > d0) {
      ans[k] = -2;
    } else {
      ans[k] = 1;
    }
  }

  for (int k = 0; k < n; k++) {
    printf("%d\n", ans[k]);
  }

  return 0;
}
```
