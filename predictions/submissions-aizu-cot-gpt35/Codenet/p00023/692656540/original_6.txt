The given program calculates the distance between two points and determines the relationship between two circles based on their radii and the distance between their centers.

To optimize the program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The program includes `<float.h>` and `<math.h>`, but they are not used. We can remove these includes.

2. Avoid using `pow` function: The `pow` function is not necessary to calculate the square of a number. We can replace `pow(xb - xa, 2.0)` and `pow(yb - ya, 2.0)` with `(xb - xa) * (xb - xa)` and `(yb - ya) * (yb - ya)` respectively.

3. Use a fixed-size array instead of variable-length array: The program currently uses a variable-length array `int ans[n]` to store the results. This is not efficient as variable-length arrays may have significant overhead. We can use a fixed-size array instead.

4. Avoid unnecessary calculations: The program calculates `d[1] = ra + rb` even though it is not used in the final condition. We can remove this calculation to save some computation.

Here is the optimized program:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
  int k, n;
  double xa, ya, ra, xb, yb, rb;
  double d[4];
  scanf("%d", &n);
  int ans[1000];
  for (k = 1; k <= n; k++) {
    scanf("%lf %lf %lf %lf %lf %lf", &xa, &ya, &ra, &xb, &yb, &rb);
    d[0] = (xb - xa) * (xb - xa) + (yb - ya) * (yb - ya);
    d[2] = ra - rb;
    d[3] = rb - ra;
    if (d[0] > ra + rb) {
      ans[k - 1] = 0;
    } else if (d[2] > d[0]) {
      ans[k - 1] = 2;
    } else if (d[3] > d[0]) {
      ans[k - 1] = -2;
    } else {
      ans[k - 1] = 1;
    }
  }
  for (k = 1; k <= n; k++) {
    printf("%d\n", ans[k - 1]);
  }
  return 0;
}
```

In the optimized program, we have removed the unnecessary includes, avoided using the `pow` function, used a fixed-size array, and avoided unnecessary calculations. These modifications should improve the running time and memory usage of the program.
