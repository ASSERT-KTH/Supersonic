The given program calculates the distance between two points (xa, ya) and (xb, yb) and determines the relationship between two circles with radii ra and rb centered at those points.

To optimize the program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Remove unnecessary header files (`float.h`, `math.h`) since they are not used in the program.

2. Change the array `d` from having a fixed size of 4 to a fixed size of 3. This is because the last element `d[3]` is not used in any calculation or comparison.

3. Change the array `ans` from having a variable size `n` to a fixed size of 1000 (the maximum value for `n` specified in the problem). This is because variable-length arrays are not supported in standard C++.

4. Change the loop variable `k` from starting at 1 and ending at `n` to starting at 0 and ending at `n-1`. This allows us to directly access the correct indices in the `ans` array without the need for indexing adjustments.

5. Move the `printf` statement inside the first loop to avoid the need for a second loop to print the results.

Here's the optimized program:

```cpp
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
  int k, n;
  double xa, ya, ra, xb, yb, rb;
  double d[3];
  
  scanf("%d", &n);
  int ans[1000];
  
  for (k = 0; k < n; k++) {
    scanf("%lf %lf %lf %lf %lf %lf", &xa, &ya, &ra, &xb, &yb, &rb);
    
    d[0] = sqrt((xb - xa) * (xb - xa) + (yb - ya) * (yb - ya));
    d[1] = ra + rb;
    d[2] = ra - rb;
    
    if (d[0] > d[1]) {
      ans[k] = 0;
    } else if (d[2] > d[0]) {
      ans[k] = 2;
    } else {
      ans[k] = 1;
    }
    
    printf("%d\n", ans[k]);
  }
  
  return 0;
}
```

By making these optimizations, we have reduced the memory usage by removing unnecessary elements from the `d` array and fixed the size of the `ans` array. We have also improved the running time by avoiding the need for a second loop to print the results.
