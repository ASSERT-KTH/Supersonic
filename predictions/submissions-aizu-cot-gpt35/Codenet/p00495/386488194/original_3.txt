Step 1: Remove unnecessary variables and assignments
- The variables `t` and `f` are not needed in the program. We can remove them.
- The variable `m` is assigned twice unnecessarily. We can remove the first assignment and initialize `m` to `INT_MAX` instead.

Step 2: Optimize loops
- The first loop can be optimized by removing the `++i` and `c` increment from the `scanf` statement and moving them to the loop condition.
- The second loop can be optimized by initializing `u` and `t` inside the loop instead of outside. This will eliminate the need to reset these variables in each iteration.

Step 3: Improve code readability
- The code can be made more readable by using meaningful variable names and adding comments to explain the purpose of each section.

Here is the optimized program:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <limits.h>

int main() {
    int c[5004], d[5004], num_elements, x;
    int min_steps = INT_MAX;
    
    // Read input
    scanf("%d", &num_elements);
    for (int i = 0; i < num_elements; i++) {
        scanf("%d", &c[i]);
    }
    
    // Calculate minimum steps
    while (scanf("%d", &x) != EOF) {
        int u = 0;
        int t = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < num_elements; i++) {
            t = d[i];
            d[i] = (x != c[i]) ? u : t + 1;
            u = d[i] > u ? d[i] : u;
        }
        
        min_steps = (u > min_steps) ? min_steps : u;
    }
    
    // Print result
    printf("%d\n", min_steps);
    
    return 0;
}
```
