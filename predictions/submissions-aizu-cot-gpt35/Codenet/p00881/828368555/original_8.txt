Optimization Step 1: Avoid Recalculating the Same Values

The current implementation uses a map to store the results of previously calculated values. However, the implementation checks the map every time a value is needed, which adds unnecessary overhead. 

To optimize this, we can modify the implementation to store the results directly in the map before making the recursive calls. This way, we avoid recalculating the same values multiple times.

Optimization Step 2: Change Map Key from Pair to Hash

The current implementation uses a pair of vectors as the key in the map. This can be inefficient when the vectors are large or contain many elements.

To optimize this, we can change the key type from a pair of vectors to a hash. This can be achieved by combining the elements of the vectors into a single hash value. We can use a bitwise XOR operation to combine the elements.

Optimization Step 3: Use Bitwise Operations Instead of Division

The current implementation uses a division operation to calculate the size of the vector. This operation can be computationally expensive.

To optimize this, we can use bitwise operations to calculate the size of the vector. We can use the left shift operator to calculate the value of 2 raised to the power of (m - depth) instead of using the division operation.

Optimization Step 4: Use Iterators Instead of Indexing

The current implementation uses indexing to access elements in the vector. This can be inefficient when the vector is large or contains many elements.

To optimize this, we can use iterators to access the elements in the vector. This can improve performance, especially when the vector is large.

Optimization Step 5: Use References Instead of Passing by Value

The current implementation passes the vectors by value to the recursive functions. This can be inefficient, especially when the vectors are large.

To optimize this, we can pass the vectors by reference instead of by value. This way, we avoid copying the vectors every time the recursive functions are called.

Optimization Step 6: Avoid Creating Empty Vectors

The current implementation creates empty vectors in the recursive function. This can be inefficient, especially when the vectors are large.

To optimize this, we can avoid creating empty vectors by checking if the vectors are empty before creating them. We can use the empty() function to check if a vector is empty.

Optimization Step 7: Avoid Unnecessary Bitwise Operations

The current implementation performs bitwise operations unnecessarily. For example, the bitwise OR operation is performed twice in the recursive calls.

To optimize this, we can perform the bitwise OR operation once and store the result in a variable. We can then use this variable in the recursive calls.

Optimization Step 8: Avoid Using the std namespace

The current implementation uses the entire std namespace, which can lead to naming conflicts and make the code harder to read and maintain.

To optimize this, we can remove the "using namespace std;" statement and use the std:: prefix before standard library functions and types.

Optimization Step 9: Avoid Using Global Variables

The current implementation uses a global map variable to store the results. Global variables can make the code harder to understand and maintain.

To optimize this, we can move the map variable inside the main function and pass it as a parameter to the recursive function.
