Step 1: Avoid unnecessary copying of the vector `vi` in the `search` function.

In the current implementation, the `search` function takes the vector `vi` by reference, but then it creates copies of `vi` multiple times in the for loop. This can be avoided by passing `vi` as a const reference and using `const_cast` to remove the constness when necessary.

Step 2: Avoid unnecessary lookups in the `map` mp.

In the current implementation, the `map` `mp` is used to store computed results and avoid recomputing them. However, in the `search` function, there are multiple lookups in the `map` for the same key. We can avoid these repeated lookups by storing the result of the lookup in a variable and reusing it.

Step 3: Use a `vector` instead of a `map` for storing computed results.

In the current implementation, a `map` is used to store computed results. However, using a `vector` would be more efficient in terms of both time and memory. We can use a `vector` of size `(1 << n)` to store the computed results. The index of the `vector` can be calculated using the `used` variable. This will avoid the overhead of hashing and searching in the `map`.

Step 4: Use `reserve` to avoid unnecessary reallocations of the vector `a` and `b`.

In the current implementation, the vectors `a` and `b` are created inside the for loop. However, we know that the maximum size of `a` and `b` is `n`, so we can use `reserve` to avoid unnecessary reallocations of these vectors.

Below is the optimized program incorporating these optimizations:

```
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

vector<vector<int>> mp;
string qes[128];

int search(const vector<int>& vi, int depth, int used, int m, int n) {
  if (mp[used][vi.size()] != -1)
    return mp[used][vi.size()];

  if (vi.size() > (1 << (m - depth)))
    return 100;

  if (vi.size() == 1)
    return depth;

  int res = 100;

  for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
    if ((used >> i) & 1)
      continue;

    vector<int> a, b;
    a.reserve(vi.size());
    b.reserve(vi.size());

    for (int j = 0; j < vi.size(); j++) {
      if (qes[vi[j]][i] == '0')
        a.push_back(vi[j]);
      else
        b.push_back(vi[j]);
    }

    if (a.empty() || b.empty())
      continue;

    int res_a = search(a, depth + 1, used | (1 << i), m, n);
    int res_b = search(b, depth + 1, used | (1 << i), m, n);

    res = min(res, max(res_a, res_b));
  }

  mp[used][vi.size()] = res;
  return res;
}

int main() {
  int m, n;
  while (cin >> m >> n, m) {
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
      cin >> qes[i];

    mp.assign(1 << m, vector<int>(n + 1, -1));

    vector<int> vi(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
      vi[i] = i;

    cout << search(vi, 0, 0, m, n) << endl;
  }
}
```
