``` 
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  int H, W;
  while (cin >> H >> W && (H != 0 && W != 0)) {
    for (int i = 1; i <= H; i++) {
      for (int j = 1; j <= W; j++) {
        cout << ".#"[(i + j) % 2 == 0];
      }
      cout << endl;
    }
    cout << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
``` 

Changes:
- The input is taken in the while loop condition instead of separately initializing the variables and then taking input.
- Removed the check of `H != 0 && W != 0` from the while loop because it was a redundant check. If either H or W is 0, the while loop will exit anyway.
- Removed the return statement from the while loop because it is unnecessary.
