Explanation: 

1. Changed `map` to `unordered_map`: Since the order of the data was not important and we didn't need to iterate over the map in any particular order, it was better to use an unordered_map which has a faster average time complexity for insertion, deletion and search.

2. Changed `!m[i]` to `!m.count(i)`: The `count` function is a constant time operation that counts the number of elements with a given key. This is faster than the previous way of checking if the key exists in the map.

3. Used `auto` keyword for the iterator: Using `auto` keyword for the iterator type can make the code more concise and easier to read.
