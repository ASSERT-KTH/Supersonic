```
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
auto main() -> int {
  int h, w;
  for (;;) {
    std::cin >> h >> w;
    if (h == 0 && w == 0) {
      break;
    }
    std::string row(w, '#');
    for (int y = 0; y < h; ++y) {
      std::cout << row << '\n';
    }
    std::cout << '\n';
  }
  return 0;
}
``` 

Explanation: 
- We replaced `std::stringstream` with `std::string` which is more efficient.
- We created a `std::string` containing a row of `#` characters of length `w`, and simply printed this `h` times, instead of creating a new row each time.
- We removed the `std::endl` from the `std::cout` statement, which is slower than just using `\n`. 
- We removed the `algorithm` header, which was unused in the code.
