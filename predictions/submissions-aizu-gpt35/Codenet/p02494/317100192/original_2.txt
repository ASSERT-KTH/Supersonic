```
#include <iostream>
auto main() -> int {
  int h, w;
  for (;;) {
    std::cin >> h >> w;
    if (h == 0 && w == 0) {
      break;
    }
    for (int y = 0; y < h; ++y) {
      for (int x = 0; x < w; ++x) {
        std::cout << '#';
      }
      std::cout << '\n';
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
``` 

Explanation: The original code was using stringstream to create the string of '#' characters and then outputting the string using cout. This was adding unnecessary overhead in both time and memory usage. Instead, the optimized code directly outputs the '#' characters using cout, which is faster and uses less memory.
