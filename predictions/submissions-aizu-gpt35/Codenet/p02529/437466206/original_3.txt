```
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
  int i, k, n, q, t, C = 0, S[100], T[100];
  scanf("%d", &n);
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    scanf("%d", &S[i]);
  }
  scanf("%d", &q);
  for (i = 0; i < q; i++) {
    scanf("%d", &T[i]);
  }
  for (i = 0; i < q; i++) {
    for (k = 0; k < n; k++) {
      if (T[i] == S[k]) {
        C++;
        break;
      }
    }
  }
  printf("%d\n", C);
  return 0;
}
```
In the original code, there was a mistake in the nested loop condition where the wrong array was used to compare values. The inner loop should use the `n` variable as its limit and compare the current element of the `T` array with all elements of the `S` array. Therefore, I switched the loops and changed the loop conditions to correctly compare the arrays, which should optimize the program's performance.
