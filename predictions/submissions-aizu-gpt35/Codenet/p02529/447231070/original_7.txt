```
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main() {
    int a, b, d = 0;
    scanf("%d", &b);

    int* c = calloc(b+1, sizeof(int));

    for (a = b; a > 0; a--) {
        int input;
        scanf("%d", &input);
        if (c[input] == 0) {
            c[input] = 1;
            d++;
        }
    }

    printf("%d\n", d);
    free(c);
    return 0;
}
``` 

Explanation:

1. Removed the use of a macro and replaced it with direct scanf function calls for clarity.

2. Re-arranged the program to avoid the use of a pre-defined array size. Instead, memory is allocated dynamically using calloc and freed at the end.

3. Changed the loop structure to count unique numbers in the input array in one pass. This takes advantage of the fact that only unique numbers contribute to the count.
