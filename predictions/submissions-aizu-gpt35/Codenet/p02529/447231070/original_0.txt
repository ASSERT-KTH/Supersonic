Explanation:
- Removed the macro and replaced it with the actual scanf statements.
- Removed the unnecessary global variables and declared them inside the main function.
- Changed the first loop to iterate from 0 to b-1 instead of using a decrementing loop.
- Replaced the array `c[999]` with a dynamically allocated array using `calloc()` to avoid potential buffer overflows.
- In the first loop, added `x-1` when setting `c[x-1] = 1` to avoid potential out-of-bounds access when `x` is equal to b.
- In the second loop, added `x-1` when accessing `c[x-1]` to avoid potential out-of-bounds access when `x` is equal to b.
- Added a call to `free()` to release the dynamically allocated memory for `c`.
