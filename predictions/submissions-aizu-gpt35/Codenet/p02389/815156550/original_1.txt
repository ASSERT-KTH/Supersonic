```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  int a, b;
  std::cin >> a >> b;
  std::cout << a * b << " " << 2 * (a + b) << "\n";
  return 0;
}
```

I combined the calculation of `a * 2` and `b * 2` into `2 * (a + b)` to reduce the number of arithmetic operations. I also removed `std::endl` and used `"\n"` instead to avoid unnecessary flushing of the output buffer. Finally, I added a `return 0;` statement for clarity.
