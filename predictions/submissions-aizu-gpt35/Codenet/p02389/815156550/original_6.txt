```
#include <iostream>
int main() {
  int a, b;
  std::cin >> a >> b;
  std::cout << (long long)a * b << " " << 2LL * (a + b) << std::endl;
}
```
Optimizations:
- Declared `a` and `b` on the same line to save space.
- Changed the data type of the product of `a` and `b` to `long long` to prevent integer overflow for large inputs.
- Changed the calculation of `a * 2 + b * 2` to `2 * (a + b)` to avoid redundant multiplication. Also used `LL` suffix to ensure the result is of type `long long`.
