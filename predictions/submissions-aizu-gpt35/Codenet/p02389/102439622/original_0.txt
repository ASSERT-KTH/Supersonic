```
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
  int a, b;
  scanf("%d %d", &a, &b);
  int area = a * b;
  int c = (a + b) * 2; // optimized perimeter calculation
  printf("%d %d\n", area, c);
}
``` 

I optimized the calculation of the perimeter by using the formula `(a + b) * 2` instead of `a * 2 + b * 2`. This reduces the number of arithmetic operations needed to calculate the perimeter, resulting in a faster and more efficient program.
