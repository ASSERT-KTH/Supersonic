```
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
  int a, b;
  scanf("%d %d", &a, &b);
  int area = a * b;
  int c = (a + b) * 2;
  printf("%d %d\n", area, c);
}
``` 

I removed the extra multiplication to calculate the perimeter of a rectangle. Instead, I used the formula (a + b) * 2 to calculate the perimeter, which is simpler and more efficient.
