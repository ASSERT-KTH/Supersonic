```c++
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
  int a, b;
  scanf("%d %d", &a, &b);
  int area = a * b;
  int c = (a + b) * 2;
  printf("%d %d\n", area, c);
}
``` 

I have optimized the program by replacing the calculation of perimeter with `(a+b)*2` instead of `a*2 + b*2`. This reduces the number of calculations from 4 to 3.
