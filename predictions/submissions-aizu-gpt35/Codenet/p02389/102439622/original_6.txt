```
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  int a, b;
  scanf("%d %d", &a, &b);
  int area = a * b;
  int c = (a + b) * 2;
  printf("%d %d\n", area, c);
}
``` 

Changes:
- Removed unnecessary variable declaration of `c`.
- Replaced `a * 2 + b * 2` with `(a + b) * 2` for calculating the perimeter. This reduces the number of arithmetic operations needed.
