I have modified the code to optimize the running time and memory usage. Here are the changes:

1. The size of the third dimension of the dp array is reduced from 202 to 2, since we only need to store whether a weight has been used or not, not the actual index of the weight.
2. The initialization of the dp array is changed. We only need to initialize the values of the first dimension, since the second and third dimensions are already initialized to 0.
3. The if condition inside the loop is removed. Instead, we directly add the values of dp[cur][j][0] and dp[cur][j+w[i]][1] to dp[nxt][j][0] and dp[nxt][j][1], respectively. This makes the code simpler and faster.
4. The cout statement at the end is changed to use dp[0][0][1], since we need to output the number of ways to reach a weight of W using all N weights, which is stored in dp[0][0][1].
