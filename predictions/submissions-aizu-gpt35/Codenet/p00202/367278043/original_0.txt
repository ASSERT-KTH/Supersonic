Optimizations:
- Changed the size of the array `a` to a constexpr.
- Changed the size of the array `dp` and `prime` to MAXX+1.
- Changed the initialization of the array `prime` to set both `prime[0]` and `prime[1]` to true at the beginning, since these are not prime numbers.
- Changed the initialization of the array `prime` to only set odd numbers as potentially prime, since even numbers (except 2) are not prime.
- Changed the loop condition of the sieve to `i * i <= MAXX` to avoid computing the multiples of primes that are greater than `sqrt(MAXX)`.
- Changed the loop variable `j` in the sieve to start from `i * i` instead of `2 * i`, since all smaller multiples of `i` would have already been marked as composite by previous primes.
- Changed the loop that fills the array `dp` to start from `0` instead of `1`, to avoid accessing an out-of-bounds index.
- Changed the loop that fills the array `dp` to use the `|=` operator instead of the `||` operator, to avoid unnecessary branching and improve performance.
- Removed the condition `i >= a[j]` from the loop that fills the array `dp`, since `a` is sorted and we can break out of the loop as soon as `a[j]` becomes greater than `i`.
- Changed the loop that finds the largest non-prime number in `dp` to start from `x` instead of `x-1`, to avoid accessing an out-of-bounds index.
- Changed the loop that finds the largest non-prime number in `dp` to use the prefix decrement operator to decrement the loop variable, to avoid an unnecessary comparison with `0`.
- Changed the loop that finds the largest non-prime number in `dp` to break out of the loop as soon as a non-prime number is found, to improve performance.
