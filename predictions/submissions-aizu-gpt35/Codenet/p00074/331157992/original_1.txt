```
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int h, m, s, t;
    while (scanf("%d%d%d", &h, &m, &s) == 3) {
        t = (120 - h * 60 - m) * 60 - s;
        for (int i = 0; i < 2; i++, t *= 3)
            printf("%02d:%02d:%02d\n", t / 3600, t / 60 % 60, t % 60);
    }
    return 0;
}
```
Optimizations:
- Added return type and declared variables at the beginning of the function.
- Changed `* -~h` in the for loop to `== 3` in the while loop for better readability.
- Replaced the outer loop with a while loop to allow for multiple inputs.
- Changed the inner for loop to a regular for loop with a loop counter variable for better readability.
- Removed unnecessary computation of `h` in the inner loop.
