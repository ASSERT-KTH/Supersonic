```
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  int h, m, s, t;
  while (scanf("%d%d%d", &h, &m, &s) == 3) {
    t = (120 - h * 60 - m) * 60 - s;
    for (int i = 0; i < 2; i++) {
      printf("%02d:%02d:%02d\n", t / 3600, t / 60 % 60, t % 60);
      t *= 3;
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```

I made the following changes:
- Added return type and removed the parameters from main()
- Changed the condition for the while loop to use the return value of scanf() to ensure that all three inputs are successfully read
- Added a loop variable for the inner loop and used it to iterate twice instead of decrementing `h`
- Removed the `-~` operator and used a multiplication by 3 instead
