```
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  int h, m, s, t;
  while (scanf("%d%d%d", &h, &m, &s) == 3) {
    t = (120 - h * 60 - m) * 60 - s;
    for (int i = 0; i < 2; i++, t *= 3) {
      printf("%02d:%02d:%02d\n", t / 3600, t / 60 % 60, t % 60);
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
``` 

Changes made:
- Defined all variables with their types in the beginning of the main function.
- Changed the outer while loop to check for the return value of scanf instead of its product with -~h.
- Used a for loop instead of a while loop where the counter variable is explicitly defined.
- Removed the redundant computation of (t *= 3) from the outer for loop condition and placed it in the loop body instead.
