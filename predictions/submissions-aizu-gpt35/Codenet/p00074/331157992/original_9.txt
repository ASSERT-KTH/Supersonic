```
int main() {
  int h, m, s, t;
  while (scanf("%d%d%d", &h, &m, &s) == 3) {
    t = (120 - h * 60 - m) * 60 - s;
    for (int i = 0; i < 2; i++, t *= 3)
      printf("%02d:%02d:%02d\n", t / 3600, t / 60 % 60, t % 60);
  }
  return 0;
}
```
Changes made:
- Declared all the variables before using them in the program.
- Replaced the outer `for` loop with a `while` loop and checked the return value of `scanf` to ensure all three inputs were read successfully.
- Used a separate variable `i` to iterate over the inner loop instead of decreasing `h` and multiplying `t` by 3 in the loop condition.
