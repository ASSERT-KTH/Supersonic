Optimizations Made:
- The preprocessor definition of `f` and `s` can be replaced with `typedef` to improve code readability.
- The `dp` array was declared with a size of `3000` but was accessed with an index of `3000` which causes undefined behavior. As a result, the size of the `dp` array was increased to `3001`. 
- Since we are only storing boolean values in the `dp` array, we can use the `bool` data type instead of `int` to save memory.
- The nested loops for populating the `dp` array were interchanged to loop over `D` first to take advantage of the short-circuiting property of the `&&` operator, which can improve performance.
- The `dp` array was initialized with `true` instead of having an empty constructor and manually setting `dp[0] = true`.
- The variable `d` was declared outside the loop, since it's not necessary to recompute it every iteration.
- The increment operator was changed to `+=` for the `sumf` and `sums` variables for better readability.
