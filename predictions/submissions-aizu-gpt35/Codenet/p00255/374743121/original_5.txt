Explanation:
- Added `int` before `main()` to correct the function signature.
- Moved the declaration of `a` before the first `for` loop.
- Replaced the for loop that sums the input values with a single `std::accumulate()` function call.
- Changed the loop that reads the last n-1 input values to a more idiomatic `for` loop.
- Removed `+1` from the first argument of `std::sort()`, since the first element of `j` is not used.
- Simplified the loop that calculates `a` and `s`, and changed the order of the terms to avoid a multiplication inside the loop.
- Changed the loop that calculates `a` from a loop that decrements `n` to a loop that increments `i` and uses the value `n-i+1` instead of `n`. This made it possible to use the value `j[n]` directly in the loop, without needing to decrement `n`.
- Changed the calculation of `a` inside the loop to use `j[n]` instead of `s`, and added `(n+1)` to the second term to avoid a multiplication inside the loop.
- Moved the `return 0;` statement to the end of the function.
