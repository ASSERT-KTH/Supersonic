Explanation:
- Replaced the `main()` function signature with `int main()`
- Increased the size of `j` array to `100000` to avoid potential segmentation faults
- Replaced the `if (!n)` condition with `if (n == 0)` for better readability
- Calculated the sum of all elements of the array in the same loop where the elements are being inputted
- Changed the second loop for inputting `j` array to a more readable syntax
- Calculated the sum `s` of all elements of the array outside of the final loop
- Changed the final loop to iterate from `n - 1` to `0`
- Removed the unnecessary variable `a` initialization
- Calculated the sum `s` in each iteration of the final loop by subtracting the value of `j[i + 1]` from `s`
- Calculated the maximum value of `a` in each iteration of the final loop by multiplying `(i + 1)` with the updated value of `s` and taking the maximum value between the current value of `a` and the new value
