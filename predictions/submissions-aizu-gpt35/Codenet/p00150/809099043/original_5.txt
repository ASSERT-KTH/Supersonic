Changes Made:
- In the `isprime1` function, added a condition to check if the input number is less than or equal to 1 then return 0 as it is not a prime number.
- Added a condition to check if the number is 2 then return 1 as it is a prime number.
- Added a condition to check if the number is even then return 0 as it is not a prime number.
- In the `isprime1` function, changed the loop increment to `i+=2` to skip even numbers as they are already checked.
- In the `main` function, removed the unnecessary `if` condition to check for `n==0` inside the `while` loop.
- Moved the `printf` statement inside the `if` condition where the required prime numbers are found.
- Reordered the `scanf` statement to the end of the `while` loop.
