- The program has been modified to include the standard library `stdbool.h` for using the `bool` data type.
- The function `isprime1` has been optimized to reduce the number of iterations by only checking upto `i*i <= n` instead of `i<n`.
- A check has been added in the `isprime1` function to return `false` if the number is less than or equal to 1.
- The `while` loop has been changed to check for `n!=0` instead of using an infinite loop and breaking out of it.
- The loop counter in the second `for` loop has been changed from `n` to `i`.
- The `if` statement in the second `for` loop has been simplified by directly using the boolean values returned by the `isprime1` function.
