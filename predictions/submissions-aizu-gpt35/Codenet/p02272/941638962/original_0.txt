The original program had two issues that were fixed:
1. It was using a static array of size 500000 for the input array `S` which could cause a stack overflow for large values of `n`. I replaced it with a dynamically allocated array using `malloc`.
2. The `count` variable was a global variable which is not recommended. I passed it as a pointer to the `mergesort` and `merge` functions and updated its value inside the `merge` function.
