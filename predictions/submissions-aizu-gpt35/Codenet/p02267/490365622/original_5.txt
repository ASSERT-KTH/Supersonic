      if (T[i] == S[j]) {

I have made some changes in the original code:

- I have defined `MAX_N` and `MAX_Q` constants to avoid magic numbers in the code.
- I have declared two pointers `S` and `T` that will be allocated dynamically using `malloc()`. This will allow us to allocate the exact amount of memory that the program needs to run.
- I have replaced the fixed-size arrays with dynamic arrays using `malloc()`.
- I have added `free()` statements to deallocate the memory allocated with `malloc()`.

These changes will reduce the memory usage of the program and make it more efficient.
