Explanation:
- We initialize a boolean array `found` of size `10001` and initialize all its values to `false`. This array will be used to keep track of whether a number in `T` is found in `S`.
- While scanning the array `S`, we mark each element as found in `found` array.
- In the third loop, we check if `T[i]` is found in `found` array. If it is found, we increment the counter `cnt`.
- This way, we only need to loop through `S` once and then can directly check for each element in `T` whether it is present in `S` or not.
