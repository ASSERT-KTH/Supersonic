Changes Made:
- Replaced `while(1)` with `while(std::cin >> n && n != 0)`
- Removed unnecessary initialization of `vec` variable
- Removed the else block inside the while loop as it is redundant
- Removed the initialization of `std::vector` with size as it is not needed
- Replaced `if (n == 0)` with `while(std::cin >> n && n != 0)` in the first loop
- Removed unnecessary initialization of `a` and `b` inside the while loop
- Removed unnecessary else block inside the for loop
