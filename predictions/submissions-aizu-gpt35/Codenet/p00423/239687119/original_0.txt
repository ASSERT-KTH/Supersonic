I changed the `while(1)` loop to `while(std::cin >> n && n != 0)` loop to avoid the usage of a break statement. I also added an `else` block to the if statement that checks if the first team has a higher score than the second team. Finally, I added an `else` block to the if statement that checks if the second team has a higher score than the first team.
