Explanation: 

1. Instead of `while(1)`, we can use `while(std::cin >> n && n != 0)` to check for the end of input.
2. In the `if-else` loop, we can add `game_b` to the score of the player who wins the game and add both scores to the other player. This eliminates the need for the redundant `if (game_a == game_b)` condition.
3. We can remove the `vec` variable as it is not being used.
