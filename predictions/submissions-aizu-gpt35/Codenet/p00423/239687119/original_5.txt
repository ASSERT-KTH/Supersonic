Changes Made:
- Replaced "while(1)" with "while(std::cin >> n && n != 0)" to avoid infinite loop.
- Removed the unnecessary "vec" variable.
- Removed the else statement after "if (n == 0)".
- Removed the unnecessary initialization of "a" and "b" to 0 before the loop.
- Replaced "std::cin >> n;" with "while (std::cin >> n && n != 0)" in the while loop to avoid an extra if condition.
- Removed the unnecessary initialization of "a" and "b" to 0 after the loop.
