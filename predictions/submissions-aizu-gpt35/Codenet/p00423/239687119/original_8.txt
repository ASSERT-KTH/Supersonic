Explanation:

1. Instead of using a while loop with a break statement, we can use a while loop with the condition `std::cin >> n && n != 0`. This will read input until `n` is zero, at which point the loop will terminate.

2. Instead of initializing `veca` and `vecb` with a size of zero and pushing back elements, we can initialize them with a size of one and modify their last elements. This avoids unnecessary memory reallocations.

3. We can avoid using the variables `a` and `b` by modifying the last elements of `veca` and `vecb` directly.

4. In the if-else statement, we can avoid adding `game_a` and `game_b` twice by subtracting the smaller value from the larger value and adding the result to the larger value.

5. We can remove the variable `vec` as it is not used.
