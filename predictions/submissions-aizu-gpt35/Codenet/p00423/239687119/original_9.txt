Changes made:
- Moved the variable declarations inside the loop to limit their scope and avoid unnecessary memory usage.
- Replaced the infinite loop with a loop that reads input from standard input and checks if the input is 0 to exit the loop.
- Moved the vector declarations outside the loop to avoid reallocating memory for the vectors every iteration.
- Moved the input reading for each game inside the loop.
- Removed the else statement after the if statement that checks if the input is 0 to exit the loop.
