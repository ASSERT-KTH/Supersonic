Explanation:
- The use of `bits/stdc++.h` is not recommended, as it includes all the standard library headers, which can slow down compilation time.
- `set<int>` is a container that automatically sorts its elements and removes duplicates. However, in this code, there are no duplicates and sorting is not necessary. We can use `bitset` instead, which is a fixed-size container that stores bits (0 or 1) efficiently.
- We can also use `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false)` to unsynchronize the input and output streams with the C standard streams, which can speed up input/output operations.
- By subtracting 1 from `n` before setting the corresponding bit in `data`, we can use 0-based indexing, which is more natural for `bitset`.
- The loop condition in the second loop should be `i < 30`, not `i <= 30`, to avoid printing 31 at the end.
- Instead of using `count` to check if an element is in the set, we can use `test` to check if the corresponding bit is set in `bitset`.
- We can also add `return 0` at the end of `main` to make the code more complete.
