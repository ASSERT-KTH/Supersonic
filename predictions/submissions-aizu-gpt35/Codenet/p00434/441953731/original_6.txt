```
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  bool data[31] = {false};
  int n;
  for (int i = 0; i < 28; i++) {
    cin >> n;
    data[n] = true;
  }
  for (int i = 1; i <= 30; i++) {
    if (!data[i])
      cout << i << endl;
  }
}
```


Explanation: 
1. Instead of using a set, we can use a boolean array of size 31 to keep track of the numbers that are entered. Since the numbers are between 1 to 30, we need an array of size 31 to include 30.
2. We initialize the array to false, indicating that none of the numbers have been entered yet.
3. Instead of inserting values into the set, we set the corresponding index in the boolean array to true.
4. We iterate through the array of size 30 and check if the corresponding index in the boolean array is false. If it is, we print the index.
