Changes Made:
- Removed the initialization of the array `o` with 100 elements. Instead, declared it later with the size of `n`.
- Removed the initialization of string array `b` with 100 elements. Since the size of `n` is not known beforehand, we can initialize it later after taking input for `n`.
- Replaced the infinite loop with a `while(true)` loop.
- Used the pre-increment operator instead of post-increment operator in the for loop to increase the efficiency.
- Replaced the `cin` statement inside the for loop with a `cin` statement outside the for loop to reduce its execution time.
