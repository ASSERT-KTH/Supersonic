```
#include <cstdio>

int main() {
  int a, b;
  scanf("%d %d", &a, &b);
  if (a > b)
    printf("a > b\n");
  else if (a < b)
    printf("a < b\n");
  else
    printf("a == b\n");
  return 0;
}
```
Explanation: 

- Removed unnecessary headers.
- Removed unnecessary declaration of PI.
- Used `#include <cstdio>` instead of `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` which is not recommended.
- Declared variables `a` and `b` as integers instead of leaving them undeclared.
- Removed unnecessary vector header.
