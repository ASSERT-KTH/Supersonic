```
#include <cstdio>
int main() {
  int n, m;
  std::scanf("%d%d", &n, &m);
  std::printf("%d\n", n - m - 1);
  return 0;
}
```

Optimizations:
- Removed `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` as it is not a standard header file and is not recommended to be used.
- Used `std::scanf` and `std::printf` instead of `scanf` and `printf` respectively, as it is a good practice to use the namespace and avoid conflicts with other functions with the same name.
- Added `return 0` statement to explicitly indicate the successful execution of the program.
