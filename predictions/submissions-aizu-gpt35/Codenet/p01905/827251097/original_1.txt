```
#include <cstdio>

int main() {
    int n, m;
    std::scanf("%d%d", &n, &m);
    std::printf("%d\n", n - m - 1);
    return 0;
}
```
- Including the entire `bits/stdc++.h` header is not recommended as it slows down the compilation process and may cause naming conflicts.
- Use `std::` prefix for standard library functions like `scanf` and `printf`.
- Add `return 0;` to the end of `main` function for clarity.
