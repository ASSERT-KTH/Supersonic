```
#include <iostream>
int main() {
  int n, m;
  std::cin >> n >> m;
  std::cout << n - m - 1 << std::endl;
}
```

Changes made:
- Removed `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` as it is not a standard header file and may cause portability issues.
- Replaced `scanf` with `std::cin` for input and `printf` with `std::cout` for output.
- Added `std::endl` at the end of output statement for a new line.
