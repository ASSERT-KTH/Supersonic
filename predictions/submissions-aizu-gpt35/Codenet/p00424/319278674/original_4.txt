This optimized program uses `memset` to set all elements of the `t` array to 0 at the beginning of each loop iteration. In the first loop, it reads in pairs of characters and assigns the second character to an element of the `t` array based on the value of the first character. In the second loop, it reads in individual characters and outputs the corresponding value from the `t` array, or the character itself if the corresponding `t` value is 0. The program also includes error checking for the `scanf` calls, ensuring that they return the expected number of inputs.
