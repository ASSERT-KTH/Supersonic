  A.resize(n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    scanf("%d", &A[i]);
  std::sort(A.begin(), A.end());

Explanation: 

1. Instead of using a fixed-size array, we are using a dynamic vector to store the input elements. This is more efficient for large input sizes as it avoids any potential stack overflow.
2. We are using the `resize` method of the vector to allocate the required memory before storing input elements.
3. We are using the `begin` and `end` methods of the vector to sort the elements.
4. We are printing the first element of the sorted vector outside the loop as an optimization.
5. We are using a single `printf` statement to print all the elements of the vector.
