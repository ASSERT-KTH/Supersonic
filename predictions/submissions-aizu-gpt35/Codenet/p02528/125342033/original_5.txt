```c++
#include <algorithm>
#include <cstdio>
int main() {
  int n, i, f, A[1000001];
  scanf("%d", &n);
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++)
    scanf("%d", A + i);
  std::sort(A, A + n);
  for (i = f = 0; i < n; i++)
    printf(f ? " %d" : "%d", A[i]), f = 1;
  puts("");
}
```

In this case, the original code was already well-optimized and there wasn't much to improve. However, removing the unnecessary parentheses on line 7 and placing the scanf call outside of the loop on line 5 may marginally improve performance.
