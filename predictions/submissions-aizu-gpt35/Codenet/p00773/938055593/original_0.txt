```
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int x, y, s;
  while (cin >> x >> y >> s && (x || y || s)) {
    int maxi = 0, i = 0, a = 1, b;
    while (a < s) {
      b = (s - (int)((a * (100 + x)) / 100.0) + 1) / ((100 + x) / 100.0);
      if (((int)((a * (100 + x)) / 100.0) + (int)((b * (100 + x)) / 100.0)) ==
              s &&
          b != 0) {
        maxi = max(maxi, (int)((a * (100 + y)) / 100.0) +
                             (int)((b * (100 + y)) / 100.0));
        i++;
      }
      a++;
    }
    cout << maxi << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```

I removed the unnecessary `#include <algorithm>` and `#include <vector>` since they were not used in the program. I also removed the `vector<vector<int>> tax(1000, vector<int>(2))` since it was not needed and was causing unnecessary memory allocation.
