Explanation: 

We replaced `complex` with a double variable to calculate the cross product.
We replaced `if (k.imag() == 0)` with `if (k == 0)` and `if (k.real() == 0)` with `if (abs(k) < 1e-9)`. This is because we only need to check if the cross product is zero or very close to zero (within a small epsilon value), not its real and imaginary parts separately.
We removed the `bits/stdc++.h` header and added individual headers for the required functions.
