Explanation:

The original program uses an additional loop to iterate over the range of `n-c[i]`. This is not necessary, as we can simply start iterating from `c[i]` to `n`, and this will cover all possible values of `j` that we need.

Additionally, we can swap the order of the `min` calculation to avoid using `mini[j+c[i]]` as part of the calculation, which can lead to incorrect results due to the "update in place" nature of the calculation. By using `mini[j-c[i]]` instead, we avoid this potential issue.

Finally, we can remove the `math.h` header, as it is not used in the program.
