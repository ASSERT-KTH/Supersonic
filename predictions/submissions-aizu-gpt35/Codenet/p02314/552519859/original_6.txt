Explanation:

1. The loop for initializing the `mini` array can be replaced with `memset(mini, INF, sizeof(mini));` for a faster operation.
2. The inner loop for `mini` calculation starts from 0 and goes up to `n - c[i]`. This can be modified to start from `c[i]` and go up to `n`. This improves the performance since the initial `mini` array has only `mini[0]` set to 0 and all other elements are set to `INF`. Therefore, in the first iteration of the loop, the `mini[j + c[i]]` value will be updated from `INF` to `mini[j] + 1`, whereas in the previous implementation, it is updated from `INF` to `min(mini[j] + 1, mini[j + c[i]])`, which introduces an unnecessary branching operation.
3. The `min` function arguments can be switched to first subtract `c[i]` from `j` before calculating `mini[j - c[i]] + 1`. This allows the compiler to optimize the subtraction and addition operations together, which could lead to a performance improvement.
