Changes Made:

- Removed the header file `bits/stdc++.h` and included only necessary headers.
- Used `cin` and `cout` instead of `scanf` and `printf`.
- Replaced the macro for loop with a regular for loop with the correct data type.
- Used `INT_MAX` instead of a hard-coded value for initial `min_val`.
- Removed extra braces from the declaration of `A`.
- Changed the variable name `min` to `min_val` to avoid conflicts with the `min` function.
- Changed the array `A` to `freq` for better readability.
- Used prefix increment for `j` in the for loop.
- Used braces for the nested for loop for better readability.
