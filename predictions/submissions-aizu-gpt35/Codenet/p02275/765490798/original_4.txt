```c++
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  vector<int> A(n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> A[i];
  }
  sort(A.begin(), A.end());
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cout << A[i] << " ";
  }
  cout << endl;
  return 0;
}
``` 

I have replaced the counting sort algorithm with the built-in sort function in C++. Since the built-in sort function has a time complexity of O(n*log(n)), it is faster than the counting sort algorithm which has a time complexity of O(n+k). This should optimize the program's running time.
