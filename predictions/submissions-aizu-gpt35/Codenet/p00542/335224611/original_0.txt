```
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  int a, b, c, d, e, f;
  cin >> a >> b >> c >> d >> e >> f;
  int min_val = min(min(a, b), min(c, d));
  int ans = a + b + c + d - min_val + max(e, f);
  cout << ans << endl;
  return 0;
}
```
In the original code, unnecessary header `bits/stdc++.h` is used which slows down the compile time. Also, it is a bad practice to use `using namespace std` in header files. 

I have removed the unnecessary header and used only the necessary header `iostream`. 

Instead of calculating `min(min(a, b), min(c, d))` twice, I have calculated it once and stored the value in a variable `min_val` to avoid redundant calculations.

These changes do not have any effect on the output of the program, but they improve the performance and readability of the code.
