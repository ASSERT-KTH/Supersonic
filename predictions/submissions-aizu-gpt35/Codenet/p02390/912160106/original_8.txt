```
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  int is;
  int h, m, s;
  scanf("%d", &is);
  h = is / 3600;
  is %= 3600;
  m = is / 60;
  is %= 60;
  cout << h << ":" << m << ":" << is << endl;
  return 0;
}
``` 
In this optimized version, I have replaced `cin` with `scanf` and used modulo (`%`) operator instead of multiplication. This will reduce the number of operations and improve the performance of the program.
