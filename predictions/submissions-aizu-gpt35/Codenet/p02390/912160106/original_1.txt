```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int is;
  int h, m, s;
  scanf("%d", &is);
  h = is / 3600;
  is %= 3600;
  m = is / 60;
  is %= 60;
  cout << h << ":" << m << ":" << is << endl;
  return 0;
}
```
In this program, I have replaced `cin` with `scanf` to reduce the input time. Then, instead of subtracting the product of `h` and `3600` from `is`, I have used the modulus operator (`%`) to get the remainder of `is` divided by `3600`. Similarly, I have used the modulus operator to get the remainder of `is` divided by `60`.
