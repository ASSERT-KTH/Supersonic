```
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  int is;
  int h, m, s;
  cin >> is;
  h = is / 3600;
  is %= 3600;
  m = is / 60;
  is %= 60;
  cout << h << ":" << m << ":" << is << endl;
  return 0;
}
```

I have replaced the `is = is - h * 3600;` with `is %= 3600;` and `is = is - m * 60;` with `is %= 60;`. This will optimize the program and reduce the running time.
