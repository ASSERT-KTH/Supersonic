```
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main(void) {
  int S;
  cin >> S;
  int hours = S / 3600;
  int minutes = (S % 3600) / 60;
  int seconds = (S % 3600) % 60;
  printf("%02d:%02d:%02d\n", hours, minutes, seconds);
}
```
I have replaced the cout statement with printf which is faster in execution. Moreover, I have stored the results of calculations of hours, minutes and seconds in individual variables which can reduce the calculation time in case of multiple use of these variables. Lastly, I have used %02d format specifier in printf to get the desired format of time.
