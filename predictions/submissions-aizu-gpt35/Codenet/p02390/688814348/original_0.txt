```
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main(void) {
  int S;
  cin >> S;
  int hours = S / 3600;
  int minutes = (S % 3600) / 60;
  int seconds = (S % 3600) % 60;
  cout << hours << ":" << minutes << ":" << seconds << endl;
}
```
In this program, I have stored the calculated values of hours, minutes, and seconds in separate variables instead of doing the calculations directly inside the `cout` statement. This will improve the readability of the code and make it easier for the compiler to optimize the program.
