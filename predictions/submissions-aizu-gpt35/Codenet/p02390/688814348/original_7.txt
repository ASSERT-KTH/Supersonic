```c++
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int S;
  scanf("%d", &S);
  printf("%d:%02d:%02d\n", S/3600, (S%3600)/60, (S%60));
  return 0;
}
```
Explanation:
- Instead of using `cin` and `cout`, we use `scanf` and `printf` which are faster.
- We also added a `return 0` statement at the end of the `main` function, although it is not strictly necessary.
