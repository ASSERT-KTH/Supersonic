```
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main(void) {
    int S;
    cin >> S;
    int hours = S / 3600;
    S -= hours * 3600;
    int minutes = S / 60;
    S -= minutes * 60;
    cout << hours << ":" << minutes << ":" << S << endl;
    return 0;
}
``` 

Explanation: In the original code, the same expression `(S % 3600)` is used twice to calculate the minutes and seconds. By calculating the hours first and subtracting the seconds already accounted for, we avoid performing the same calculation twice.
