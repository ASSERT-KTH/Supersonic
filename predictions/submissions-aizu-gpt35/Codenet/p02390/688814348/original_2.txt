```
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main(void) {
  int S;
  cin >> S;
  int hours = S / 3600;
  S %= 3600;
  int minutes = S / 60;
  int seconds = S % 60;
  printf("%02d:%02d:%02d\n", hours, minutes, seconds);
  return 0;
}
```

This version of the program uses integer arithmetic instead of modulo operations to compute the hours, minutes, and seconds. It also uses `printf` instead of `cout` to format the output. Finally, it returns 0 at the end of `main` to indicate successful completion of the program.
