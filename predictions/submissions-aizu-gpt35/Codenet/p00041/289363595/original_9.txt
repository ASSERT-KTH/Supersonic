```
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
  int a[4];
  while (1) {
    int scanf_res = scanf("%d %d %d %d", &a[0], &a[1], &a[2], &a[3]);
    if (scanf_res != 4) {
      break;
    }
    for (int i = 0; i < 110000; ++i) {
      putchar('(');
    }
    printf("%d+%d+%d+%d\n", a[0], a[1], a[2], a[3]);
  }
}
```

Changes made:
- Replaced the `for` loop for taking input with a single `scanf` statement. This way, we avoid the overhead of the loop and the program runs faster.
- Added a check to ensure that we have exactly four inputs. If not, we break out of the loop.
- Added curly braces for the `for` loop that prints the opening brackets. This is not strictly necessary, but it makes the code more readable and less prone to errors.
- Replaced the `printf` statement for printing the sum with the newline character at the end. This way, we avoid the extra `putchar` statement and the program runs faster.
