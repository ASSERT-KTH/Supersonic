```
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
  int a[4];
  while (1) {
    if (scanf("%d%d%d%d", &a[0], &a[1], &a[2], &a[3]) != 4) {
      break;
    }
    for (int i = 0; i < 110000; ++i) {
      putchar('(');
    }
    printf("%d+%d+%d+%d\n", a[0], a[1], a[2], a[3]);
  }
}
```

Explanation: 
1. Instead of using a for loop to read integer inputs, use a single scanf statement to read all four inputs. This reduces the number of iterations required to read inputs.
2. Add a check for scanf to ensure that all four inputs have been read successfully.
3. Add braces around the for loop that prints brackets to make the code more readable.
4. Use a single printf statement to print the sum of the four inputs and add a newline character at the end.
