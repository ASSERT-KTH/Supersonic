```c++
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
  int a[4];
  while (1) {
    if(scanf("%d%d%d%d", &a[0], &a[1], &a[2], &a[3]) != 4) {
      break;
    }
    for (int i = 0; i < 110000; ++i)
      putchar('(');
    printf("%d+%d+%d+%d\n", a[0], a[1], a[2], a[3]);
  }
}
``` 

The optimized program uses a single call to `scanf()` to read all four integers in the array `a` in a single function call. Additionally, the program checks the return value of `scanf()` to ensure that all four integers were read successfully. Finally, the program removes unnecessary code by printing a newline character directly in the `printf()` call instead of calling `putchar()`.
