```
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  cout << n * n * n << '\n';
  return 0;
}
```
In this optimized program, we have added two lines of code to make input and output faster. The `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false)` and `cin.tie(NULL)` functions make cin and cout faster by turning off the synchronization of C++ streams with C streams. We have also replaced `endl` with `'\n'` to avoid unnecessary flushing of the output buffer.
