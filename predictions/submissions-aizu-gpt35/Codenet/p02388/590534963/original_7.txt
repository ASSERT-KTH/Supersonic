```
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  long long n;
  cin >> n;
  cout << n * n * n << endl;
  return 0;
}
```

In the original code, the variable `n` was declared as an integer, which can only hold values up to a certain limit. If the input value of `n` is too large, it can cause integer overflow and result in incorrect output. To avoid this issue, I have changed the data type of `n` to a `long long`, which can hold larger values.
