```
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(NULL);
    int n;
    cin >> n;
    cout << n * n * n << "\n";
    return 0;
}
``` 

Explanation: 

1. Disabling the synchronization between the C and C++ standard streams can significantly speed up input and output operations. This is achieved by setting the `sync_with_stdio` flag to `false` using `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);`.

2. Untying cin from cout can also help in reducing the time taken for input and output operations. This can be done by setting the `cin.tie` pointer to `NULL` using `cin.tie(NULL);`.

3. Using `"\n"` instead of `endl` for printing the output can also improve performance as `endl` not only prints a newline character but also flushes the output buffer, which can be an expensive operation.
