```
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  int n;
  std::cin >> n;
  std::cout << n * n * n << std::endl;
  return 0;
}
```

This program is already optimized in terms of running time and memory usage. The only change made was to remove the unnecessary `using namespace std;` line, which can potentially cause naming conflicts in larger programs.
