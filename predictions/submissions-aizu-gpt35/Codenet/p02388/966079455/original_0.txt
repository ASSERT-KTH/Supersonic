```
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  int x, y;
  std::cin >> x;
  y = x * x * x;
  std::cout << y << '\n';
  return 0;
}
```

This code is already optimized in terms of running time and memory usage. I only changed the double quotes to single quotes for the newline character to follow the C++ convention.
