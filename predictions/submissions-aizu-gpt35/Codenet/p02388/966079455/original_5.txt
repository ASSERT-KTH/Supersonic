```
#include <iostream>
int main() {
  int x, y;
  std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  std::cin.tie(NULL);
  std::cout.tie(NULL);
  std::cin >> x;
  y = x * x * x;
  std::cout << y << "\n";
  return 0;
}
``` 

I added the three lines to optimize the I/O operations by disabling the synchronization with the standard C I/O streams. This improves the performance by avoiding the overhead of synchronizing the two I/O libraries. Also, I untied the cin and cout objects from the standard input and output streams, respectively. This operation further optimizes the I/O operations of the program by avoiding the flushing of the output stream after each operation.
