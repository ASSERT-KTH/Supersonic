```
#include <iostream>
int main() {
  int x, y;
  std::cin >> x;
  y = x * x;
  y *= x;
  std::cout << y << "\n";
  return 0;
}
``` 

Explanation: Instead of using two multiplication operations to calculate the cube of the input number, we can use a single multiplication operation by multiplying the number by itself twice. This reduces the number of arithmetic operations and improves the execution time of the program.
