```
#include <stdio.h>
int main(void) {
  int x;
  scanf("%d", &x);
  int result = x * x * x;
  printf("%d\n", result);
  return 0;
}
```

In this case, I just added an intermediate variable to store the result of the computation instead of computing it directly inside the `printf` statement. This can help with readability and may also slightly improve performance since the computation is only done once instead of twice.
