```
#include <stdio.h>
int main(void) {
  int x;
  scanf("%d", &x);
  int result = x * x * x;
  printf("%d\n", result);
  return 0;
}
```

I declared a new variable to store the result of the calculation instead of performing the calculation directly in the printf statement. This can improve readability and may also improve performance since the calculation is only performed once.
