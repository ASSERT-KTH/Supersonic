```
#include <stdio.h>
int main(void) {
  int x;
  scanf("%d", &x);
  int cube = x * x * x;
  printf("%d\n", cube);
  return 0;
}
```
I have created a new variable "cube" to store the value of x raised to the power of 3. This reduces the number of arithmetic operations performed by the program, thereby improving its efficiency.
