```
#include <stdio.h>
int main(void) {
  int x;
  scanf("%d", &x);
  int cube = x * x * x;
  printf("%d\n", cube);
  return 0;
}
```

In this program, I have optimized it by storing the result of `x * x * x` in a variable called `cube` instead of computing it twice in the `printf` statement. This will improve the running time of the program.
