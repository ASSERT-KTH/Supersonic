```c++
#include <stdio.h>
int main(void) {
  long long int x;
  scanf("%lld", &x);
  printf("%lld\n", x * x * x);
  return 0;
}
```

I have changed the data type of `x` from `int` to `long long int` to prevent overflow as the cube of an integer can be a very large number. Additionally, I have changed the format specifier in `scanf()` and `printf()` to `%lld` to match the new data type of `x`.
