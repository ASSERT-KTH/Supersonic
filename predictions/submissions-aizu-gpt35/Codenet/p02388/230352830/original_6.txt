```c++
#include <stdio.h>
int main(void) {
  int x;
  scanf("%d", &x);
  int result = x * x * x;
  printf("%d\n", result);
  return 0;
}
``` 

I have added a new variable called `result` to store the result of the calculation. This is a good practice as it makes the code more readable and easier to debug.
