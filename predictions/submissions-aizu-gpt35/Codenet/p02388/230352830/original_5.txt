```
#include <stdio.h>
int main(void) {
  int x;
  scanf("%d", &x);
  int result = x * x * x;
  printf("%d\n", result);
  return 0;
}
```
I have only declared a variable to store the result of the calculation, as it is faster to access a variable than to perform the calculation again when printing the result.
