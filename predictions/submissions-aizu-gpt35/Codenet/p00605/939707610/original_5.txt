```
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  int N, K, i, j, *S, B, a;
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); //disable synchronization of iostreams with stdio
  cin.tie(NULL); //prevent flushing of cout before cin is finished
  while (a = 1, cin >> N >> K, N || K) {
    S = new int[K];
    for (i = K; i--;)
      cin >> S[i];
    for (i = 0; i < N; ++i)
      for (j = K; j--;)
        cin >> B, S[j] -= B, S[j] < 0 ? a = 0 : 0;
    cout << (a ? "Yes" : "No") << endl;
    delete [] S; //free memory allocated by new
  }
}
```

Explanation: 

1. Avoid synchronization of iostreams with stdio, which may significantly reduce the runtime.
2. Prevent flushing of cout before cin is finished, which may also reduce the runtime.
3. Free memory allocated by new to avoid memory leaks.
