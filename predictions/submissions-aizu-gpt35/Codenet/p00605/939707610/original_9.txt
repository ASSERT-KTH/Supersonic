```
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  int N, K, i, j, *S, B, a;
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  while (a = 1, cin >> N >> K, N || K) {
    S = new int[K];
    for (i = K; i--;)
      cin >> S[i];
    for (i = 0; i < N; ++i)
      for (j = K; j--;)
        cin >> B, S[j] -= B, S[j] < 0 ? a = 0 : 0;
    cout << (a ? "Yes" : "No") << endl;
    delete[] S; // free memory
  }
}
```

I added two lines to optimize the program. The first line disables the synchronization between C and C++ standard streams, which can improve performance. The second line unties cin and cout, which can also improve performance. I also added a line to free the allocated memory to avoid memory leaks.
