```
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  int N, K, i, j, B, a;
  while (a = 1, cin >> N >> K, N || K) {
    int S[K];
    for (i = K; i--;)
      cin >> S[i];
    for (i = 0; i < N; ++i)
      for (j = K; j--;)
        cin >> B, S[j] -= B, S[j] < 0 ? a = 0 : 0;
    cout << (a ? "Yes" : "No") << endl;
  }
}

```
Changes Made: 

- Replaced dynamic memory allocation with a static one
- Removed the usage of a pointer by declaring an array `S` of size `K`
- The program now uses less memory as we avoid dynamic memory allocation. 

Note:
- This program can be further optimized, but without additional information about the input constraints and problem requirements, we cannot make further optimizations.
