```
#include <cstdio>
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  double r, s, l;
  const double x = 3.141592653589;
  cin >> r;
  s = r * r * x;
  l = x * (r + r);
  printf("%.8lf %.8lf\n", s, l);
}
```

In this program, we can optimize the memory usage by removing the unnecessary variable `x` and making it a constant value instead. This will also slightly improve the program's running time since we won't have to retrieve the value of `x` from memory every time it's used.
