```
#include <cstdio>
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
const double PI = 3.141592653589;
int main() {
  double r;
  cin >> r;
  printf("%.9lf %.9lf\n", PI * r * r, 2 * PI * r);
  return 0;
}
```
I moved the constant PI to be declared outside of main to avoid re-declaring it every time the function is called. I also added a precision specifier to printf for better accuracy.
