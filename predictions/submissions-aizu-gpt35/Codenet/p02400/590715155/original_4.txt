```
#include <cstdio>
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  const double PI = 3.141592653589;
  double r;
  scanf("%lf", &r);
  printf("%.9lf %.9lf\n", PI * r * r, 2 * PI * r);
  return 0;
}
```
- Declaring the constant PI as double is a better optimization measure.
- Replacing cin with scanf can also help with performance improvements.
- Using %.9lf instead of %lf for printf can help display the output with more precision.
