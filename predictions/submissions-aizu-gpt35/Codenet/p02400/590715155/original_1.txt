```
#include <cstdio>
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  const double PI = 3.141592653589;
  double r;
  scanf("%lf", &r);
  printf("%.6lf %.6lf\n", PI * r * r, 2 * PI * r);
  return 0;
}
``` 

In this optimized program, I made the following changes:

1. Declared PI as a constant variable because it's value is constant throughout the program.
2. Changed `cin` to `scanf` because `scanf` is faster.
3. Used `%.6lf` instead of `%lf` to print the result with 6 decimal places.
