```
#include <cstdio>
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  const double PI = 3.141592653589;
  double r;
  scanf("%lf", &r);
  printf("%lf %lf\n", PI * r * r, 2 * PI * r);
  return 0;
}
```

Changes made:
- Declared PI as a constant variable as its value remains constant throughout the program.
- Used scanf instead of cin as it is faster for taking input.
- No other changes made as the program is already optimized for memory usage.
