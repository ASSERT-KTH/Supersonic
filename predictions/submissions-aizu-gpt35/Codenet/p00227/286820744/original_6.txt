Changes Made:
- Previously, a new vector was being created in each iteration of the while loop. Instead, a single vector with a fixed size is created before the while loop.
- `push_back()` method was used to add new elements to the vector, which can be avoided by assigning values to the elements using `[]` operator.
- `sort()` method was used to sort the vector in ascending order, causing the subsequent loop to access elements in reverse order. Instead, we sort the vector in descending order using `rbegin()` and `rend()` methods.
- `std::endl` was used to output a newline character and flush the output buffer, which can be replaced with `'\n'` to avoid unnecessary flushing.
