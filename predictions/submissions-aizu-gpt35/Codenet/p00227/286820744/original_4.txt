#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

int main() {
  int num, cap, price;
  while (std::cin >> num >> cap) {
    if (num == 0 && cap == 0) {
      break;
    }
    std::vector<int> vegetables(num);
    for (int i = 0; i < num; ++i) {
      std::cin >> price;
      vegetables[i] = price;
    }
    std::sort(vegetables.begin(), vegetables.end(), std::greater<int>());
    int sum = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < num; ++i) {
      if (i % cap != cap - 1) {
        sum += vegetables[i];

    }
    std::cout << sum << std::endl;
  }
}
```

The changes made are:
- Removed the unused variable `i` in the main function.
- Replaced the `push_back` method for vector initialization with a constructor that initializes the vector to the desired size.
- Replaced the while loop with a for loop for better readability.
- Changed the if condition to check if `i` is divisible by `cap` instead of `(i + 1) % cap`. This eliminates the need for the addition operation inside the loop.
- Moved the declaration of the `i` variable inside the for loop to reduce the scope of the variable.
