``` 
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  for (int i = 1; i <= 9; i++) {
    for (int j = 1; j <= 9; j++) {
      cout << i << "x" << j << "=" << i * j << "\t";
    }
    cout << endl; // moved from the inner loop to the outer loop
  }
  return 0;
}
```
The main optimization here is that we have reduced the number of output operations by printing the multiplication table for each value of i in a single line using the "\t" character to separate the products. This minimizes the number of times the output buffer is flushed, which can be expensive in terms of time and memory usage.
