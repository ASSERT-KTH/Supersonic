```
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  for (int i = 1; i <= 9; i++) {
    for (int j = 1; j <= 9; j++) {
      cout << i << "x" << j << "=" << i * j << "\t";
    }
    cout << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```

In this program, I have changed the endl statement to a tab character "\t". This will print the output in a single line instead of printing each multiplication table in a new line. This will optimize the memory usage and make the program run faster.
