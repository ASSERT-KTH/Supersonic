```c++
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  cout.tie(NULL);
  for (int i = 1; i <= 9; i++) {
    for (int j = 1; j <= 9; j++) {
      cout << i << "x" << j << "=" << i * j << "\n";
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
``` 
I have added some optimizations to your code. The `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false)` function is used to make standard input and output streams faster. The `cin.tie(NULL)` and `cout.tie(NULL)` functions are used to make cin and cout faster by breaking the tie between them. I have also changed `endl` to `"\n"`, as `endl` flushes the output buffer which can cause a delay.
