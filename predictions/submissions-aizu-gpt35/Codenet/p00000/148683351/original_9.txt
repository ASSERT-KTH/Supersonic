``` 
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  for (int i = 1; i <= 9; ++i) {
    for (int j = 1; j <= 9; ++j) {
      cout << i << "x" << j << "=" << i * j << "\n";
    }
  }
  cout << flush; // flush the output buffer
  return 0;
}
``` 

I made two changes to optimize the program:
1. Changed the post-increment operator to pre-increment in the for loops to improve performance.
2. Changed endl to "\n" to avoid flushing the output buffer every time. Instead, I added `cout << flush` at the end to manually flush the buffer. This will improve memory usage and performance.
