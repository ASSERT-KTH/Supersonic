```
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  for (int i = 1; i <= 9; ++i) {
    for (int j = 1; j <= 9; ++j) {
      cout << i << "x" << j << "=" << i * j << "\n";
    }
  }
  cout << flush;
  return 0;
}
``` 

In this optimized version, I used the pre-increment operator instead of post-increment operator for the `i` and `j` variables as it is faster. I also replaced `endl` with `"\n"` to avoid flushing the output buffer every time. Finally, I added `cout << flush` after the loops to flush the output buffer one time only.
