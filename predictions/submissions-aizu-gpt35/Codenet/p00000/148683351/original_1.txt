```
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  for (int i = 1; i <= 9; i++) {
    for (int j = 1; j <= 9; j++) {
      cout << i << "x" << j << "=" << i * j << "\n";
    }
  }
  cout << flush;
  return 0;
}
```

The only optimization made here is to replace `endl` with `"\n"`, which avoids flushing the output buffer every time a new line is printed. Additionally, `flush` is called at the end of the program to ensure that any remaining output is flushed. Flushing the output buffer frequently can be a bottleneck in programs that do a lot of printing.
