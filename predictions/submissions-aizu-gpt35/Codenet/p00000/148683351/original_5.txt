```
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  for (int i = 1; i <= 9; i++) {
    for (int j = 1; j <= 9; j++) {
      cout << i << "x" << j << "=" << i * j << "\t";
    }
    cout << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```
I have optimized the program by reducing the number of calls to the `endl` function. Instead, I have used the escape sequence `"\t"` to print a tab character which will increase the readability of the output.
