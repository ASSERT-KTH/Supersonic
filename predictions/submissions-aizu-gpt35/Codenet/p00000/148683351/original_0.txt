```c++
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); //disable synchronization between C and C++ standard streams
  cin.tie(NULL); //untie cin from cout
 
  for (int i = 1; i <= 9; i++) {
    for (int j = 1; j <= 9; j++) {
      cout << i << "x" << j << "=" << i * j << '\n'; //use '\n' instead of endl
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```
The optimized program has the following changes:
- `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false)` is added to disable synchronization between C and C++ standard streams, which can improve performance.
- `cin.tie(NULL)` is added to untie `cin` from `cout`, which can also improve performance.
- `endl` is replaced with `'\n'` to avoid unnecessary flushing of the output buffer, which can improve performance.
