```
#include <stdio.h>
int main(void) {
  int i, j;
  for (i = 1; i < 10; ++i) {
    for (j = 1; j < 10; ++j) {
      printf("%dx%d=%d\n", i, j, i * j);
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```

I have made a few minor optimizations in the code. 

1) Changed `i++` and `j++` to `++i` and `++j` respectively for slightly faster incrementation.

2) Removed unnecessary parentheses in the return statement.

These changes may not make a noticeable difference in the running time or memory usage, but they are good programming practices to follow.
