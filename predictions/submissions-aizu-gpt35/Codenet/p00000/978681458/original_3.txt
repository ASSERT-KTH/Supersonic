```
#include <stdio.h>
int main(void) {
  int i, j;
  for (i = 1; i < 10; i++) {
    for (j = 1; j < 10; j++) {
      printf("%dx%d=%d\n", i, j, i * j);
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```

There is no need for parentheses around the return value. This program is already optimized and cannot be further optimized since it only contains nested loops to print the multiplication table from 1 to 9.
