```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main(void) {
  int i, j;
  for (i = 1; i < 10; i++) {
    for (j = 1; j < 10; j++) {
      printf("%dx%d=%d\n", i, j, i * j);
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```

This program cannot be optimized any further from the perspective of time and memory usage. The nested loops are necessary to iterate through all possible combinations of `i` and `j`, and the `printf` statement is the most efficient way to print the results to the console.
