```
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  for (int i = 1; i < 10; i++) {
    for (int j = 1; j < 10; j++) {
      printf("%dx%d=%d\n", i, j, i * j);
    }

The given program is already optimized in terms of both running time and memory usage. It is a simple nested loop that prints the multiplication table from 1 to 9. Since the number of iterations is fixed and small, there is no need for any further optimization.
