```c++
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
  for (int i = 1; i < 10; i++) {
    for (int j = 1; j < 10; j++) {
      printf("%dx%d=%d\n", i, j, i * j);
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```
This program is already optimized as it is using nested loops to print the multiplication table of numbers from 1 to 9. The time complexity is O(n^2) which is the best possible time complexity for this problem. The memory usage is also minimal as the program is only using basic data types and not allocating any dynamic memory.
