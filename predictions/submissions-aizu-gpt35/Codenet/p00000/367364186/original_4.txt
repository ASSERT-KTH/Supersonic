```c++
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
  for (int i = 1; i < 10; ++i) {
    for (int j = 1; j < 10; ++j) {
      printf("%dx%d=%d\n", i, j, i * j);
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```

The only change I made was to increment the loop counters using the pre-increment operator instead of post-increment operator. This is because pre-increment operator generally leads to faster code as it avoids the creation and copying of temporary variables.
