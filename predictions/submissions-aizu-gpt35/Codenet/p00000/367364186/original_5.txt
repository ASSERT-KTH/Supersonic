```
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
  for (int i = 1; i < 10; i++) {
    for (int j = 1; j < 10; j++) {
      printf("%dx%d=%d\n", i, j, i * j);
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```
This program doesn't have much room for optimization, but you can make a small improvement by changing the loop conditions to `i <= 9` and `j <= 9` respectively. This will avoid the need for the `i < 10` and `j < 10` comparisons in every iteration of the loops, which can save a small amount of time. Here's the optimized code:

```
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
  for (int i = 1; i <= 9; i++) {
    for (int j = 1; j <= 9; j++) {
      printf("%dx%d=%d\n", i, j, i * j);
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```
