```
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    int a, b, c, i;
    scanf("%d%d", &a, &b);
    while (b != 0) {
        c = a % b;
        a = b;
        b = c;
    }
    printf("%d\n", a);
    return 0;
}
``` 

I have made the following changes:
- Initialized `c` variable to a garbage value instead of `1`.
- Changed condition of while loop from `c > 0` to `b != 0` for optimising the program with the help of Euclid's algorithm.
- Added `return 0;` statement as a good coding practice.
