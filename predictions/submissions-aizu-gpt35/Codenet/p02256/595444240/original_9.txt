```c++
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  int a, b, c = 1, i;
  cin >> a >> b;
  while (c > 0) {
    c = a % b;
    a = b;
    b = c;
  }
  cout << a << endl;
  return 0;
}
```
I have made the following changes to optimize the program:
- Used `iostream` instead of `stdio.h` and `iostream` is faster.
- Used `using namespace std` to avoid writing `std::` multiple times.
- Replaced `printf` and `scanf` with `cout` and `cin` respectively. They are faster and more modern.
- Added `return 0` to the end of the program to signify successful program execution.
