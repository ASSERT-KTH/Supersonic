    double min = 100000;
    for (int i = 0; i <= d; i++) {
      int j = d - i;
      double cost = sqrt(i * i + j * j);
      double gap = fabs(cost - e);
      if (gap < min) {

Explanation: 

1. Removed unnecessary headers
2. Removed the `using namespace std;` statement
3. Removed the `map`, `string`, and `vector` headers as they were not being used in the code
4. Changed the loop condition from `while(1)` to `while(true)` for clarity
5. Removed the initialization of `min` to `100000` outside the loop and moved it inside the loop to ensure it gets reset for each test case
6. Simplified the nested loops to calculate `j` from `d - i`
7. Removed the check for `i + j == d` as it is redundant with the calculation of `j`
8. Replaced `sqrt((cost-e)*(cost-e))` with `fabs(cost-e)` to avoid the expensive square root operation
9. Removed the `return 0;` statement as it is not required by the C++ standard
