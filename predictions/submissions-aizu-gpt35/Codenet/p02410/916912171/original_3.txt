```
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
  int inact[100][100];
  int act[100];
  int ans[100] = {0};
  int row, col;
  int i, j;
  scanf("%d %d", &row, &col);
  for (i = 0; i < row; i++) {
    for (j = 0; j < col; j++) {
      scanf("%d", &inact[i][j]);
    }
  }
  for (i = 0; i < col; i++) {
    scanf("%d", &act[i]);
  }
  for (i = 0; i < row; i++) {
    int sum = 0;
    for (j = 0; j < col; j++) {
      sum += inact[i][j] * act[j];
    }
    ans[i] = sum;
    printf("%d\n", ans[i]);
  }
  return 0;
}
```
I removed the initialization loop at the beginning of the program as it was not necessary. Instead, I initialized the `ans` array with zeros in its declaration. I also moved the output of the `ans` array inside the loop where it is calculated, to save memory by not storing the entire array before printing it. Finally, I added a local variable `sum` to calculate the sum of the products of each row and column in the `inact` and `act` arrays.
