```
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main(void) {
    int stone[50];
    for (int k = 0; k < 50; k++) {
      stone[k] = 0;
    }
    int bowl,n,p,ans;
    while (cin >> n >> p && n!=0 && p!=0) {
        bowl = p;
        for (int i = 0; ; i = (i + 1) % n) {
            if (bowl == 0) {
                bowl = bowl + stone[i];
                stone[i] = 0;
            } else {
                stone[i]++;
                bowl--;
                if (bowl == 0 && stone[i] == p) {
                    ans = i;
                    break;
                }
            }
        }
        cout << ans << endl;
    }
}
```

The main modifications are: 

1. Moved the initialization of stone array outside of the while loop to avoid unnecessary memory allocation and deallocation in every iteration of the loop.

2. Removed the unnecessary condition checking for terminating the while loop. 

3. Removed the for loop that iterates 1 million times, which was not doing anything and unnecessarily increasing the running time.
