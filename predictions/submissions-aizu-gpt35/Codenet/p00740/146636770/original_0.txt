#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int stone[50];
    for (int k = 0; k < 50; k++) {
        stone[k] = 0;
    }
    int bowl, n, p;
    while (cin >> n >> p && (n || p)) {
        bowl = p;
        bool flg = true;
        int ans, i = 0;
        while (flg) {
            if (bowl == 0) {
                bowl += stone[i];
                stone[i] = 0;
            } else {
                stone[i]++;
                bowl--;
                if (bowl == 0 && stone[i] == p) {
                    ans = i;
                    flg = false;
                }
            }
            i = (i + 1) % n;
        }
        cout << ans << endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
```

The original code had a nested loop that didn't serve any purpose and only increased the running time. Additionally, I removed the initialization of the array "stone" from inside the "while" loop since it's not necessary to reset it every iteration. Finally, I reformatted the code for better readability.
