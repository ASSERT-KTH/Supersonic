I have made the following changes to optimize the program:

- Added `stdlib.h` library for `malloc` and `free` functions.
- Moved the declaration of the `canAlloc` function before the `main` function to avoid the need for a function prototype.
- Changed the type of `i` and `track_id` from `long` to `int` as they represent array indices and loop counters, which can never exceed the maximum value of an `int`.
- Changed the type of `alloced_in_one` from `long` to `int` since it represents the weight of the packets in a track, which can never exceed the maximum value of an `int`.
- In the `canAlloc` function, reset `alloced_in_one` to `weight[i]` instead of `0` when starting a new track.
- Removed the `i--` statement in the `canAlloc` function, as it is not needed when starting a new track.
- Changed the `return` statement in the `canAlloc` function to `false` when starting a new track and the current packet cannot be added to the track.
- Changed the `return` statement in the `canAlloc` function to `true` when all packets can be allocated to the tracks.
