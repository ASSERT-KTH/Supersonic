- I replaced the `p` variable with a passed reference to the functions, since it was being used globally, which can cause problems in the future.
- I changed the `get` function to receive a reference to `a` instead of a copy, so it doesn't need to create a copy of the variable every time it is called.
- I removed the `typedef long long ll` since it is not being used.
- I removed the `using namespace std` to avoid namespace pollution.
- I removed the initial declaration of the string `S`, since it is not needed.
- I removed the `int p` declaration inside the `for` loop, as it can be declared outside and reused.
- I changed the order of the parameters passed to `get` and `calc` functions to match their order of use in the function.
