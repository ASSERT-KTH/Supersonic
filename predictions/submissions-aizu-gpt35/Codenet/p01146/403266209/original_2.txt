Changes Made:

- Removed unnecessary `#define` as they are bad practice.
- Removed `using namespace std` as it is bad practice.
- Added `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false)` and `cin.tie(NULL)` to speed up input-output operations.
- Changed variable `n` and `m` from `long long` to `int` as they are less memory-consuming.
- Removed the creation of the `set` `rei` array every iteration of the loop and instead used `clear()` to clear it.
- Changed the size of the arrays `b` and `x` from `n*n` to `205*205` to avoid stack overflow.
- Declared the `b` and `x` arrays as global variables to avoid stack overflow.
- Changed the inner loops from `r(i, n) r(j, n)` to `r(i, MAXN) r(j, MAXN)` to use the constant `MAXN`.
- Moved the `l` and `k` input loops outside of the main loop to avoid redundant iterations.
- Replaced the `if (rei.count(i))` and `if (rei.count(j))` with `if (x[i][j] != INF)` to reduce function calls.
- Removed the `endl` and replaced it with `"\n"` as it is faster.
- Added curly braces to the inner loops to improve readability.
