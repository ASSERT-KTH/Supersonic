```
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
  int a, b, c;
  scanf("%d%d%d", &a, &b, &c);
  if (a < b && b < c) {
    puts("Yes");
  } else {
    puts("No");
  }
  return 0;
}
``` 

Changes made:
1. Replaced `printf` with `puts` which is faster as it doesn't require formatting.
2. Removed the `printf("\n")` statement as `puts` already adds a newline character at the end.
