```
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
  int a, b, c;
  scanf("%d%d%d", &a, &b, &c);
  if (a < b && b < c) {
    printf("Yes\n");
  } else {
    printf("No\n");
  }
  return 0;
}

``` 

In the original code, we had an unnecessary `printf("\n");` statement which can be avoided by adding `\n` in the `printf` statement itself. Also, the `return 0;` statement can be moved up to avoid unnecessary execution of the `printf` statement.
