```
#include <stdio.h>
int main(void) {
  int a, b, c;
  scanf("%d %d %d", &a, &b, &c);
  if (a < b && b < c && a >= 0 && c <= 100) {
    printf("Yes\n");
  } else {
    printf("No\n");
  }
  return (0);
}
```
I added the condition to check if `a` is greater than or equal to 0 and `c` is less than or equal to 100, to ensure that `a`, `b`, and `c` are within the given range of 0 to 100.
