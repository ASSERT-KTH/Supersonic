```
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
    int a, b, c;
    scanf("%d %d %d", &a, &b, &c);
    if (a < b && b < c && a >= 0 && c <= 100) {
        printf("Yes\n");
    } else {
        printf("No\n");
    }
    return 0;
}
```

Explanation: 
1. The line "0 <= a, b, c <= 100;" doesn't do anything in C. It just evaluates three separate expressions (0 <= a, b, and c <= 100), but it doesn't enforce any constraints on a, b, or c. 
2. I added two additional conditions (a >= 0 and c <= 100) to ensure that a, b, and c are within the range of 0 to 100, as specified in the original non-functional line.
