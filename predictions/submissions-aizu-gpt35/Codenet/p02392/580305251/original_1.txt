```
#include <stdio.h>
int main(void) {
  int a, b, c;
  scanf("%d %d %d", &a, &b, &c);
  if (a < b && b < c && a >= 0 && c <= 100) {
    puts("Yes");
  } else {
    puts("No");
  }
  return 0;
}
``` 

I have removed the line `0 <= a, b, c <= 100;` as it doesn't do anything. Then, I have combined the `printf` statement with the `if` condition by using `puts` function. I have also added checks for `a` and `c` to be within the limits of `0` and `100` inclusive.
