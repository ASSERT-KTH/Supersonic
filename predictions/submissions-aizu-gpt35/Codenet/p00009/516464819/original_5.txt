I have made the following changes:

1. Changed `list<int>` to `vector<int>` in the `sieve` function. `vector` has better memory allocation and access speed compared to `list`.

2. Moved the `primes.push_back(2)` statement to the beginning of the `sieve` function to avoid the additional check for even numbers.

3. Combined the loop for finding primes less than or equal to the square root of `n` and for marking the multiples of primes as not prime. This reduces the number of iterations for the loop.

4. Added a separate loop for finding primes greater than the square root of `n`. This loop only needs to check odd numbers, hence the increment is changed to `2`.

5. Changed the loop for counting the number of primes to only increment the `count` variable if the current prime is equal to the input number. I also changed the condition check order to first check if the prime is greater than the input number, to avoid unnecessary iterations.
