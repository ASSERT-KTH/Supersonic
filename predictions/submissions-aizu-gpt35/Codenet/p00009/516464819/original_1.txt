Optimizations made:
- Changed the container type of `primes` from `list<int>` to `vector<int>`. Vectors have better cache locality and faster iteration times compared to lists.
- Removed the initial loop that adds all odd numbers into `v`, because the algorithm only needs to sieve the odd numbers.
- Moved the `primes.push_back(i)` statement inside the first loop, so that it's only called when we have found a new prime.
- Removed the second loop for pushing odd numbers into `primes`, because it's faster to just check for primality on the fly when we need it.
- Changed the `if-else` block inside the second loop to a single `if` statement with a conditional increment of `count`. This is faster because it avoids branching.
