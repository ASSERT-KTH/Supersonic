Explanation:
- Changed `list<int>` to `vector<int>` for `primes` and `inputs` as vectors are generally faster and use less memory.
- Removed unnecessary `using namespace std;`.
- Moved `primes.push_back(2);` inside `sieve()` as we only need to add 2 to the list once.
- Removed the check for even numbers in `sieve()` as they are not prime and we can start the loop from 3 and increment by 2 to only check odd numbers.
- Added a check for `if (v[i])` before adding `i` to the primes vector and marking its multiples as non-prime.
- Removed the `else if` check in the inner loop of `main()` as it is unnecessary. If `p` is greater than `x`, the loop will break anyway.
- Changed the `list<int>` type to `vector<int>` for `primes` in the function signature of `sieve()`. This is because `vector<int>` is faster than `list<int>` and we are not using any of the list-specific functions in `sieve()`.
