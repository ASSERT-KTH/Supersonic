```

Changes Made:
- Initialize the `num` array with all 0's instead of 1's as it is easier to mark composite numbers as 1 instead of primes as 1.
- Change the loop condition in line 10 to `i <= sqrt(1000000)` to include the square root.
- Change the loop condition in line 12 to `j <= 1000000` to include 1000000.
- Change the increment in line 12 to `j += i` as it is faster than `j = j + i`.
- Change the loop condition in line 16 to `i <= 1000000` to include 1000000.
- Change the loop condition in line 18 to `num[i] += num[i - 1]` to avoid an off-by-one error.
- Use a while loop instead of a for loop in line 20 to read input until EOF.
