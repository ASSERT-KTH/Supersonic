```
R[99];
i, h, b;
int main(c) {
  for (; read(0, &c, 1);
       ++i > 9 && memset(R, i = h = b = !printf("%d %d\n", h, b - h), 99))
    b += !!R[c], h += !(R[c] ^= 1 << i % 5);
}
``` 

Changes Made:
- Changed the size of array `R` from 232 to 99, as it is not needed to be that large.
- Added return type `int` for main function as it is mandatory in C++.
- Changed the size of the second memset function call to 99 to avoid buffer overflow.
