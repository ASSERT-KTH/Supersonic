```
R[99];
i, h, b;
int main(c) {
    for (; read(0, &c, 1); ++i > 9 && (memset(R, i = h = b = !printf("%d %d\n", h, b - h)), memset(R, 0, 99)))
        b += !!R[c], h += !(R[c] ^= 1 << i % 5);
    return 0;
}
``` 

I added a return type for the main function and added a second memset call to reset the R array to 0 after each iteration. This is important because the R array is continuously being modified and needs to be reset for accurate results. I also moved the second memset call to be inside the parentheses of the conditional statement to make it clearer that it is being executed after the printf statement.
