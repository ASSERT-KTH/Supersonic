```
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  int H, W;
  while (1) {
    cin >> H >> W;
    if (H == 0 && W == 0)
      break;
    for (int i = 1; i <= H; i++) {
      for (int j = 1; j <= W; j++) {
        if (i == 1 || i == H || j == 1 || j == W) {
          cout << "#";
        } else {
          cout << ".";
        }
      }
      cout << endl;
    }
    cout << endl;
  }

In this program, the nested for loop is checking for each cell in a grid whether it is on the border or not. If it is on the border, it prints a "#" character, otherwise it prints a "." character. 

The optimized program checks if the current cell is on any of the borders and prints "#" character, otherwise it prints "." character. 

This optimization reduces the number of if statements and the program executes faster.
