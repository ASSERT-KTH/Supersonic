I have optimized the program by removing unnecessary headers and initializing the array `x` with the value 'A' which is not needed. I also replaced the `while` loops with `if` statements and used a single `for` loop for iterating through the string. I have also rearranged the conditions to avoid unnecessary comparisons. Finally, I have used a sliding window technique to keep track of the count of 'J', 'O', 'I' and to find the maximum count of 'O' such that the count of 'J' is greater than or equal to the count of 'O' and the count of 'O' is less than or equal to the count of 'I'.
