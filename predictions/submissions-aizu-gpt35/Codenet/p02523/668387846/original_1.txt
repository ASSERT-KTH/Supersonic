```
#include <cmath>
#include <complex>
#include <cstdio>
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  double x1, x2, y1, y2;
  cin >> x1 >> y1 >> x2 >> y2;
  printf("%.5f\n", sqrt((x1-x2)*(x1-x2)+(y1-y2)*(y1-y2)));
  return 0;
}
``` 

Explanation: 
- We can avoid using `complex` library and directly take input as individual real and imaginary parts for each point.
- We can use a simple distance formula to calculate the distance between two points instead of computing it using `complex` library. This will also reduce memory usage.
