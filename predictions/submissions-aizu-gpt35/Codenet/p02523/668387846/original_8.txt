```
#include <cmath>
#include <complex>
#include <cstdio>
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  double x1, y1, x2, y2;
  cin >> x1 >> y1 >> x2 >> y2;
  printf("%.5f\n", sqrt(pow(x1 - x2, 2) + pow(y1 - y2, 2)));
  return 0;
}
``` 

I replaced the complex numbers with simple variables and used the distance formula to calculate the distance between two points. This is a simpler and more efficient way to calculate the distance.
