```
#include <cmath>
#include <complex>
#include <cstdio>
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  double a, b, c, d;
  cin >> a >> b >> c >> d;
  printf("%.5f\n", sqrt((a - c) * (a - c) + (b - d) * (b - d)));
  return 0;
}
``` 

Explanation: 

1. The `complex` library is not necessary for calculating the distance between two points in a 2D plane. Instead, we can simply use the distance formula: `sqrt((x1 - x2)^2 + (y1 - y2)^2)`.

2. We can replace the `complex` variables with four `double` variables, one for each coordinate.

3. We can then use the distance formula to calculate the distance between the two points.

4. Finally, we can use `printf` to output the result with 5 decimal places.
