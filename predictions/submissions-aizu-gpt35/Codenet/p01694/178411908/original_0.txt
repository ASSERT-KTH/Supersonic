```
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  int n;
  while (cin >> n, n) {
    int ans = 0;
    string now = "", next;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
      cin >> next;
      if (now == "lu" && next == "ru")
        ++ans;
      else if (now == "ru" && next == "lu")
        ++ans;
      else if (now == "ld" && next == "rd")
        ++ans;
      else if (now == "rd" && next == "ld")
        ++ans;
      now = next;
    }
    cout << ans << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Optimizations:
- Removed unnecessary headers.
- Removed macros and replaced them with regular for-loops.
- Replaced `rep(i,n)` with `for(int i=0;i<n;++i)`.
- Removed `each` macro as it's not used in the program.
- Removed unnecessary typedefs.
- Removed `const` variables that are not used in the program.
- Changed `rep(i,n)` to `for(int i=0;i<n;++i)` for consistency.
- Used pre-increment instead of post-increment for better performance.
