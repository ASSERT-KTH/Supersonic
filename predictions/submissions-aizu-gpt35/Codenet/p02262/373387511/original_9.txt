Changes Made:
- In the function `insertionSort`, the loop was starting from `g-1` instead of `g`. This was corrected.
- In the function `insertionSort`, the swap was performed using a temporary variable. Instead, I used the `swap` function from the standard library.
- In the function `selectionSort`, the loop for generating the series `G` was made more efficient by using a single `for` loop instead of a `while` loop.
- In the `main` function, I changed the loop condition in `selectionSort` to `h < n/3` instead of an infinite loop with a `break` statement. This is more efficient than checking an infinite loop at each iteration. 
- No unnecessary variables were declared.
