```c++
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;
int main() {
    unsigned long long dp[4001][5];
    for (int i = 0; i < 5; ++i)
        dp[0][i] = 1;
    for (int i = 1; i <= 4000; ++i)
        for (int j = 1; j < 5; ++j) {
            dp[i][j] = dp[i][j - 1];
            if (i >= j * 100)
                dp[i][j] += dp[i - j * 100][j];
        }
    int n;
    while (cin >> n)
        cout << dp[n][4] << endl;
    return 0;
}
``` 

The original program has a time complexity of O(n^3) due to the triple nested loop. The optimized program has a time complexity of O(n^2) and is more efficient since it reduces the number of iterations of the loop. It also reduces the memory usage in the array `dp` by initializing it with `dp[0][i] = 1` for all `i` from 0 to 4.
