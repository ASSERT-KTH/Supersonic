Explanation:
1. In the original program, the array S is declared using variable n, which is not a constant expression. This is not allowed in C++. To fix this, we can declare the array S after reading the value of n, using the new value of n.

2. The original program has an off-by-one error when setting the right index of the binary search. The right index should be n-1 instead of n.

3. The original program has an off-by-one error when updating the right index during the binary search. We need to set the right index to mid-1 instead of mid. 

4. The while loop condition should be left <= right instead of left < right. This is because we need to check the element at the right index in case it is the target element.
