Explanation: 

1. Changed the size of the edge vector to V instead of 10001 as it is not necessary to allocate memory to all nodes that do not exist in the graph.
2. Changed the state vector to zero-initialized rather than creating a vector with V size and initializing all elements to zero.
3. Added a queue to store the nodes with zero in-degree.
4. Removed the second for loop that iterates over the state vector as it is not necessary since the queue stores all the nodes with zero in-degree.
5. Modified the loop that iterates over the edge vector such that it uses a queue rather than a nested loop.
6. Added 1 to the printed node number to match the input format.
