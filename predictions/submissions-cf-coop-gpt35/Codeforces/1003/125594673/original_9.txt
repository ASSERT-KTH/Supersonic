The provided code appears to be a solution to a problem that involves performing a series of queries on an array of integers. The goal is to count the number of integers in the array that can be expressed as a sum of powers of 2, given a query value.

Upon analyzing the code, the following potential performance bottlenecks and areas for optimization can be identified:

1. The use of `pow(2, 31)` in the loop condition: The loop iterates from `pow(2, 31)` down to 1, which involves repeated calculations of this value. Since `pow(2, 31)` is a constant value, it can be stored in a variable outside the loop to avoid unnecessary computation.

2. The use of `map<int, int>` to count occurrences of each integer: The `map` data structure provides efficient lookup and insertion, but in this case, we only need to count the occurrences of each integer. Using an array to store the counts would be more efficient.

3. The use of `pow()` function to calculate powers of 2: The `pow()` function involves floating-point calculations, which can be computationally expensive. Since we only need powers of 2, these can be precalculated and stored in an array for faster access.

4. The repeated use of `cout` for each query result: Outputting the results for each query individually can be a bottleneck, especially when the number of queries is large. Instead, the results can be stored in an array and printed at the end.

Based on these observations, here is a step-by-step optimization strategy:

Step 1: Store `pow(2, 31)` in a variable outside the loop.
- Instead of calculating `pow(2, 31)` in each iteration of the loop, store it in a variable `t` before the loop.

Step 2: Replace `map<int, int>` with an array to store the counts.
- Replace the `map<int, int> mp` with an array `count` of size `pow(2, 31) + 1` to store the counts of each integer.
- Instead of `mp[value[i]]++`, use `count[value[i]]++` to increment the count.

Step 3: Precalculate and store powers of 2 in an array.
- Before the main loop, create an array `powers` to store the powers of 2 from 1 to `pow(2, 31)`.
- Use a loop to calculate and store the powers: `powers[i] = powers[i-1] * 2`.

Step 4: Store query results in an array and print at the end.
- Create an array `results` of size `q` to store the results for each query.
- Instead of printing the result for each query immediately, store it in the `results` array.
- After the loop, use a loop to print the results from the `results` array.

These optimizations aim to reduce unnecessary computations, minimize memory usage, and improve the overall efficiency of the program. The changes made are minimal yet effective, preserving the functionality and output of the original code.
