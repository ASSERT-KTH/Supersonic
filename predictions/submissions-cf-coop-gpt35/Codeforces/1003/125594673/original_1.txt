The provided code is a C++ program that reads an integer `n` and a series of `n` values. It then reads an integer `q` and `q` queries, each consisting of an integer `b`. For each query, the program calculates the sum of the minimum number of values from the given series that can be used to obtain `b` using powers of 2. If it is not possible to obtain `b` using the given series, the program outputs -1.

Upon analyzing the code, a few potential performance bottlenecks and inefficient memory usage can be identified:

1. The use of `pow()` function: The code uses the `pow()` function to calculate powers of 2. However, the `pow()` function is computationally expensive compared to bitwise shifting. Since we are dealing with powers of 2, using bitwise shifting will be more efficient.

2. The use of `map` data structure: The code uses a `map` to store the frequency of each value in the given series. While this allows efficient retrieval of frequencies, it also introduces additional memory overhead and slower access time compared to an array. Since the range of possible values is known (from 1 to 2^31), an array can be used instead of a `map` for improved performance.

3. Redundant calculation of `l`: In the calculation of the sum, the code calculates the minimum between `mp[t]` and `b / t` repeatedly. However, this calculation can be optimized by storing the value of `b / t` in a variable and using it directly in the loop.

Based on these observations, the following optimization steps can be proposed:

1. Replace the use of `pow()` function with bitwise shifting: Instead of using `pow(2, 31)`, we can use `1 << 31` to calculate the maximum power of 2. Similarly, we can use `t >> 1` instead of `t = t / 2` in the loop.

2. Replace the `map` with an array: Since we know the range of possible values, we can use an array of size `2^31` to store the frequency of each value. This will eliminate the overhead of the `map` data structure and improve access time.

3. Store `b / t` in a variable: Instead of calculating `b / t` repeatedly in the loop, we can calculate it once and store it in a variable.

Now, let's apply these optimization steps to the code:
