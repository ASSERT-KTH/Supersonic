The provided code is written in C++ and is aimed at solving a problem. However, it appears that the code contains a lot of unnecessary code and dependencies. The first step would be to remove any unnecessary includes and code snippets that are not being used.

Next, let's go through the code and identify potential areas for optimization:

1. The code includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header, which is not recommended as it includes unnecessary headers and can slow down compilation. It is better to include only the necessary headers.

2. The code defines several macros that are not used. These macros can be removed to reduce code clutter.

3. The code defines a lot of unnecessary type aliases. These aliases can be removed to improve code readability.

4. The code defines a lot of unnecessary helper functions for printing and reading. These functions can be removed and replaced with standard input/output functions (`cin` and `cout`) to improve performance.

5. The code uses a custom hash function for a `pair<int, int>` key in a `gp_hash_table`. This custom hash function is inefficient and can be replaced with a standard hash function.

6. The code creates unnecessary copies of vectors and arrays. These copies can be avoided to reduce memory usage.

7. The code uses a `vi` vector type for storing integers. This vector can be replaced with a standard `vector<int>` for improved performance.

8. The code uses a `queue<int>` for topological sorting. This can be replaced with a more efficient implementation using a `vector<int>` and an index variable.

Based on these observations, we can formulate an optimization strategy:

1. Remove unnecessary includes and code snippets.

2. Remove unnecessary macros, type aliases, and helper functions.

3. Replace the custom hash function with a standard hash function.

4. Replace `vi` vector type with `vector<int>`.

5. Optimize the topological sorting implementation.

Now, let's proceed with the optimization steps.
