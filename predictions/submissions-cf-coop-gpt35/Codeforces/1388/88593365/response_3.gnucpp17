The given code is a C++ program that solves a problem involving a directed graph. The program reads an integer `n` and two arrays `a` and `b` of size `n`. It then constructs a directed graph based on the elements of `b` and performs a topological sort on the graph. Finally, it calculates the sum of certain elements of `a` based on the topological order and prints the result.

Although the code appears to be correct and functional, there are several areas where it can be optimized for efficiency:

1. Unnecessary includes: The code includes some unnecessary header files, such as `<bits/stdc++.h>`, `<ext/pb_ds/assoc_container.hpp>`, and `<ext/pb_ds/tree_policy.hpp>`. These unnecessary includes can increase compilation time and potentially introduce unnecessary dependencies. It is recommended to remove these unnecessary includes.

2. Excessive use of macros: The code uses a large number of macros, such as `vi`, `loop`, `For`, `Rev`, `Rep`, `F`, `S`, `pb`, `em`, `all`, `mems`, `sz`, `mp`, `pf`, `po`, `ar`, `PI`, `umap`, `gmap`, `debug`, and more. While macros can provide convenience and code reusability, excessive use of macros can make the code harder to read and maintain. It is recommended to minimize the use of macros and consider using functions or inline functions instead.

3. Redundant code: The code contains some redundant or unused code blocks, such as the `__print` and `mdebug` functions. These code blocks do not contribute to the functionality of the program and can be safely removed.

4. Inefficient data structures: The code uses a `queue` data structure for the topological sort. However, a more efficient data structure for this purpose is a priority queue or a heap. Using a priority queue can reduce the time complexity of the topological sort algorithm.

5. Inefficient memory usage: The code uses multiple large arrays, such as `adj`, `adj2`, `a`, `b`, `ans1`, and `d`, which can potentially consume a significant amount of memory. It is recommended to optimize the memory usage by using smaller data structures or allocating memory dynamically as needed.

6. Lack of comments: The code lacks comments, making it difficult to understand the purpose and functionality of each section of the code. It is recommended to add comments to explain the logic and purpose of each code block.

Based on the above analysis, the following optimization strategy can be formulated:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: Remove the unnecessary header files `<bits/stdc++.h>`, `<ext/pb_ds/assoc_container.hpp>`, and `<ext/pb_ds/tree_policy.hpp>`.

2. Minimize the use of macros: Replace the excessive use of macros with functions or inline functions where appropriate.

3. Remove redundant code: Remove the `__print` and `mdebug` functions as they are not used in the program.

4. Optimize the topological sort algorithm: Replace the `queue` data structure with a priority queue or a heap to improve the efficiency of the topological sort algorithm.

5. Optimize memory usage: Analyze the memory usage of the program and identify opportunities to reduce memory consumption or optimize memory allocation.

6. Add comments: Add comments to explain the purpose and functionality of each section of the code for better readability and understanding.
