The given code is a C++ program that solves a problem using a topological sort algorithm. The program reads an integer `n` followed by two arrays `a` and `b` of size `n`. The program constructs a directed graph based on the pairs in array `b`, performs a topological sort on the graph, and then calculates the maximum sum of elements in array `a` using a specific ordering of the vertices obtained from the topological sort. Finally, the program prints the maximum sum and the ordering of the vertices.

To optimize this code, we can focus on the following areas:

1. Unnecessary header file inclusion: The code includes some unnecessary header files, such as `<bits/stdc++.h>` and `<ext/pb_ds/tree_policy.hpp>`. We should remove these unnecessary header files to improve compile time.

2. Excessive use of macros: The code uses many macros, such as `CS`, `loop`, `For`, `Rev`, `Rep`, `F`, `S`, `pb`, `em`, `all`, `mems`, `sz`, `mp`, `pf`, `po`, `ar`, `endl`, `PI`, `umap`, `gmap`, `debug`, `F_OR`, `F_OR1`, `F_OR2`, `F_OR3`, `F_OR4`, `GET5`, `F_ORC`, `FOR`, `EACH`, `read`, `to_string`, `pff`, and `print`. These macros make the code less readable and can introduce subtle bugs. We should replace them with regular functions or inline code to improve code clarity.

3. Redundant data structures and computations: The code uses multiple data structures and performs unnecessary computations. For example, the code uses two adjacency lists (`adj` and `adj2`) to represent the graph. We can optimize this by using a single adjacency list. Additionally, the code performs unnecessary computations in the `PH` and `custom_hash` structures. We can remove these structures and simplify the code.

4. Inefficient memory usage: The code uses a vector of pairs (`vi<ar<int, 2>> e`) to store the edges of the graph. This can be memory-intensive, especially for large input sizes. We should consider using a more memory-efficient representation, such as a vector of pairs of integers.

5. Lack of code organization and modularity: The code lacks proper code organization and modularity. We should separate the code into logical functions to improve readability and maintainability.

With these optimizations in mind, let's proceed with the step-by-step explanation and the optimized code.

Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. Unnecessary header file inclusion: Remove the unnecessary header files `<bits/stdc++.h>` and `<ext/pb_ds/tree_policy.hpp>`. These headers are not used in the code and can be safely removed.

2. Excessive use of macros: Replace the macros with regular functions or inline code to improve code clarity. For example, replace the `FOR` macro with a regular for loop, replace the `EACH` macro with a range-based for loop, and replace the `print` macro with a regular print function.

3. Redundant data structures and computations:
   - Remove the `adj2` adjacency list as it is not used.
   - Remove the `PH` and `custom_hash` structures as they are not used.
   - Simplify the `toposort` function by removing unnecessary variables and replacing the `sz` function with the `size` function.
   - Simplify the `solve` function by removing unnecessary variables and replacing the `offset` function with a regular addition operation.

4. Inefficient memory usage: Replace the vector of pairs `vi<ar<int, 2>> e` with a vector of pairs of integers `vector<pair<int, int>> e` to reduce memory usage.

5. Code organization and modularity: Separate the code into logical functions, such as `readInput`, `solveProblem`, and `printOutput`, to improve readability and maintainability.
