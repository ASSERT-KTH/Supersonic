The given code is a C++ program that solves a problem involving a directed graph and some arrays. The program reads input data, performs some calculations, and outputs the result. To optimize this program for efficiency, we can focus on the following aspects:

1. Unnecessary Includes: The code includes unnecessary headers that are not used in the program. We can remove the following includes:
   - `<bits/stdc++.h>`: This header includes many standard headers, which can lead to longer compilation times and increased memory usage.
   - `<ext/pb_ds/assoc_container.hpp>` and `<ext/pb_ds/tree_policy.hpp>`: These headers are not used in the program.

2. Redundant Typedefs and Defines: The code contains several typedefs and defines that are not used. We can remove the following:
   - `typedef long long ll`: This typedef is not used in the program.
   - `typedef pair<int, int> pii` and `typedef pair<ll, ll> pll`: These typedefs are not used in the program.
   - `CS custom_hash`: This define is not used in the program.

3. Unused Functions: The code defines several functions that are not used in the program. We can remove the following functions:
   - `void __print(...)`, `_print()`, `mdebug(...)`, `read(vi<A>&)`, `read(array<A, S>&)`, `void pff(A)`, `void pff(const H&, const T&...)`: These functions are not used in the program.

4. Unused Macros: The code defines several macros that are not used in the program. We can remove the following macros:
   - `F_OR`, `F_OR1`, `F_OR2`, `F_OR3`, `F_OR4`, `GET5`, `F_ORC`, `FOR`, `EACH`.

5. Unused Variables: The code declares several variables that are not used in the program. We can remove the following variables:
   - `const long mxN = 1e5 + 2`: This variable is not used in the program.
   - `struct PH` and `struct custom_hash`: These structs are not used in the program.

6. Unused Hash Function: The program defines a custom hash function `PH` that is not used. We can remove this function.

7. C++ Standard: The code includes the line `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false)` which disables the synchronization between C and C++ standard streams, which can improve the performance of input/output operations.

8. Unused Arguments: The `solve()` function has an unused argument `_`. We can remove this argument.
