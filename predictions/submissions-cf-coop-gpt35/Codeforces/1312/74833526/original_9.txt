The given code appears to be a program that takes input values for `t` (number of test cases), `n` (size of an array), and `k` (an integer). It then reads `n` integers into an array `a`. The program checks if each element of the array can be represented as a power of `k` with only 0s and 1s as digits. If all elements can be represented in this way, it outputs "YES", otherwise it outputs "NO".

Now let's analyze the code to identify potential areas for optimization:

1. The code includes unnecessary `#define` statements for input/output stream objects, which are already included in the standard library. These macros can be removed as they do not contribute to the performance of the code.

2. The code uses a `map` to keep track of the powers of `k` that have been encountered so far. However, the map is cleared after each iteration of the while loop, which makes it unnecessary to use a map at all. A simple array or a bitset can be used instead to track the powers of `k`.

3. The code uses a nested `for` loop to iterate over the elements of the array and check if each element can be represented as a power of `k`. However, this approach has a time complexity of O(n log n) due to the inner while loop that divides the number by `k` repeatedly. This can be optimized to have a linear time complexity of O(n) by using bitwise operations.

4. The code does not make use of any compiler optimizations or pragma directives. Enabling compiler optimizations can potentially improve the performance of the code.

Based on the analysis, here is an optimization strategy:

1. Remove unnecessary `#define` statements for input/output stream objects.

2. Replace the `map` with a simple array or a bitset to track the powers of `k`.

3. Optimize the check for powers of `k` by using bitwise operations instead of division.

4. Enable compiler optimizations to leverage the compiler's ability to optimize the code.

Now let's proceed with the step-by-step explanation and optimized code.
