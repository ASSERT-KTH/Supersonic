Code Analysis:
1. The code includes unnecessary header files, such as `bits/stdc++.h`, which includes a large number of standard library headers. It is advisable to include only the required headers to reduce compilation time and avoid unnecessary overhead.
2. The code uses macros for frequently-used constants and types, such as `ll` for `long long`, `pp` for `pair<long long, long long>`, and `ld` for `long double`. While macros can improve code readability, they can also lead to potential issues such as name collisions and difficulties in debugging. It is recommended to use typedefs or using statements instead of macros.
3. The code uses a custom tree implementation from the `__gnu_pbds` library. While this tree implementation can provide some advantages, such as fast ordered statistics, it may also introduce unnecessary complexity and memory overhead. It is worth considering whether a simpler data structure, such as a vector or a map, can achieve the same functionality with better performance.
4. The code uses several global variables, such as `segtree`, `lazy`, `value`, `adj`, `good`, `seta`, and `dp`. Global variables can make the code harder to understand, maintain, and optimize. It is advisable to encapsulate related variables into a class or a function to improve code organization and reduce the scope of variables.
5. The code uses recursion for the depth-first search (`dfs`) function. Recursive calls can be expensive in terms of memory usage and function call overhead. It is worth exploring iterative alternatives, such as using a stack or manually managing a recursion stack, to improve performance.
6. The code uses a segment tree to maintain and query the minimum values of subarrays. While segment trees can be efficient for range queries, the current implementation uses an array-based representation, which can lead to large memory consumption. It is worth considering alternative data structures, such as binary indexed trees (BITs) or segment trees with lazy propagation, to reduce memory usage and improve performance.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Remove unnecessary header files: Remove the inclusion of unnecessary header files, such as `bits/stdc++.h` and the `ext/pb_ds` headers, to reduce compilation time and avoid unnecessary overhead.
2. Replace macros with typedefs or using statements: Replace the macros `ll`, `pp`, and `ld` with typedefs or using statements to improve code readability and avoid potential issues.
3. Evaluate the need for the custom tree implementation: Evaluate whether the custom tree implementation from the `__gnu_pbds` library is necessary for the given problem. If not, replace it with a simpler data structure, such as a vector or a map, to reduce complexity and memory overhead.
4. Encapsulate related variables: Encapsulate the related variables (`segtree`, `lazy`, `value`, `adj`, `good`, `seta`, `dp`) into a class or a function to improve code organization and reduce the scope of variables.
5. Optimize the depth-first search (`dfs`) function: Replace the recursive implementation of the `dfs` function with an iterative alternative, such as using a stack or manually managing a recursion stack, to improve performance.
6. Evaluate alternative data structures for range queries: Evaluate alternative data structures, such as binary indexed trees (BITs) or segment trees with lazy propagation, to reduce memory usage and improve performance.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Remove unnecessary header files: Remove the inclusion of unnecessary header files, such as `bits/stdc++.h` and the `ext/pb_ds` headers. These headers include a large number of standard library headers and custom tree implementation headers, which are not required for the given code and can lead to unnecessary overhead.
2. Replace macros with typedefs or using statements: Replace the macros `ll`, `pp`, and `ld` with typedefs or using statements. For example, replace `#define ll long long` with `typedef long long ll` or `using ll = long long`. This improves code readability and avoids potential issues such as name collisions.
3. Evaluate the need for the custom tree implementation: Evaluate whether the custom tree implementation from the `__gnu_pbds` library is necessary for the given problem. If not, replace it with a simpler data structure, such as a vector or a map, to reduce complexity and memory overhead. If the custom tree implementation is necessary, consider optimizing its usage to minimize memory usage and improve performance.
4. Encapsulate related variables: Encapsulate the related variables (`segtree`, `lazy`, `value`, `adj`, `good`, `seta`, `dp`) into a class or a function. This improves code organization and reduces the scope of variables, making the code easier to understand and maintain.
5. Optimize the depth-first search (`dfs`) function: Replace the recursive implementation of the `dfs` function with an iterative alternative. For example, use a stack or manually manage a recursion stack to avoid the function call overhead and reduce memory usage. This can significantly improve performance, especially for large inputs.
6. Evaluate alternative data structures for range queries: Evaluate alternative data structures, such as binary indexed trees (BITs) or segment trees with lazy propagation, for the range query operations in the code. These data structures can provide efficient range query operations with reduced memory usage. Consider implementing and using the most suitable data structure to improve performance.
