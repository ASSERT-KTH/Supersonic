The code provided is a C++ program that performs certain queries on an array. The main optimization goal is to improve the running time and minimize memory usage.

Upon analyzing the code, the following potential areas for optimization can be identified:

1. Redundant Data Structures: The code uses several data structures, such as vectors, arrays, and sets, which might not be necessary and can be replaced with more efficient alternatives.

2. Unnecessary Computations: There are certain computations, such as updating the count and frequency arrays, that can be avoided or optimized to improve performance.

3. Inefficient Loops: The code contains nested loops that iterate through the entire array, which can be optimized by using a more efficient loop structure or by applying loop unrolling techniques.

4. Compiler Optimizations: The code already includes two pragma directives that suggest specific optimizations to the compiler. However, there might be additional compiler optimizations that can be applied to further improve performance.

Based on these observations, the following optimization strategy can be formulated:

1. Replace the vector and array data structures with more efficient alternatives, such as plain arrays, to reduce memory usage and eliminate unnecessary overhead.

2. Optimize the count and frequency update operations to minimize redundant computations.

3. Apply loop unrolling techniques to optimize the nested loops and reduce the number of iterations.

4. Evaluate the effectiveness of the existing compiler optimizations and consider additional compiler optimizations to further improve performance.

Now, let's proceed with the step-by-step explanation of each optimization step:

1. Replace Data Structures:
   - Replace vector data structures with plain arrays wherever possible. This will reduce the memory overhead and improve cache locality.
   - Replace the set data structure with a bitset to track the presence of elements. This will reduce memory usage and improve lookup performance.

2. Optimize Count and Frequency Updates:
   - Instead of updating the count and frequency arrays for each element individually, we can update them in batches. This can be achieved by maintaining a separate array for each block and updating the counts and frequencies in that block only when necessary.
   - Use another bitset to track the presence of non-zero count elements in each block. This will eliminate the need for iterating over the count array to find non-zero counts.
   - When updating an element, only update the count and frequency arrays for the affected block. This will reduce the number of updates and improve performance.

3. Optimize Loops:
   - Instead of using nested loops to iterate over the entire array, divide the array into blocks and iterate over the blocks first. This will reduce the number of iterations and improve cache locality.
   - Within each block, use loop unrolling techniques to process multiple elements at once. This will reduce the number of loop iterations and minimize loop overhead.

4. Compiler Optimizations:
   - Evaluate the effectiveness of the existing compiler optimizations, such as the O3 optimization level and the SSE4 target. Consider experimenting with different optimization levels and targets to find the best combination for the given code.
   - Additionally, consider using other compiler optimizations, such as loop unrolling and function inlining, to further improve performance.
