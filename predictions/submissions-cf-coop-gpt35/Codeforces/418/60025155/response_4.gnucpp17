The given code is a C++ program that performs queries on an array. The array is initially populated with values, and then the program processes a series of queries. Each query can be of two types: either updating a value in the array or performing a query operation on the array.

Upon analyzing the code, the following potential performance bottlenecks and areas for optimization can be identified:

1. The use of the `map` data structure to convert the array values to their corresponding indices. This introduces an additional overhead in terms of memory usage and lookup time.

2. The use of multiple nested loops and function calls within the `query3` function. This can result in redundant computations and increased running time.

3. The use of the `bitset` data structure and the `vi` (vector of integers) data structure for maintaining the state of the array and counting the occurrences of elements. These data structures can be optimized to reduce memory usage and improve performance.

4. The use of the `std::complex` data structure from the `<complex>` header. This header is included but not used in the given code, which adds unnecessary overhead.

Based on the analysis, the following optimization strategy can be formulated:

1. Replace the use of the `map` data structure with a more efficient alternative, such as a `vector` or `unordered_map`, to convert the array values to their corresponding indices.

2. Optimize the `query3` function to eliminate redundant computations and minimize function calls.

3. Replace the `bitset` and `vi` data structures with more efficient alternatives, such as arrays or custom data structures, to reduce memory usage and improve performance.

4. Remove the unnecessary inclusion of the `<complex>` header.
