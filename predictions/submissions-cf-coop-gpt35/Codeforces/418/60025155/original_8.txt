The given code is a C++ program that performs range queries on an array. The program uses a block-based approach to optimize the queries. However, there are several areas of the code that can be optimized further.

1. Unnecessary Includes: The code includes several unnecessary header files that are not used in the program. These include `<ext/pb_ds/assoc_container.hpp>`, `<ext/pb_ds/tree_policy.hpp>`, and `<ext/rope>`. These should be removed to improve compilation time.

2. Macro Definitions: The code uses several macro definitions such as `FOR`, `F0R`, `FORd`, `F0Rd`, `trav`, `mp`, `pb`, `f`, `s`, `lb`, `ub`, `sz`, `all`, `rsz`, `MOD`, `INF`, `PI`, `ckmin`, and `ckmax`. While these macros provide shorthand notations, they can make the code harder to read and understand. It is recommended to replace these macros with standard C++ constructs to improve code readability.

3. Redundant Data Structures: The code uses two-dimensional arrays `cnt` and `CNT` to store the count of numbers in each block. However, these arrays can be replaced with a one-dimensional array and a map to achieve the same functionality with reduced memory usage.

4. Unnecessary Bitset: The code uses a bitset `in` to keep track of the count of distinct numbers in each block. However, this bitset is not necessary as the count can be obtained directly from the `CNT` array. Removing this bitset will reduce memory usage.

5. Unnecessary Map: The code uses a map `m` to map numbers to their corresponding indices. However, this map is not necessary as the same functionality can be achieved using an unordered_map or a simple vector. Using a vector will provide faster access times and reduce memory usage.

6. Redundant Queries: The code performs two types of queries - query2 and query3. However, query3 can be simplified and combined with query2 to avoid redundant calculations.

7. Compiler Optimizations: The code includes two pragma directives - `#pragma GCC optimize("O3")` and `#pragma GCC target("sse4")`. These directives instruct the compiler to optimize the code for speed and enable SSE4 instructions, respectively. These optimizations can improve the performance of the code.

To optimize the code, follow these steps:

1. Remove unnecessary header file includes:
   - Remove the following lines:
     ```cpp
     #include <ext/pb_ds/assoc_container.hpp>
     #include <ext/pb_ds/tree_policy.hpp>
     #include <ext/rope>
     ```

2. Replace macro definitions:
   - Replace the macro definitions with standard C++ constructs:
     - Replace `FOR` with a standard for loop.
     - Replace `F0R` with a standard for loop.
     - Replace `FORd` with a standard for loop.
     - Replace `F0Rd` with a standard for loop.
     - Replace `trav` with a range-based for loop.
     - Replace `mp` with `make_pair`.
     - Replace `pb` with `push_back`.
     - Replace `f` with `first`.
     - Replace `s` with `second`.
     - Replace `lb` with `lower_bound`.
     - Replace `ub` with `upper_bound`.
     - Replace `sz` with `size`.
     - Replace `all` with `begin` and `end`.
     - Replace `rsz` with `resize`.
     - Replace `ckmin` with `min`.
     - Replace `ckmax` with `max`.

3. Replace two-dimensional arrays with one-dimensional array and map:
   - Replace the following lines:
     ```cpp
     int cnt[NUM][2 * MX], CNT[NUM][MX];
     bitset<MX> in[NUM];
     ```
   - With the following lines:
     ```cpp
     int cnt[NUM * BLOCK], CNT[NUM * BLOCK];
     unordered_map<int, int> m;
     ```

4. Remove unnecessary bitset:
   - Remove the following line:
     ```cpp
     bitset<MX> in[NUM];
     ```

5. Replace map with unordered_map or vector:
   - Replace the following line:
     ```cpp
     map<int, int> m;
     ```
   - With either of the following lines:
     ```cpp
     unordered_map<int, int> m;
     ```
     OR
     ```cpp
     vector<int> m;
     ```

6. Simplify and combine query2 and query3:
   - Replace the following lines:
     ```cpp
     int query2(int y) {
       // ...
     }
     int query3(int y) {
       // ...
     }
     ```
   - With the following lines:
     ```cpp
     int query(int x, int y) {
       if (x == 1) {
         return query2(y);
       } else {
         int mn = query2(y);
         int ans = 0;
         int b = y / BLOCK;
         for (int i = BLOCK * b + 1; i <= y; i++) {
           cnt[b][a[i]]++;
           ans += cnt[b][a[i]] == mn;
         }
         for (int i = BLOCK * b + 1; i <= y; i++) {
           cnt[b][a[i]]--;
         }
         return ans;
       }
     }
     ```

7. Add compiler optimizations:
   - Keep the following lines:
     ```cpp
     #pragma GCC optimize("O3")
     #pragma GCC target("sse4")
     ```
   - These directives instruct the compiler to optimize the code for speed and enable SSE4 instructions.

The optimized code is as follows:
