The given code is a C++ program that solves a problem involving queries on an array. The program uses several data structures and algorithms, such as bitsets, maps, and arrays, to efficiently handle the queries. However, there are several areas in the code that can be optimized to improve its performance. 

1. Unnecessary Includes: The code includes several unnecessary header files, such as `bits/stdc++.h` and `ext/rope`. These can be removed to reduce compile time and improve code readability.

2. Redundant Data Structures: The code uses a bitset array `in` to keep track of whether a certain count value exists in each block. This bitset array is not necessary and can be replaced with a simple boolean flag. 

3. Inefficient Counting: The code uses a nested array `cnt` to count the occurrences of each element in each block. This can be improved by using a single array and a map to store the counts. This will reduce the memory usage and improve cache locality.

4. Redundant Map Lookup: The code uses a map `m` to map each element to a unique integer value. However, this map is not necessary as the input array `A` can be directly mapped to the unique integer values using a simple array.

5. Unnecessary Loop: The code uses a loop to iterate over the elements in each block to find the count values that are not zero. This loop is unnecessary and can be replaced with a single call to the `count` function.

6. Unoptimized Queries: The code uses two separate functions `query2` and `query3` to handle different types of queries. These functions can be optimized by combining them into a single function and using conditional statements to handle the different types of queries.

7. Compiler Optimizations: The code can benefit from compiler optimizations such as loop unrolling and function inlining. These optimizations can be enabled using compiler flags or pragmas.

Now, let's go through each optimization step in detail and provide the optimized code.

Optimization Steps:

1. Remove Unnecessary Includes: Remove the unnecessary header files `bits/stdc++.h` and `ext/rope` to reduce compile time and improve code readability.

2. Replace Bitset with Boolean Flag: Replace the `bitset` array `in` with a simple boolean flag `hasCount` to track whether a certain count value exists in each block.

3. Improve Counting: Replace the nested arrays `cnt` and `CNT` with a single array `count` and a map `countMap` to store the counts of each element. Use the map to look up the count values.

4. Remove Redundant Map Lookup: Remove the map `m` and directly map the input array `A` to the unique integer values using a simple array `unique`.

5. Remove Unnecessary Loop: Replace the loop that iterates over the elements in each block to find the count values that are not zero with a single call to the `count` function.

6. Optimize Queries: Combine the `query2` and `query3` functions into a single function `query` and use conditional statements to handle the different types of queries.

7. Enable Compiler Optimizations: Enable compiler optimizations such as loop unrolling and function inlining using compiler flags or pragmas.

        int c = count[i][v];
        if (hasCount[i] && c > 0) {
            hasCount[i] = false;

        ans = count[b][a[y]];
        for (int i = BLOCK * b + 1; i <= y; i++) {
            ans += a[i] == a[y];
        }
    } else {
        int mn = query(1, y);
        for (int i = BLOCK * b + 1; i <= y; i++) {
            int c = count[b][a[i]];
            ans += c == mn;
        }
    }
    return ans;

        a[i] = get(A[i]);
        upd(i, 1);

    cin >> M;
    for (int i = 0; i < M; i++) {

            int v, p;
            cin >> v >> p;
            upd(p, -1);
            A[p] = v;
            a[p] = get(v);
            upd(p, 1);
