The given code is a C++ program that performs a series of queries on an array. The goal of the optimization is to improve the running time and minimize memory usage of the program. 

Upon analyzing the code, the following potential areas of improvement can be identified:

1. Redundant and unnecessary includes: The code includes several unnecessary headers, such as `<bits/stdc++.h>` and `<ext/rope>`. These headers can be removed to reduce compilation time and unnecessary memory usage.

2. Excessive namespace usage: The code uses multiple `using namespace` statements, which can lead to namespace pollution and potential name clashes. It is best to avoid using `using namespace` statements and instead explicitly qualify the names when necessary.

3. Redundant data structures: The code uses several data structures, such as `bitset`, `map`, and `vector`, which may not be necessary for the given problem. It is important to review the usage of these data structures and consider more efficient alternatives if possible.

4. Inefficient data structures and algorithms: The code uses a block-based approach to solve the problem, which can be improved by using more efficient data structures and algorithms. For instance, the current implementation uses a 2D array `cnt` to store the frequency counts of each element in each block. This can be replaced with a more efficient data structure, such as a hash table or a balanced search tree.

5. Unoptimized queries: The code performs two types of queries - query2 and query3 - which can potentially be optimized to reduce the running time. It is important to analyze these queries and identify any redundant computations that can be eliminated.

Based on the above analysis, the following optimization steps can be proposed:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: Remove the unnecessary headers `<bits/stdc++.h>` and `<ext/rope>`.

2. Minimize namespace usage: Remove the `using namespace` statements and explicitly qualify the names when necessary.

3. Review data structures and algorithms: Review the usage of data structures such as `bitset`, `map`, and `vector`. Consider more efficient alternatives if possible.

4. Optimize queries: Analyze the two types of queries - query2 and query3 - and identify any redundant computations that can be eliminated.

Now, let's proceed with the optimization steps in detail.

Step 1: Remove unnecessary includes
Remove the unnecessary headers `<bits/stdc++.h>` and `<ext/rope>`.

Step 2: Minimize namespace usage
Remove the `using namespace` statements and explicitly qualify the names when necessary.

Step 3: Review data structures and algorithms
Review the usage of data structures such as `bitset`, `map`, and `vector`. Consider more efficient alternatives if possible.

In the given code, the `bitset` is used to track the occurrence of each count in each block. However, since the range of counts is not known in advance, it is better to use a `vector` instead. Each element in the `vector` represents the occurrence of a count in a block. This will eliminate the need for the `bitset` and the `map`.

Additionally, the current implementation uses a 2D array `cnt` to store the frequency counts of each element in each block. This can be replaced with a more efficient data structure, such as a hash table or a balanced search tree. This will reduce the memory usage and improve the running time of the program.

Step 4: Optimize queries
Analyze the two types of queries - query2 and query3 - and identify any redundant computations that can be eliminated.

In query2, the code iterates from the start of the block to the given index `y` and counts the occurrences of the element `a[y]` in the block. This can be optimized by precomputing and storing the count of each element in each block. Then, to calculate the count in query2, we can simply retrieve the precomputed count from the corresponding block.

In query3, the code calculates the minimum count (`mn`) and then iterates through the blocks to count the occurrences of counts greater than or equal to `mn`. This can be optimized by maintaining a list of counts in each block that have at least one occurrence. Then, in query3, we can iterate through the list of counts and sum up the counts that are greater than or equal to `mn`.

With these optimization steps in mind, let's proceed with the optimized code.
