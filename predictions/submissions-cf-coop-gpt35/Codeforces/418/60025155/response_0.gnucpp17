The given code appears to be a solution to a problem involving queries on an array. The code uses an array `a` to store the values of the original array `A`, and it maintains two-dimensional arrays `cnt` and `CNT` to keep track of the count of each value in each block of the array.

Upon analysis, the following potential performance bottlenecks and areas for optimization can be identified:

1. Redundant memory usage: The code uses two-dimensional arrays `cnt` and `CNT` to store the count of each value in each block. However, this information can be easily calculated on the fly using the original array `a`. Storing this information in separate arrays consumes additional memory unnecessarily.

2. Inefficient query2 and query3 functions: The functions `query2` and `query3` have a time complexity of O(BLOCK), where BLOCK is the size of each block. These functions are called for each query, resulting in a significant amount of repeated calculations. This can be optimized to achieve a better time complexity.

3. Unnecessary use of STL containers: The code uses various STL containers such as `vector`, `map`, and `bitset` to store and manipulate data. While these containers are convenient to use, they may not always provide the most efficient performance. It is worth considering whether these containers can be replaced with more efficient data structures.

Based on these observations, the following optimizations can be proposed:

1. Remove the arrays `cnt` and `CNT` and calculate the counts on the fly using the original array `a`. This eliminates the redundant memory usage and reduces the complexity of the code.

2. Optimize the `query2` and `query3` functions to improve their time complexity. One possible approach is to maintain a separate count array for each block, which keeps track of the count of each value within that block. This allows us to calculate the counts for each query more efficiently.

3. Replace the use of STL containers such as `vector`, `map`, and `bitset` with more efficient data structures where applicable. For example, using a simple array instead of a `map` can improve performance.
