The given code seems to be solving a problem related to range queries on an array. The main optimization opportunity in this code lies in the range queries. Currently, for each query, the code iterates through the entire array to calculate the result. This results in a time complexity of O(N) for each query, which can be improved.

To optimize the range queries, we can use a precomputation technique called "Square Root Decomposition". This technique divides the array into blocks of size sqrt(N) and stores some precomputed information for each block. This allows us to answer range queries in O(sqrt(N)) time complexity.

Here is the step-by-step explanation of the optimization strategy:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The code includes several headers that are not being used. We can remove the unnecessary includes to improve compilation time and reduce the code size.

2. Replace custom vector types: The code uses custom vector types such as `vi` and `vl` which are not necessary. We can replace them with the standard `vector<int>` and `vector<ll>` types.

3. Simplify macro definitions: The code uses several macros such as `FOR`, `F0R`, `FORd`, `F0Rd`, etc. Instead of using these macros, we can directly use loops to improve code readability.

4. Replace `map` with `unordered_map`: The code uses a `map` to store a mapping between array elements and their indices. Since we only need to access the values based on the keys, we can use an `unordered_map` instead of a `map` for faster lookups.

5. Implement Square Root Decomposition: We will divide the array into blocks of size sqrt(N) and store precomputed information for each block. This includes the count of each element in the block and the count of each count value in the block. This will allow us to answer range queries efficiently.

6. Update function: Modify the `upd` function to update the precomputed information for the affected block when an element in the array is changed.

7. Query functions: Implement two query functions, `query2` and `query3`, to answer the range queries based on the precomputed information for each block.

8. Main function: Modify the main function to use the updated functions for updating the array and answering the range queries.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <cmath>
using namespace std;

const int MX = 100005;
const int BLOCK = 1000;

int cnt[MX], CNT[MX][MX], a[MX], A[MX];
vector<int> con[MX/BLOCK + 1];
unordered_map<int, int> m;

int get(int x) {
  if (!m.count(x)) {
    int sz = m.size();
    m[x] = sz;
  }
  return m[x];
}

void upd(int p, int inc) {
  int v = a[p];
  int b = p / BLOCK;
  CNT[b][cnt[v]]--;
  cnt[v] += inc;
  CNT[b][cnt[v]]++;
  if (cnt[v] > 0 && find(con[b].begin(), con[b].end(), cnt[v]) == con[b].end()) {
    con[b].push_back(cnt[v]);
  }
}

int query2(int y) {
  int b = y / BLOCK;
  int ans = cnt[a[y]];
  for (int i = BLOCK * b + 1; i <= y; i++) {
    if (a[i] == a[y]) {
      ans++;
    }
  }
  return ans;
}

int query3(int y) {
  int mn = query2(y);
  int ans = 0;
  int b = y / BLOCK;

  vector<int> ok;
  for (int i : con[b]) {
    if (CNT[b][i]) {
      ok.push_back(i);
      if (i >= mn) {
        ans += CNT[b][i];
      }
    }
  }
  con[b] = ok;

  for (int i = BLOCK * b + 1; i <= y; i++) {
    cnt[a[i]]++;
    if (cnt[a[i]] == mn) {
      ans++;
    }
  }
  for (int i = BLOCK * b + 1; i <= y; i++) {
    cnt[a[i]]--;
  }

  return ans;
}

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  
  int N;
  cin >> N;
  for (int i = 1; i <= N; i++) {
    cin >> A[i];
    a[i] = get(A[i]);
    upd(i, 1);
  }
  
  int M;
  cin >> M;
  for (int i = 0; i < M; i++) {
    int t;
    cin >> t;
    if (t == 1) {
      int v, p;
      cin >> v >> p;
      upd(p, -1);
      A[p] = v;
      a[p] = get(v);
      upd(p, 1);
    } else {
      int x, y;
      cin >> x >> y;
      if (x == 1) {
        cout << A[y] << endl;
      } else {
        if (x % 2 == 0) {
          cout << query2(y) << endl;
        } else {
          cout << query3(y) << endl;
        }
      }
    }
  }

  return 0;
}
```

This optimized code should provide significant performance improvements compared to the original code. The range queries are now answered in O(sqrt(N)) time complexity instead of O(N). Additionally, unnecessary includes and custom vector types have been removed to simplify the code.
