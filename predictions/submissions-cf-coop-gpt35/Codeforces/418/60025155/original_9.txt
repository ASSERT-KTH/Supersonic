The given code is a C++ program that performs a series of operations on an array of integers. The operations include updating the array values and querying the array for specific values. However, the code can be optimized to improve its efficiency and reduce memory usage. 

### Code Analysis
1. The code includes unnecessary header files that are not used in the program. These header files can be removed to reduce the compile time.
2. The code uses a custom implementation of a map `m` to store the mapping between integers and their indices. However, this can be replaced with a more efficient data structure, such as `unordered_map` or `vector`, which can provide a constant-time lookup.
3. The code uses a two-dimensional array `cnt` to store the frequency of each integer in each block. However, this array can be replaced with a one-dimensional array `cnt` to store the frequency of each integer in the entire array.
4. The code uses a bitset `in` to keep track of the frequencies of each integer in each block. However, this bitset can be replaced with a simple boolean flag to indicate whether a frequency has been updated or not.
5. The code performs redundant computations in the `query2` and `query3` functions by iterating over the entire array for each query. These computations can be optimized to improve the running time.

### Optimization Strategy
1. Remove unnecessary header files: Remove the unnecessary header files `bits/stdc++.h`, `ext/pb_ds/assoc_container.hpp`, `ext/pb_ds/tree_policy.hpp`, and `ext/rope`.
2. Replace custom map implementation: Replace the custom map implementation `m` with an `unordered_map` to improve the lookup time for integer indices.
3. Replace two-dimensional array with one-dimensional array: Replace the two-dimensional array `cnt` with a one-dimensional array to store the frequency of each integer in the entire array.
4. Replace bitset with boolean flag: Replace the bitset `in` with a boolean flag to indicate whether a frequency has been updated or not.
5. Optimize `query2` and `query3` functions: Optimize the `query2` and `query3` functions to avoid redundant computations by storing the frequency of each integer in a separate array.

### Step-by-Step Explanation
1. Remove unnecessary header files: Remove the unnecessary header files `bits/stdc++.h`, `ext/pb_ds/assoc_container.hpp`, `ext/pb_ds/tree_policy.hpp`, and `ext/rope`. These header files are not used in the program and can be safely removed.

2. Replace custom map implementation: Replace the custom map implementation `m` with an `unordered_map` to improve the lookup time for integer indices. This can be done by replacing the line `map<int, int> m;` with `unordered_map<int, int> m;`.

3. Replace two-dimensional array with one-dimensional array: Replace the two-dimensional array `cnt[NUM][2 * MX]` with a one-dimensional array `cnt[2 * MX]` to store the frequency of each integer in the entire array. This can be done by replacing the lines:
```cpp
int cnt[NUM][2 * MX], CNT[NUM][MX];
```
with:
```cpp
int cnt[2 * MX], CNT[NUM][MX];
```
Note that the two-dimensional array `CNT` is still required as it stores the frequency of each integer for each block.

4. Replace bitset with boolean flag: Replace the bitset `in[NUM]` with a boolean flag `updated[NUM]` to indicate whether a frequency has been updated or not. This can be done by replacing the lines:
```cpp
bitset<MX> in[NUM];
```
with:
```cpp
bool updated[NUM];
```
Update the code accordingly to use the boolean flag instead of the bitset.

5. Optimize `query2` and `query3` functions: Optimize the `query2` and `query3` functions to avoid redundant computations by storing the frequency of each integer in a separate array. This can be done by following these steps:
    - Create a new array `freq` of size `NUM` to store the frequency of each integer for each block.
    - Initialize the array `freq` to all zeros.
    - In the `upd` function, update the frequency of each integer in the `freq` array instead of the `cnt` array.
    - In the `query2` function, calculate the frequency of the integer by adding the value from the `freq` array and iterating over the elements in the current block.
    - In the `query3` function, calculate the minimum frequency by iterating over the elements in the `freq` array and the current block, and calculate the total count by summing the frequencies greater than or equal to the minimum frequency.
