The given code is an implementation of a graph algorithm that finds the maximum weight of an edge between two nodes. The code uses a disjoint-set data structure (DSU) to keep track of the connected components of the graph. The algorithm processes a series of queries, each consisting of a range of edges, and returns the maximum weight of an edge within that range.

Upon analysis, the following potential areas of optimization can be identified:

1. Memory Usage: The code uses a fixed-size array `dsu` to store the disjoint-set data structure. This array has a size of `N * 2`, where `N` is the number of nodes in the graph. However, the actual number of nodes used in the graph is `n`, which may not necessarily be equal to `N`. This leads to unnecessary memory usage and can be optimized.

2. Sorting: The code sorts the array `hh` using a custom comparator lambda function. The sorting is performed on the entire array `hh`, but only a subset of it is used in each query. This is inefficient as it incurs a performance cost for sorting unnecessary elements.

3. Joining Components: The `join` function in the code performs two operations: updating the parent of one component and merging two components. However, the code uses an if-else block to handle these operations separately. This can be simplified for better performance.

4. Compiler Optimizations: The code does not include any specific compiler optimizations or pragma directives to guide the compiler in optimizing the code. Adding appropriate compiler optimizations can potentially improve the performance of the code.

Based on these observations, the following optimization strategy can be formulated:

1. Optimize Memory Usage: Instead of using a fixed-size array `dsu`, use a dynamically allocated array of size `n * 2`, where `n` is the number of nodes in the graph. This will reduce unnecessary memory usage.

2. Partial Sorting: Instead of sorting the entire array `hh`, sort only the relevant subset of `hh` for each query. This will improve the efficiency of the sorting operation.

3. Simplify Component Joining: Simplify the `join` function to merge components and update the parent in a single operation. This will eliminate the need for the if-else block and improve performance.

4. Compiler Optimizations: Add appropriate compiler optimizations or pragma directives to guide the compiler in optimizing the code. This can include loop unrolling, function inlining, or other compiler-specific optimizations.

Next, let's go through each optimization step in detail and update the code accordingly.
