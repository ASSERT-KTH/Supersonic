Analysis:
- The code includes several unnecessary includes, such as `bits/stdc++.h`, which can be replaced with the specific headers required.
- The code uses macros extensively, which can make the code harder to read and maintain.
- The code uses a 2D array `dp` to store the dynamic programming values, but the array is not efficiently used.
- The code performs unnecessary modulo operations after each addition, which can be avoided.
- The code has unnecessary loop iterations that can be optimized.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Remove unnecessary includes and macros to improve code readability and reduce compilation time.
2. Optimize the usage of the `dp` array by reducing its size and accessing it efficiently.
3. Avoid unnecessary modulo operations after each addition by using a temporary variable to store the sum.
4. Optimize the loops to reduce unnecessary iterations.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Remove unnecessary includes and macros:
   - Remove the `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` and replace it with the specific headers required, such as `iostream`, `vector`, `unordered_map`, etc.
   - Remove the unnecessary macros, such as `ll`, `ld`, `vi`, etc., and replace them with their respective types.
   - Remove the unnecessary `tez` macro, as it is not used in the code.

2. Optimize the usage of the `dp` array:
   - Since the code only uses the previous row of the `dp` array to compute the current row, we can reduce the size of the array to 2 rows instead of `n+1` rows.
   - Instead of using `dp[l][j-1]` in the inner loop, we can use a temporary variable `temp` to store the value, which reduces the number of memory accesses.
   - Update the `dp` array using the formula `dp[i][j] = (dp[i][j] + temp) % MOD;` to avoid unnecessary modulo operations after each addition.

3. Avoid unnecessary modulo operations:
   - Instead of performing modulo operations after each addition, we can use a temporary variable `sum` to store the sum and perform the modulo operation once at the end.
   - Update the `ans` variable using the formula `ans = (ans + dp[i][k]) % MOD;` to avoid unnecessary modulo operations after each addition.

4. Optimize the loops:
   - Change the order of the loops to iterate from `1` to `n` instead of from `n` to `0`. This allows us to remove the `memset` operation, as the initial values of `dp` are already `0`.
   - In the inner loop, instead of iterating from `2*i` to `n` with a step size of `i`, we can iterate from `i` to `n` with a step size of `i`. This reduces the number of iterations and improves performance.

Optimized Code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>

const int MOD = 1e9 + 7;

int main() {
    int n, k;
    std::cin >> n >> k;
    
    std::vector<std::vector<int>> dp(2, std::vector<int>(k + 1, 0));
    
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        dp[i % 2][1] = 1;
        for (int j = 2; j <= k; j++) {
            int temp = 0;
            for (int l = i; l <= n; l += i) {
                temp = (temp + dp[(i-1) % 2][j - 1]) % MOD;
            }
            dp[i % 2][j] = (dp[i % 2][j] + temp) % MOD;
        }
    }
    
    int ans = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        ans = (ans + dp[i % 2][k]) % MOD;
    }
    
    std::cout << ans;
    return 0;
}
```

This optimized code improves the running time and minimizes memory usage by reducing the size of the `dp` array and optimizing the loops. It also avoids unnecessary modulo operations after each addition, which further improves efficiency.
