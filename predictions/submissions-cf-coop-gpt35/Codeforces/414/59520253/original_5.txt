The given code appears to be solving a dynamic programming problem using a bottom-up approach. However, there are several areas where the code can be optimized to improve efficiency.

1. Unnecessary Header Files: The code includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header file, which is not recommended as it includes all standard headers. It is better to include only the required headers explicitly to reduce compilation time and memory overhead.

2. Redundant Macros: The code defines several macros that are not used in the code. Removing these unnecessary macros can improve code readability.

3. Unoptimized Loops: The nested loops in the code can be optimized. The current implementation has a time complexity of O(n^2), which can be reduced.

4. Unnecessary Modulus Operation: The code performs modulus operation multiple times. It can be reduced by using a temporary variable and performing the modulus operation only once.

5. Memory Allocation: The code uses a 2D array for dynamic programming, which can be memory-intensive for large values of n and k. It can be optimized by using a 1D array instead.

6. Magic Numbers: The code uses some hard-coded values like 1e9 + 7. It is better to define these as constants to improve code readability.

Based on these observations, the following optimization steps can be performed:

1. Remove unnecessary header files.
2. Remove unused macros.
3. Optimize nested loops.
4. Reduce modulus operation.
5. Optimize memory allocation.
6. Define constants for magic numbers.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

const int MOD = 1000000007;

int main() {
  std::ios::sync_with_stdio(0);
  std::cin.tie(0);
  std::cout.tie(0);

  int n, k;
  std::cin >> n >> k;

  std::vector<int> dp(n + 1, 0);
  dp[0] = 1;

  for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    for (int j = i; j <= n; j += i) {
      dp[j] += dp[i - 1];
      if (dp[j] >= MOD)
        dp[j] -= MOD;
    }
  }

  int ans = 0;
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    ans += dp[i];
    if (ans >= MOD)
      ans -= MOD;
  }

  std::cout << ans << std::endl;

  return 0;
}
```

By following these optimization steps, the code should run more efficiently, with improved performance and reduced memory usage.
