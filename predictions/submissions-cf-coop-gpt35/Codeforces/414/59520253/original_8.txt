**Code Analysis:**

Upon analyzing the provided code, I have identified a few potential performance bottlenecks and areas that could benefit from optimization:

1. Unnecessary includes: The code includes `<bits/stdc++.h>`, which is a non-standard header file and is known to slow down compilation time. It is recommended to include only the necessary standard header files.

2. Excessive use of macros: The code uses a large number of macros, such as `frw`, `bck`, `T`, `tez`, and many others. While macros can provide convenience, they can also make the code harder to read and maintain. It is recommended to minimize the use of macros and instead use inline functions or templates.

3. Unnecessary data structures: The code uses several data structures, such as `vector`, `unordered_map`, `unordered_set`, and others. It is important to analyze whether these data structures are necessary for the given problem or if simpler alternatives can be used to improve performance.

4. Redundant computations: The code includes redundant computations within loops. For example, the `dp[i][j] += dp[i][j - 1]` statement is executed for each iteration of the inner loop, even though it could be moved outside the loop to avoid redundant computations.

5. Inefficient memory usage: The code uses a 2D array `dp[n+1][k+1]` to store intermediate results. However, this array is not fully utilized, as only a portion of it is accessed. This leads to inefficient memory usage.

Based on these observations, let's formulate an optimization strategy.
