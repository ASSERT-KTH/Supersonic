Code Analysis:
- The code includes several unnecessary and redundant header files.
- The code uses macros excessively, which can lead to code readability issues.
- The code uses an inefficient way to initialize and populate the 2D array `dp`.
- The innermost loop in the `bck` loop is not necessary and can be optimized.
- The code performs modulo operations multiple times, which can be optimized.
- The code can benefit from using more descriptive variable names for better code readability.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Remove unnecessary and redundant header files.
2. Minimize the use of macros and replace them with proper C++ constructs.
3. Optimize the initialization and population of the `dp` array.
4. Optimize the innermost loop in the `bck` loop.
5. Optimize the modulo operations.
6. Rename variables for better code readability.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Remove unnecessary and redundant header files:
   - The `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` header includes a large number of unnecessary standard library headers. Instead, include the specific headers that are actually needed, such as `<iostream>` and `<vector>`.

2. Minimize the use of macros and replace them with proper C++ constructs:
   - Macros such as `frw`, `bck`, `tez`, and others can be replaced with regular C++ constructs like functions or loops.

3. Optimize the initialization and population of the `dp` array:
   - The current code initializes the `dp` array using `memset`, which is not efficient for non-trivial data types like `int`. Instead, use a nested loop to initialize each element of the array to 0.

4. Optimize the innermost loop in the `bck` loop:
   - The innermost loop in the `bck` loop iterates over `l` from `2 * i` to `n` with a step size of `i`. This loop can be optimized by starting `l` from `n` and decrementing it by `i` in each iteration.

5. Optimize the modulo operations:
   - The code performs modulo operations multiple times on `dp[i][j]`. Instead, use a temporary variable to accumulate the sum and perform the modulo operation only once after the loop.

6. Rename variables for better code readability:
   - Rename variables like `n`, `k`, `dp`, `ans` to more descriptive names like `numRows`, `numCols`, `dpArray`, `sum` to improve the readability of the code.
