The given code is a C++ program that reads a graph and calculates the answer for each node. The program uses a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm to traverse the graph and count the number of nodes reachable from each starting node. The results are stored in the `ans` array and printed at the end.

However, there are several potential performance bottlenecks and inefficient memory usage in the code that can be optimized. Let's go through the code step by step and identify the areas that can be improved.

1. Redundant includes: The code includes the entire `bits/stdc++.h` library, which is not recommended as it includes many unnecessary headers. We can replace it with the necessary standard headers like `<iostream>`, `<vector>`, `<stack>`, and `<bitset>`.

2. Inefficient memory usage: The `graph` vector is declared as an array of vectors, which can lead to inefficient memory usage. Instead, we can use a single vector and store edges as pairs of integers.

3. Unnecessary function: The `num()` function is unnecessary and can be replaced with `cin >> res` directly in the `main()` function.

4. Inefficient loop: The loop in the `answer()` function iterates over all elements in the `list` vector to update the `ans` array. We can optimize this by using a range-based for loop instead.

5. Unnecessary `bitset`: The `bs` bitset is unnecessary for this problem. We can remove it and use a separate array to keep track of visited nodes.

6. Unnecessary stack: The `stack` in the `answer()` function is not needed. We can use a vector instead, which will eliminate the need to repeatedly push and pop elements from the stack.

7. Compiler optimizations: We can suggest using compiler optimizations, such as `-O2`, to enable common optimizations like loop unrolling and function inlining.

Now, let's proceed with the optimization steps.
