After analyzing the provided code, I have identified the following potential areas for optimization:

1. Input/Output Operations: The code uses the `cin` and `cout` functions, which are known to be slower than other input/output methods. By using a faster input/output method, such as `scanf` and `printf`, we can improve the overall performance of the program.

2. Data Structures: The code uses a `vector` to store the adjacency list for each vertex in the graph. However, a `vector` is not the most efficient data structure for this purpose. Using a `list` or a `set` could reduce the time complexity of certain operations, such as checking if an element exists in the list.

3. Redundant Computations: The `answer` function computes the same result multiple times for the same input. By storing the computed result in the `ans` array, we can avoid recomputing it and improve the performance.

4. Bitset Usage: The code uses a `bitset` to keep track of visited vertices. However, a `vector<bool>` could be more efficient in terms of memory usage and performance.

Based on these observations, here is the step-by-step optimization strategy:

Step 1: Replace `cin` and `cout` with `scanf` and `printf` respectively.

Step 2: Replace the `vector` data structure with a `list` or a `set` for storing the adjacency list.

Step 3: Modify the `answer` function to check if the result is already stored in the `ans` array before computing it.

Step 4: Replace the `bitset` with a `vector<bool>`.

With these optimizations, we can improve the performance and memory usage of the code.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
#define pb push_back
#define mp make_pair
#define fi first
#define se second
#define ll long long
#define MOD 1000000007
using namespace std;
int n, m;
list<int> graph[500001];
int ans[500001];
int num() {
  int res;
  scanf("%d", &res);
  return res;
}
int answer(int i) {
  if (ans[i] > 0)
    return ans[i];
  stack<int> s;
  s.push(i);
  vector<int> list;
  vector<bool> visited(n+1, false);
  visited[i] = true;
  while (!s.empty()) {
    int now = s.top();
    s.pop();
    list.pb(now);
    for (int next : graph[now])
      if (!visited[next]) {
        visited[next] = true;
        s.push(next);
      }
  }
  int res = list.size();
  for (int next : list)
    ans[next] = res;
  return res;
}
int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  cout.tie(NULL);
  n = num();
  m = num();
  for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
    int l = num() - 1;
    if (l < 0)
      continue;
    int a = num();
    while (l-- > 0) {
      int b = num();
      graph[a].pb(b);
      graph[b].pb(a);
      a = b;
    }
  }
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++)
    printf("%d ", answer(i));
  printf("\n");
}
```

These optimizations should improve the running time and memory usage of the program while preserving its functionality and output.
