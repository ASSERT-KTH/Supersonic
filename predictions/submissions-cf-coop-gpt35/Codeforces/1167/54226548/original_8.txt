Upon analyzing the given code, we can identify a few areas that could potentially be optimized:

1. Use of Input/Output Functions: The code uses `cin` and `cout` for input and output, respectively. These functions are known to be slower than their C counterparts, `scanf` and `printf`. We can replace `cin` and `cout` with `scanf` and `printf` to improve the input/output performance.

2. Unnecessary Bitset Usage: The code uses a `bitset` to keep track of the visited nodes. However, in this case, we can avoid using the `bitset` and instead use a simple boolean array to achieve the same functionality, which would be more memory efficient.

3. Redundant List Construction: The `answer` function constructs a list of nodes, which is then used to update the answer array. This is unnecessary and can be optimized by directly updating the answer array within the loop.

4. Redundant Vector Usage: The `list` vector in the `answer` function is used to store the nodes that need to be updated. However, since we can directly update the `ans` array, we don't need to store the nodes in a separate vector. This can help reduce memory usage.

Based on these observations, we can now proceed with the optimization steps.
