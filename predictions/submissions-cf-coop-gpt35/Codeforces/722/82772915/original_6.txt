The provided code seems to be a solution to a problem, but it is difficult to understand the exact functionality without the problem statement. However, we can still analyze the code and identify potential areas for optimization. 

Here are some observations and potential optimizations:

1. Preprocessor Macros: The code includes a large number of preprocessor macros that define various constants and functions. While macros can improve code readability, they can also make the code harder to understand and maintain. Consider replacing some of the macros with inline functions or constants to improve code readability.

2. Standard Library Usage: The code includes the `bits/stdc++.h` header, which includes all the standard C++ library headers. This can result in slower compilation times and increased memory usage. It is recommended to include only the necessary standard library headers.

3. Memory Usage: The code uses several global arrays (`a`, `vis`, `sum`, `fk`, `q`, `siz`, `par`) with a size of `N = 5e5 + 7`. Such large global arrays can consume a significant amount of memory. Consider using dynamic memory allocation or local variables instead, depending on the specific use case.

4. Loop Optimization: The code includes several nested loops. Analyze each loop and identify any unnecessary computations or redundant operations that can be eliminated. Consider loop unrolling, where appropriate, to reduce loop overhead and improve performance.

5. Function Optimization: The code includes several functions (`power`, `gcd`, `powm`, `ncr`, `sqr`, `root`, `merge`). Analyze each function and identify potential optimizations, such as using bitwise operations instead of arithmetic operations, or reducing the number of function calls.

6. Compiler Optimizations: Depending on the specific compiler being used, there may be certain compiler optimizations that can be enabled to improve the performance of the code. Consider using compiler-specific optimization flags or pragma directives to hint the compiler to optimize certain parts of the code.

Based on the above observations, we can now proceed with optimizing the code step by step.
