The given code is a C++ program that performs some calculations on an array of integers. However, the code contains several unnecessary or inefficient operations that can be optimized to improve performance. Here is a step-by-step optimization strategy for the code:

1. Remove unnecessary header files: The code includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header file, which is not a standard C++ header file and includes a large number of other header files. This can lead to unnecessary compilation time and increased memory usage. Instead, include only the necessary standard header files.

2. Remove unnecessary macros: The code defines several macros that are not used in the program. These macros add unnecessary complexity to the code and can be removed.

3. Remove unused variables: The code declares several variables that are not used later in the program. These variables can be safely removed to reduce memory usage.

4. Optimize the power function: The code includes a custom implementation of the `power` function. However, this function can be replaced with the standard `std::pow` function, which is likely to be more efficient.

5. Optimize the gcd function: The code includes a custom implementation of the `gcd` function. This function can be replaced with the standard `std::gcd` function, which is likely to be more efficient.

6. Optimize the powm function: The code includes a custom implementation of the `powm` function. This function can be replaced with the standard `std::pow` function, which can be used with a modulus to achieve the same result.

7. Optimize the ncr function: The code includes a custom implementation of the `ncr` function. This function can be optimized using dynamic programming to avoid redundant calculations and improve performance.

8. Optimize the sqr function: The `sqr` function is not used in the program and can be safely removed.

9. Avoid unnecessary memory allocation and deallocation: The code uses the `fill` function to initialize arrays with zeros. However, this can be done more efficiently using the `std::fill` function. Additionally, the code uses a lot of temporary arrays, which can be avoided by using variables directly.

10. Avoid unnecessary sorting and resizing: The code uses the `unique_sort` function to sort and remove duplicates from a vector. However, this can be done more efficiently using the `std::sort` and `std::unique` functions separately.

11. Avoid unnecessary loop iterations: The code uses nested loops for iterating over the elements of a vector. However, this can be simplified by using range-based for loops, which are more efficient.

12. Avoid unnecessary function calls: The code uses the `max_element` and `min_element` functions to find the maximum and minimum elements of a vector. However, these functions can be replaced with a simple loop that iterates over the elements of the vector.

13. Optimize the merge function: The `merge` function can be optimized by avoiding unnecessary swaps and comparisons.

14. Optimize the run function: The `run` function can be optimized by avoiding unnecessary array initializations and simplifying the loop structure.

15. Use a more efficient input/output method: The code uses the `cin` and `cout` objects for input and output. However, these objects are slower compared to the standard input/output functions. Using the `scanf` and `printf` functions can improve the performance.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <numeric>
#include <cmath>
using namespace std;

typedef long long ll;

void run() {
    int n;
    scanf("%d", &n);
    
    vector<ll> a(n), q(n), sum(n), fk(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        scanf("%lld", &a[i]);
        sum[i] = a[i];
    }
    
    vector<int> vis(n, 0), par(n, -1);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        scanf("%d", &q[i]);
    }
    
    ll ans = 0;
    for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; --i) {
        fk[i] = ans;
        vis[q[i]] = 1;
        ans = max(ans, a[q[i]]);
        if (vis[q[i] - 1]) {
            int x = q[i];
            int y = q[i] - 1;
            while (par[x] >= 0) {
                x = par[x];
            }
            while (par[y] >= 0) {
                y = par[y];
            }
            if (x != y) {
                ans = max(ans, sum[x] + sum[y]);
                if (par[y] < par[x]) {
                    swap(x, y);
                }
                par[x] += par[y];
                par[y] = x;
                sum[x] += sum[y];
            }
        }
        if (vis[q[i] + 1]) {
            int x = q[i];
            int y = q[i] + 1;
            while (par[x] >= 0) {
                x = par[x];
            }
            while (par[y] >= 0) {
                y = par[y];
            }
            if (x != y) {
                ans = max(ans, sum[x] + sum[y]);
                if (par[y] < par[x]) {
                    swap(x, y);
                }
                par[x] += par[y];
                par[y] = x;
                sum[x] += sum[y];
            }
        }
    }
    
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        printf("%lld\n", fk[i]);
    }
}

int main() {
    int tc = 1;
    for (int i = 0; i < tc; ++i) {
        run();
    }
    return 0;
}
```

This optimized code eliminates unnecessary computations, reduces memory usage, and improves the overall efficiency of the program.
