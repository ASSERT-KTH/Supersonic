After analyzing the provided code, I have identified several areas for potential optimization:

1. Unnecessary includes: The code includes the entire standard library with the line `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`. This is not recommended as it includes unnecessary headers and can increase compile time. It is better to include only the necessary headers.

2. Using `using namespace std;`: This statement brings all names from the `std` namespace into the global namespace. While convenient, it can lead to naming conflicts and make the code less readable. It is better to use the `std::` prefix for standard library functions and objects.

3. Redundant macros: The code defines several macros that are not used. These macros can be removed to simplify the code.

4. Unnecessary memory allocation: The `unordered_map` `mp` is unnecessarily allocated with a size of 1024 using `mp.reserve(1024)`. This may not be necessary and can be removed.

5. Redundant loop: The loop `fr0(i, n) cin >> a[i];` can be replaced with a more efficient `std::copy` operation to read the input values directly into the `a` vector.

6. Redundant sqrt calculations: The loop `fr(i, 2, sqrt(num) + 1)` calculates the square root of `num` in every iteration. It would be more efficient to calculate the square root once and store it in a variable.

7. Redundant `max_load_factor` setting: The line `mp.max_load_factor(0.25);` is setting the maximum load factor of the `unordered_map` to 0.25. This may not be necessary and can be removed.

8. Unnecessary use of `unordered_map`: The `unordered_map` `mp` is used to store the frequency of values. However, since the values are limited to `dp[a[i]]`, which is an integer, it would be more memory-efficient to use a regular array instead of an `unordered_map`.

9. Redundant check in the loop `for (auto it : mp)`: The condition `if (it.S % 2 == 0 || it.F == 1)` is checking if the frequency is even or if the value is 1. Since the array is initialized to store only prime factors, the frequency of any value will either be 1 or an odd number. Therefore, this condition can be simplified to `if (it.S % 2 == 0)`.

10. Redundant `max` calculation: The line `max(ans1, ans2)` is unnecessary since `ans1` is always greater than or equal to `ans2`. Therefore, it can be simplified to just `ans1`.
