The provided code is a C++ program that solves a problem involving prime factorization. The code reads an input number `n` and an array of `n` integers. It then calculates the prime factorization of each integer and performs some operations on the obtained factors.

Upon analysis, the following potential areas for optimization can be identified:

1. Redundant includes: The code includes the entire `<bits/stdc++.h>` header, which is not recommended and can slow down the compilation process. It is better to include only the necessary headers.

2. Excessive use of macros: The code uses macros extensively for common operations like input/output and looping. However, this can make the code less readable and harder to understand. It is recommended to use functions or inline code instead of macros.

3. Unnecessary use of a `unordered_map`: The code uses an `unordered_map` to store the frequency of each prime factor. However, since the prime factors are integers, a simple array can be used instead, which will be more memory-efficient and faster.

4. Inefficient prime factorization algorithm: The code uses a simple trial division algorithm to find the prime factors of each number. This is not the most efficient algorithm for large numbers. A better approach would be to use the Sieve of Eratosthenes to precompute all prime numbers up to a certain limit and then use these prime numbers to find the prime factors.

5. Inefficient loop iteration: The code uses a nested loop to iterate over the numbers and then over the prime factors. This can be optimized by using a single loop to iterate over the numbers and finding the prime factors directly.

Based on these observations, the following optimization strategy can be formulated:

1. Remove unnecessary includes and macros to improve code readability and compilation speed.

2. Replace the `unordered_map` with a simple array to store the frequency of prime factors.

3. Implement a more efficient prime factorization algorithm using the Sieve of Eratosthenes.

4. Optimize the loop iteration to find prime factors directly.

5. Remove unnecessary calculations and variables.

Now, I will provide a step-by-step explanation of each optimization and provide the optimized code.
