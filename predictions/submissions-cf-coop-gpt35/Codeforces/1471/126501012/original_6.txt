Upon analyzing the code, the following potential optimizations can be identified:

1. Unnecessary Includes: The code includes the entire `bits/stdc++.h` header, which is not recommended as it increases compilation time. Instead, only include the necessary headers.

2. Unnecessary Preprocessor Definitions: The code defines `int` as `long long` and sets the value of `mod` and `endl`. These definitions are not used in the code and can be removed.

3. Input/Output Operations: The code uses `cin` and `cout` for input and output operations. While this is convenient, it can be slower compared to other input/output methods. Using `scanf` and `printf` functions can improve performance.

4. Vector Initialization: The code initializes vectors `a` and `b` with size `n` using the default constructor, which introduces unnecessary overhead. Instead, we can initialize the size of these vectors beforehand.

5. Redundant Function Call: The `getN` function is called twice for each element of the vector `a`. This can be reduced to a single call by modifying the loop where `b[i]` is assigned.

6. Unnecessary Minimum Calculation: The second loop unnecessarily calculates the minimum value of `b[i]` using `min(b[i], tok)` twice. This can be avoided by calculating it only once and then assigning it to `tok`.

7. Redundant Minimum Calculation: In the final loop, calculating `1 + tok` for `b[i]` can be avoided by initializing `tok` as `b[n-1] + 1` and simplifying the calculation.

To optimize the code, the following steps can be taken:

1. Remove unnecessary includes and preprocessor definitions.
2. Replace `cin` and `cout` with `scanf` and `printf`.
3. Initialize vectors `a` and `b` with size `n` beforehand.
4. Modify the loop where `b[i]` is assigned to reduce the number of function calls.
5. Simplify the second loop by calculating the minimum value of `b[i]` and assigning it to `tok` only once.
6. Initialize `tok` as `b[n-1] + 1` in the final loop to avoid redundant calculations.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

int getN(int n, int x) {
  int cnt = 0;
  while (n > 0 && n % x == 0) {
    ++cnt;
    n /= x;
  }
  return cnt;
}

void solve() {
  int n, x;
  scanf("%d %d", &n, &x);
  
  vector<int> a(n), b(n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    scanf("%d", &a[i]);
  }
  
  int sum = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    b[i] = getN(a[i], x);
  }
  
  int tok = b[0];
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    b[i] = min(b[i], tok);
    tok = min(tok, b[i]);
  }
  
  tok = b[n - 1] + 1;
  for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; --i) {
    b[i] = min(b[i], tok);
    tok = min(tok, b[i]);
    sum += b[i] * a[i] + a[i];
  }
  
  printf("%d\n", sum);
}

int main() {
  int t;
  scanf("%d", &t);
  while (t--) {
    solve();
  }
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized code reduces unnecessary operations and improves the overall efficiency of the program.
