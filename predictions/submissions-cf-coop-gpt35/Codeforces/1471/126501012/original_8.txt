The provided code is a C++ program that reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `x`, followed by an array `a` of `n` integers. The program then performs some calculations based on the input and outputs the result.

Upon analyzing the code, several potential areas for optimization can be identified:

1. Redundant calculations in the `getN` function: The `getN` function calculates the number of times `x` divides `n`. However, this calculation is already performed later in the code when filling the `b` array. Therefore, we can eliminate the `getN` function altogether.

2. Inefficient memory usage: The code uses two arrays, `a` and `b`, to store the input values and intermediate results. However, we can optimize memory usage by eliminating the `b` array and storing the intermediate results directly in the `a` array.

3. Unnecessary loop iterations: The first loop that fills the `b` array unnecessarily iterates over all elements of the `a` array. Since the `getN` function is removed, we can directly calculate the intermediate results using a single loop.

4. Redundant comparisons in the second loop: The second loop compares each element of the `b` array with `tok` and updates it if necessary. However, the first element of the `b` array is already assigned to `tok`, so the comparison can be skipped for the first iteration.

5. Redundant comparisons and additions in the third loop: The third loop compares each element of the `b` array with `tok` and updates it if necessary. Additionally, it performs unnecessary calculations by multiplying `b[i]` with `a[i]` and adding `a[i]` to the sum. We can optimize this loop by combining the comparisons and calculations into a single step.

Based on these observations, we can propose the following optimization strategy:

1. Remove the `getN` function and calculate the intermediate results directly in a single loop.
2. Optimize memory usage by eliminating the `b` array and storing the intermediate results directly in the `a` array.
3. Streamline the second loop to avoid redundant comparisons.
4. Combine the comparisons and calculations in the third loop to reduce the number of operations.

Now, let's apply these optimizations step by step and provide a detailed explanation of each optimization.
