Code Analysis:
- The code reads an integer `t` as input, which represents the number of test cases.
- For each test case, the code reads two integers `n` and `x`, followed by an array `a` of `n` integers.
- The code then calculates the minimum number of operations required to make all elements of the array divisible by `x`.
- Finally, the code outputs the sum of the modified array.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Avoid unnecessary I/O operations:
   - The code currently uses `cin` and `cout` for input and output. These operations can be slow, especially when there are a large number of test cases.
   - To optimize this, we can use `scanf` and `printf` instead, which are faster alternatives in C++.

2. Avoid unnecessary function calls:
   - The function `getN` is called multiple times for each element in the array `a`.
   - We can optimize this by calculating `getN` once for each element and storing the result in a separate array, instead of recalculating it every time.

3. Simplify the logic for calculating the sum:
   - The current logic for calculating the sum is not efficient.
   - We can simplify it by calculating the sum directly in the second loop, instead of using an additional loop.

4. Optimize the use of temporary variables:
   - The variables `tok` and `sum` are used as temporary variables in the code.
   - We can optimize their usage by avoiding unnecessary assignments and calculations.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Avoid unnecessary I/O operations:
   - Replace `cin` and `cout` with `scanf` and `printf` respectively.
   - This will improve the input/output performance.

2. Avoid unnecessary function calls:
   - Create a new array `c` to store the results of the `getN` function for each element in `a`.
   - Calculate `c[i] = getN(a[i], x)` for each `i` in the range `[0, n)`.
   - This will avoid multiple function calls for the same element.

3. Simplify the logic for calculating the sum:
   - Remove the loop that calculates the minimum value of `b` and `tok`.
   - Instead, initialize `tok` as `c[0]` and calculate the sum directly in the second loop.
   - Update the sum calculation to `sum += c[i] * a[i] + a[i]`.
   - This will simplify the code and reduce the number of loop iterations.

4. Optimize the use of temporary variables:
   - Remove the unnecessary assignments to `tok` in the second and third loops.
   - Initialize `sum` as `c[n-1] * a[n-1] + a[n-1]`.
   - This will eliminate unnecessary calculations and assignments.

Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

void fast(void) __attribute__((constructor));
void fast(void) {
#ifndef ONLINE_JUDGE
  freopen("input.txt", "r", stdin);
  freopen("output.txt", "w", stdout);
#endif
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
}

int getN(int n, int x) {
  int cnt = 0LL;
  while (n > 0LL && n % x == 0LL) {
    ++cnt;
    n /= x;
  }
  return cnt;
}

void solve() {
  int n, x;
  scanf("%d%d", &n, &x);
  vector<int> a(n), c(n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    scanf("%d", &a[i]);
    c[i] = getN(a[i], x);
  }

  int sum = c[n - 1] * a[n - 1] + a[n - 1];
  for (int i = n - 2; i >= 0; --i) {
    c[i] = min(c[i], 1 + c[i + 1]);
    sum += c[i] * a[i] + a[i];
  }

  printf("%d\n", sum);
}

signed main(void) {
  int t;
  scanf("%d", &t);
  while (t--) {
    solve();
  }
  return 0;
}
```
