Code Analysis:
- The code reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` from the input.
- Then, it reads a string `s` of length `n` from the input.
- It counts the number of consecutive non-asterisk characters in the string and stores them in a vector `seat`.
- The `seat` vector is sorted in ascending order.
- Finally, it calculates the maximum number of seats that can be occupied by `a` and `b` people and prints the result.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Avoid unnecessary memory allocation:
   - The vector `seat` is used to store the lengths of non-asterisk substrings. However, we can directly calculate the maximum number of occupied seats without storing these lengths. This will save memory and avoid the need for sorting the `seat` vector.

2. Optimize seat counting:
   - Instead of storing the lengths of non-asterisk substrings in the `seat` vector, we can calculate the maximum number of occupied seats directly while iterating over the string `s`. This will eliminate the need for an additional loop and the vector `seat`.

3. Optimize the calculation of occupied seats:
   - The current approach calculates the occupied seats for each substring separately. We can optimize this by calculating the occupied seats as a cumulative sum while iterating over the string `s`. Additionally, we can simplify the calculations by using the `min` function to handle the cases where `a` or `b` is less than the calculated seats.

4. Avoid unnecessary loop iterations:
   - The current code has a `while` loop that runs only once (`t=1; while(t--)`). This loop can be removed since it does not serve any purpose.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Remove the `while` loop since it only runs once.

2. Calculate the maximum number of occupied seats while iterating over the string `s`:
   - Initialize variables `ans`, `x`, and `y` to 0.
   - Iterate over each character in `s`.
   - If the character is an asterisk, update `ans` by adding the minimum value of `a` and `b`, and reset `x` and `y` to 0.
   - If the character is not an asterisk, increment `x` by 1.
   - After the loop, update `ans` by adding the minimum value of `a` and `b`.

3. Update the output to print the calculated `ans`.

Optimized Code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int n, a, b;
  cin >> n >> a >> b;
  string s;
  cin >> s;

  int ans = 0;
  int x = 0, y = 0;

  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    if (s[i] == '*') {
      ans += min(a, b);
      x = 0;
      y = 0;
    } else {
      x++;
    }
  }
  ans += min(a, b);

  cout << ans << "\n";

  return 0;
}
```

This optimized code eliminates the need for the `vector<int> seat` and the sorting operation, reducing memory usage and improving performance. The maximum number of occupied seats is calculated directly while iterating over the string `s`, resulting in a more efficient and simplified solution.
