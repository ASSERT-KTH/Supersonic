Code Analysis:

1. The code uses a 2D array `grille` to represent a grid of characters. The dimensions of the grid are `maxLig` and `maxCol`.
2. The `proc` array is used to keep track of whether a cell in the grid has been processed or not. It is initialized to 0 at the beginning of the program.
3. The `tps` variable is used to keep track of the current timestamp. It is incremented at the beginning of each iteration of the main loop.
4. The `go` array is used to store the next position to move to for each cell in the grid.
5. The `comp` function is used to compute the next position to move to for a given cell. It uses recursion to compute the next position recursively.
6. The `getFin` function is used to compute the final position for a given cell. It iteratively follows the `go` array until it reaches a cell with the value '~'.
7. The `blocRef` array is used to keep track of the block to which each row in the grid belongs.
8. The `compBloc` function is used to compute the `go` array for a given block of rows in the grid. It iterates over the rows in the block and calls the `comp` function for each cell.
9. The main function reads the input, initializes the `grille` array, increments the `tps` variable, and then iterates over the requests.

Potential optimizations:

1. The use of `using namespace std;` is considered bad practice and should be avoided. Instead, explicitly specify the namespace for each identifier from the standard library, such as `std::pair` and `std::cout`.
2. The `pii` type is an alias for `std::pair<int, int>`. Instead of using `pii`, it is better to use `std::pair<int, int>` directly to improve code readability.
3. The `maxLig` and `maxCol` constants are used to define the dimensions of the `grille` array. However, the actual number of rows and columns used in the `grille` array is specified by `nbLig` and `nbCol` variables. It would be more efficient to use these variables directly instead of using the constants.
4. The `grille` array is initialized with the value '~' using the `fill_n` function. However, this is not necessary as the array will be filled with the input values immediately after the initialization. Removing this initialization will improve efficiency.
5. The `proc` array is used to keep track of whether a cell has been processed or not. However, it is not necessary to initialize the entire array to 0 at the beginning of the program. Since the array is used as a flag, it can be initialized to a different value to indicate that a cell has not been processed. This will save memory and improve efficiency.
6. The `go` array is initialized with the value {0, 0} in some cases. However, this initialization is not necessary as the array will be filled with valid values during the execution of the program. Removing this initialization will save memory and improve efficiency.
7. The `comp` function is recursive and calls itself multiple times. This can lead to a large number of recursive calls and stack usage. This can be optimized by converting the recursive calls to iterative calls using a loop. This will reduce stack usage and improve efficiency.
8. The `getFin` function uses a while loop to iterate over the `go` array until it reaches a cell with the value '~'. This can be optimized by using a do-while loop instead. This will eliminate the need for an additional check at the beginning of the loop and improve efficiency.
9. The `blocRef` array is used to keep track of the block to which each row belongs. However, the array is not initialized before it is used. Initializing the array to -1 at the beginning of the program will prevent undefined behavior and improve correctness.
10. The `compBloc` function iterates over the rows in a block and calls the `comp` function for each cell. However, it is not necessary to call the `comp` function for each cell in the block. The `comp` function should only be called for cells that have not been processed yet. This can be optimized by keeping track of the cells that have already been processed and skipping them in the loop.
11. The main function reads the input, increments the `tps` variable, and then iterates over the requests. However, the `tps` variable is only used in the `comp` function. It is not necessary to increment the `tps` variable before each request. Instead, it can be incremented at the beginning of the `comp` function. This will simplify the code and improve efficiency.

2. Replace the `pii` alias with `std::pair<int, int>`.
3. Replace the usage of `maxLig` and `maxCol` constants with `nbLig` and `nbCol` variables.
4. Remove the unnecessary initialization of the `grille` array with the value '~'.
5. Initialize the `proc` array to a different value (e.g., -1) instead of 0.
6. Remove the unnecessary initialization of the `go` array with the value {0, 0}.
7. Convert the recursive calls in the `comp` function to iterative calls.
8. Replace the while loop in the `getFin` function with a do-while loop.
9. Initialize the `blocRef` array to -1 at the beginning of the program.
10. Optimize the `compBloc` function to skip cells that have already been processed.
11. Remove the unnecessary increment of the `tps` variable before each request in the main function.

Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. Replace the `using namespace std;` statement with explicit namespace specification:
   - This is done to avoid polluting the global namespace and improve code readability.
   - Replace `using namespace std;` with `using std::pair;` and `using std::cout;`.

2. Replace the `pii` alias with `std::pair<int, int>`:
   - This is done to improve code readability and make it clear that `pii` is a pair of integers.
   - Replace `pii` with `std::pair<int, int>`.

3. Replace the usage of `maxLig` and `maxCol` constants with `nbLig` and `nbCol` variables:
   - The `grille` array is defined with dimensions `maxLig` and `maxCol`, but the actual number of rows and columns used is specified by `nbLig` and `nbCol`.
   - Replace `grille[maxLig][maxCol]` with `grille[nbLig][nbCol]`.

4. Remove the unnecessary initialization of the `grille` array with the value '~':
   - The `grille` array is immediately filled with valid values from the input after the initialization.
   - Remove the line `fill_n(&grille[0][0], maxLig * maxCol, '~');`.

5. Initialize the `proc` array to a different value (e.g., -1) instead of 0:
   - The `proc` array is used as a flag to indicate whether a cell has been processed or not.
   - Initializing the array to a different value will allow us to distinguish between cells that have not been processed and cells that have been processed.
   - Replace `int proc[maxLig][maxCol];` with `int proc[maxLig][maxCol] = {-1};`.

6. Remove the unnecessary initialization of the `go` array with the value {0, 0}:
   - The `go` array will be filled with valid values during the execution of the program. There is no need to initialize it with a default value.
   - Remove the line `go[lig][col] = {0, 0};` from the `comp` function.

7. Convert the recursive calls in the `comp` function to iterative calls:
   - The `comp` function is currently implemented using recursion, which can lead to a large number of recursive calls and stack usage.
   - Convert the recursive calls to iterative calls using a loop.
   - Replace the `comp` function with the following optimized version:

```cpp
void comp(int lig, int col, int safeLig) {
  if (proc[lig][col] == tps)
    return;

  int nextLig, nextCol;
  while (true) {
    proc[lig][col] = tps;
    nextLig = lig;
    nextCol = col;

    if (grille[lig][col] == '<')
      --nextCol;
    else if (grille[lig][col] == '>')
      ++nextCol;
    else if (grille[lig][col] == '^')
      --nextLig;

    if (nextLig == safeLig || grille[nextLig][nextCol] == '~') {
      go[lig][col] = {nextLig, nextCol};
      break;
    } else if (grille[lig][col] != '^' && grille[lig][nextCol] != '^' &&
               grille[lig][col] != grille[lig][nextCol]) {
      go[lig][col] = {0, 0};
      break;
    } else {
      lig = nextLig;
      col = nextCol;
    }
  }
}
```

8. Replace the while loop in the `getFin` function with a do-while loop:
   - The `getFin` function currently uses a while loop to iterate over the `go` array until it reaches a cell with the value '~'.
   - Replace the while loop with a do-while loop to eliminate the need for an additional check at the beginning of the loop.
   - Replace the `getFin` function with the following optimized version:

```cpp
std::pair<int, int> getFin(int lig, int col) {
  std::pair<int, int> e;
  
  do {
    e = go[lig][col];
    lig = e.first;
    col = e.second;
  } while (grille[lig][col] != '~');

  return {lig, col};
}
```

9. Initialize the `blocRef` array to -1 at the beginning of the program:
   - The `blocRef` array is used to keep track of the block to which each row belongs.
   - Initialize the `blocRef` array to -1 at the beginning of the program to prevent undefined behavior.
   - Add the following line at the beginning of the `main` function: `std::fill_n(blocRef, maxLig, -1);`.

10. Optimize the `compBloc` function to skip cells that have already been processed:
    - The `compBloc` function currently calls the `comp` function for each cell in a block, even if the cell has already been processed.
    - Keep track of the cells that have already been processed and skip them in the loop.
    - Replace the `compBloc` function with the following optimized version:

```cpp
bool compBloc(int bloc) {
  int deb = bloc * sqr, fin = std::min(nbLig, (bloc + 1) * sqr);

  if (deb > nbLig)
    return false;

  for (int lig = deb + 1; lig <= fin; ++lig) {
    if (blocRef[lig] != bloc) {
      blocRef[lig] = bloc;

      for (int col = 1; col <= nbCol; ++col) {
        comp(lig, col, deb);
      }
    }
  }

  return true;
}
```

11. Remove the unnecessary increment of the `tps` variable before each request in the main function:
    - The `tps` variable is only used in the `comp` function. It is not necessary to increment it before each request.
    - Remove the line `++tps;` from the main loop in the `main` function.

Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <utility>
#include <algorithm>

const int maxLig = (1e5) + 5;
const int maxCol = 12;
const int maxReq = (1e5) + 5;
const int sqr = 600;

int nbLig, nbCol, nbReq;
char grille[maxLig][maxCol];
int proc[maxLig][maxCol];
int tps = 0;
std::pair<int, int> go[maxLig][maxCol];
int blocRef[maxLig];

void comp(int lig, int col, int safeLig) {
  if (proc[lig][col] == tps)
    return;

  int nextLig, nextCol;
  while (true) {
    proc[lig][col] = tps;
    nextLig = lig;
    nextCol = col;

    if (grille[lig][col] == '<')
      --nextCol;
    else if (grille[lig][col] == '>')
      ++nextCol;
    else if (grille[lig][col] == '^')
      --nextLig;

    if (nextLig == safeLig || grille[nextLig][nextCol] == '~') {
      go[lig][col] = {nextLig, nextCol};
      break;
    } else if (grille[lig][col] != '^' && grille[lig][nextCol] != '^' &&
               grille[lig][col] != grille[lig][nextCol]) {
