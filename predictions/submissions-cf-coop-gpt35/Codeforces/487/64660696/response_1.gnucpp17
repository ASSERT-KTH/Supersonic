This code is a C++ program that simulates the movement of a character on a grid. The grid is represented by a 2D array of characters, where each character represents a different type of movement. The program takes as input the dimensions of the grid, the initial configuration of the grid, and a series of movement requests. For each movement request, the program updates the grid and outputs the final position of the character.

Upon analyzing the code, I have identified several potential areas for optimization:

1. Redundant Computation: The `comp` function is called multiple times with the same arguments. This can result in redundant computations and unnecessary function calls.

2. Inefficient Data Structures: The `proc` array is used to keep track of the cells that have already been processed. However, this array is initialized to 0 at the beginning of the program and updated in the `comp` function. This results in unnecessary memory accesses and updates.

3. Unnecessary Recursion: The `comp` function is recursive, which can lead to a large number of function calls and stack usage. This can be replaced with an iterative approach to improve performance.

4. Inefficient Looping: The `compBloc` function uses nested `for` loops to iterate over the grid cells. This can be optimized by using a single loop and calculating the row and column indices based on the block number.

5. Lack of Compiler Optimizations: The code does not utilize any compiler optimizations or pragma directives that can hint the compiler to optimize certain parts of the code. Adding appropriate compiler optimizations can further improve performance.

Based on these observations, my optimization strategy is as follows:

1. Replace the `proc` array with a boolean array to reduce memory usage and improve cache performance.

2. Replace the recursive `comp` function with an iterative approach to eliminate unnecessary function calls and reduce stack usage.

3. Optimize the `compBloc` function by using a single loop and calculating the row and column indices based on the block number.

4. Add compiler optimizations or pragma directives to enable compiler optimizations.
