The provided code is a program that simulates the movement of a character on a grid based on the given input commands. The program uses a 2D array to represent the grid and performs a series of computations to determine the character's final position.

Upon analyzing the code, I have identified several potential areas for optimization:

1. Redundant Computations: The `comp` function is called multiple times with the same arguments, resulting in redundant computations. This can be optimized by storing the computed values in the `go` array and reusing them instead of recomputing them.

2. Unnecessary Memory Usage: The `go` array is of type `pair<int, int>`, which requires additional memory compared to storing the coordinates directly in the `proc` array. We can optimize memory usage by storing the coordinates directly in the `proc` array.

3. Inefficient Loop Structure: The `compBloc` function uses nested loops to iterate over the grid, which results in unnecessary iterations. We can optimize this by iterating over the grid in a linear manner, without the need for nested loops.

4. Compiler Optimization: We can suggest compiler optimizations, such as loop unrolling or vectorization, to further improve the performance of the code.
