The provided code is a C++ program that simulates movement on a grid. The program reads in the dimensions of the grid, the initial grid configuration, and a series of movement instructions. For each movement instruction, the program updates the grid configuration and outputs the final position after the movement.

Upon analysis, several potential optimizations can be identified:

1. Redundant Computations: The `comp` function is called multiple times for the same cell, which results in redundant computations. This can be optimized by introducing a memoization technique to store the results of previous computations for each cell.

2. Unnecessary Memory Usage: The `go` array is used to store the next position for each cell. However, it is only necessary to store the next position for cells that have a movement direction. Cells that do not have a movement direction can be set to {0, 0} to indicate that they are not part of any movement path.

3. Inefficient Looping: The `compBloc` function iterates over the entire grid for each block, even if the block does not cover the entire grid. This can be optimized by calculating the start and end indices for each block and only iterating over the cells within those indices.

4. Input/Output Overhead: The program uses standard input/output streams (`cin`/`cout`) for reading input and printing output. These operations can be slow, especially when there is a large amount of input/output. Using faster I/O methods, such as `scanf` and `printf`, can improve the overall performance.

Based on these observations, the following optimization strategy can be formulated:

1. Replace redundant computations in the `comp` function with memoization.
2. Modify the `go` array to store only the necessary next positions.
3. Optimize the `compBloc` function by calculating the start and end indices for each block.
4. Replace standard input/output streams with faster I/O methods (`scanf` and `printf`).
