The given code appears to be a program that simulates a grid-based game. The grid is represented by a 2D character array `grille`, and the program performs various operations on this grid based on user input.

Upon analyzing the code, the following potential areas for optimization can be identified:

1. Redundant Computations: The `comp` function is called multiple times for the same cell, resulting in redundant computations. This can be optimized by memoizing the results of previous computations.

2. Inefficient Data Structures: The use of a 2D character array for the grid (`grille`) and a 2D pair array for storing next positions (`go`) may not be the most efficient data structures. It may be beneficial to explore alternative data structures that can improve memory usage and access times.

3. Unnecessary Looping: The `compBloc` function loops through each block of the grid, even if the block has already been processed. This can be optimized by keeping track of the blocks that have already been processed.

4. Lack of Compiler Optimizations: The code does not currently include any compiler optimizations or pragma directives that can hint the compiler to optimize certain parts of the code. Adding appropriate compiler optimizations can potentially improve performance.

Based on these observations, the following optimization strategy can be formulated:

1. Replace the 2D character array `grille` with a more memory-efficient data structure, such as a 1D array or a bitset, depending on the characteristics of the game grid.

2. Replace the 2D pair array `go` with an alternative data structure that can store the next positions efficiently, such as a 1D array or a struct array.

3. Memoize the results of the `comp` function to avoid redundant computations.

4. Optimize the `compBloc` function to avoid unnecessary looping through already processed blocks.

5. Add appropriate compiler optimizations or pragma directives to hint the compiler to optimize certain parts of the code.

Now, let's proceed with the step-by-step optimization process.
