Code Analysis:
- The `read` function reads `n` integers from the input stream and stores them in a vector.
- The `solve` function takes two integers `n` and `m` as input and performs the following steps:
  1. Reads `n` integers and stores them in vector `v`.
  2. Initializes an empty set `s` and a counter `cont` to 0.
  3. Iterates over the elements of `v` in reverse order.
      - If the current element is not present in the set `s`, it is added to the set and the counter is incremented.
      - The current element in `v` is then updated with the value of the counter.
  4. Reads `m` integers from the input stream and for each integer `q`, prints the `q`th element of the updated `v` vector.
- The `main` function reads two integers `n` and `m`, disables synchronization with the C standard library, and calls the `solve` function.

Potential optimizations:
1. Avoid using `std::set` for duplicate detection: The use of a `std::set` to check for duplicates in each iteration can be time-consuming, especially for large inputs. We can optimize this by using a `std::unordered_set` instead, which has an average constant-time complexity for insertion and lookup operations.
2. Avoid unnecessary copying and resizing of the vector: The code currently stores the input values in a vector and later updates the vector with the counter values. This involves unnecessary copying and resizing of the vector. We can avoid this overhead by using a separate vector `result` to store the updated values, and only resize it once to the required size.
3. Optimize input/output operations: Disabling synchronization with the C standard library can improve the performance of input/output operations. Additionally, using `'\n'` instead of `std::endl` when printing the result can avoid the unnecessary flushing of the output buffer after each print statement.

Optimization steps:
1. Replace `std::set` with `std::unordered_set` for duplicate detection.
2. Create a separate vector `result` to store the updated values.
3. Use `'\n'` instead of `std::endl` when printing the result.
4. Disable synchronization with the C standard library.
