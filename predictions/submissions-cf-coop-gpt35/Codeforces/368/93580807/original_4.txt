Code Analysis:
1. The `read` function takes a vector by reference and reads input values into it. This is an efficient way to read input into a vector.
2. The `solve` function takes two integers `n` and `m`. It initializes a vector `v` of size `n`, reads `n` values into it using the `read` function, and then performs some computations on `v` to generate the output.
3. The `solve` function uses a set `s` to keep track of unique values encountered in the vector `v`. It also uses a variable `cont` to keep track of the number of unique values encountered so far.
4. The loop in the `solve` function iterates over the vector `v` in reverse order and checks if each element is present in the set `s`. If not, it inserts the element into the set and increments `cont`. It then updates the element in `v` with the value of `cont`.
5. Finally, the `solve` function reads `m` values from input and prints the corresponding elements from `v` based on the input values.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Since the `read` function is already efficient, we don't need to make any changes to it.
2. The main bottleneck in the code is the loop that iterates over the vector `v` in reverse order. The current implementation checks if each element is present in the set `s` using the `find` function, which has a complexity of O(log n) for sets.
3. We can optimize this by using an unordered_set instead of a set. The `find` operation in an unordered_set has an average complexity of O(1), which will significantly improve the performance of the code.
4. We can also optimize the loop that updates the elements in `v`. Instead of updating each element individually, we can use a variable to keep track of the maximum value encountered so far and update all elements in `v` to this maximum value in a single step.
5. There are no recursive calls or loops that can be optimized further.
6. We can add compiler optimizations by using pragma directives to hint the compiler to optimize the code.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Replace `set<int> s;` with `unordered_set<int> s;` to use an unordered_set instead of a set. This will improve the efficiency of the `find` operation.
2. Add a variable `max_val` before the loop that initializes `v`. Set `max_val` to 0 to keep track of the maximum value encountered so far.
3. Inside the loop that updates the elements in `v`, replace `v[i] = cont;` with `v[i] = max_val = max(max_val, cont);`. This will update the element in `v` and also update `max_val` to the maximum value encountered so far.
4. Add `#pragma GCC optimize("O3")` before the `main` function to enable compiler optimizations.

Optimized Code:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

void read(vector<int> &v) {
  for (auto &x : v)
    cin >> x;
}

void solve(int n, int m) {
  vector<int> v(n);
  read(v);
  unordered_set<int> s;
  int cont = 0;
  int max_val = 0;
  for (int i = v.size() - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
    if (s.find(v[i]) == s.end()) {
      s.insert(v[i]);
      cont++;
    }
    v[i] = max_val = max(max_val, cont);
  }
  int q;
  for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
    cin >> q;
    cout << v[q - 1] << endl;
  }
}

int main() {
  int n, m;
  ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  cout.tie(NULL);
  cin >> n >> m;
  #pragma GCC optimize("O3")
  solve(n, m);
}
```

The optimized code uses an unordered_set instead of a set for faster lookup. It also updates the elements in `v` in a more efficient way by keeping track of the maximum value encountered so far. Compiler optimizations are enabled using pragma directives.
