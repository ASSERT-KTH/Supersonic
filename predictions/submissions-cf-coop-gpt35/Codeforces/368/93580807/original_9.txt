Code Analysis:
- The code reads an integer `n` and `m` from the input.
- It then reads `n` integers into a vector `v`.
- It creates an empty set `s`, and initializes a counter `cont` to 0.
- It iterates over the elements of `v` in reverse order and checks if the element is already present in the set `s`.
- If the element is not present, it adds it to the set `s` and increments the counter `cont`.
- Finally, it reads `m` queries and prints the corresponding value from the `v` vector.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Use `reserve()` to allocate memory for the vector `v` upfront, since we know the size beforehand. This avoids unnecessary reallocations and improves performance.
2. Use an unordered set instead of a set to check for element existence. The average time complexity for finding an element in an unordered set is O(1) compared to O(log n) for a set.
3. Use a vector instead of a set to store the unique elements. This eliminates the need for searching the set for element existence and reduces memory usage.
4. Modify the loop that updates the values in the vector `v` to iterate in forward order instead of reverse order. This eliminates the need for indexing the vector in reverse and improves cache locality.
5. Use `reserve()` to allocate memory for the unordered set upfront, based on the expected number of unique elements.
6. Use `emplace_hint()` instead of `insert()` to insert elements into the unordered set. This can improve performance by providing a hint to the position where the element should be inserted.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Use `reserve()` to allocate memory for the vector `v` upfront. Since we know the size of the vector beforehand, we can avoid unnecessary reallocations as elements are added to the vector. Modify the `read()` function as follows:
```cpp
void read(vector<int> &v, int n) {
  v.reserve(n);
  for (auto &x : v)
    cin >> x;
}
```
2. Replace the `set<int>` with an `unordered_set<int>`. This change improves performance by reducing the time complexity of finding an element in the set from O(log n) to O(1). Modify the `solve()` function as follows:
```cpp
void solve(int n, int m) {
  vector<int> v(n);
  read(v, n);
  unordered_set<int> s;
  int cont = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    if (s.find(v[i]) == s.end()) {
      s.insert(v[i]);
      cont++;
    }
    v[i] = cont;
  }
  // Rest of the code remains unchanged
}
```
3. Change the loop that updates the values in the vector `v` to iterate in forward order instead of reverse order. This change eliminates the need for indexing the vector in reverse and improves cache locality. Modify the loop as follows:
```cpp
for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
  if (s.find(v[i]) == s.end()) {
    s.insert(v[i]);
    cont++;
  }
  v[i] = cont;
}
```
4. Use `reserve()` to allocate memory for the unordered set upfront, based on the expected number of unique elements. This avoids unnecessary reallocations and improves performance. Modify the `solve()` function as follows:
```cpp
void solve(int n, int m) {
  vector<int> v(n);
  read(v, n);
  unordered_set<int> s;
  s.reserve(n);
  int cont = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    if (s.find(v[i]) == s.end()) {
      s.insert(v[i]);
      cont++;
    }
    v[i] = cont;
  }
  // Rest of the code remains unchanged
}
```
5. Use `emplace_hint()` instead of `insert()` to insert elements into the unordered set. This can improve performance by providing a hint to the position where the element should be inserted. Modify the loop as follows:
```cpp
for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
  auto it = s.emplace_hint(s.end(), v[i]);
  if (it.second) {
    cont++;
  }
  v[i] = cont;
}
```

Optimized Code:
```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

void read(vector<int> &v, int n) {
  v.reserve(n);
  for (auto &x : v)
    cin >> x;
}

void solve(int n, int m) {
  vector<int> v(n);
  read(v, n);
  unordered_set<int> s;
  s.reserve(n);
  int cont = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    auto it = s.emplace_hint(s.end(), v[i]);
    if (it.second) {
      cont++;
    }
    v[i] = cont;
  }
  int q;
  for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
    cin >> q;
    cout << v[q - 1] << endl;
  }
}

int main() {
  int n, m;
  ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  cout.tie(NULL);
  cin >> n >> m;
  solve(n, m);
}
```
