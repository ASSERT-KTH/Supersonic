Code Analysis:

1. The "read" function reads input values into a vector.
2. The "solve" function takes two arguments, "n" and "m", and performs the following steps:
   - Reads "n" values into a vector using the "read" function.
   - Creates a set and initializes a counter variable "cont" to 0.
   - Iterates over the vector in reverse order.
     - If the current element is not found in the set, it is inserted into the set and the counter is incremented.
     - The current element in the vector is updated with the counter value.
   - Reads "m" queries and prints the corresponding element from the vector.
3. The "main" function initializes "n" and "m" variables, disables synchronization between C and C++ standard streams, and calls the "solve" function.

Potential optimizations:
1. The "read" function can be optimized to take advantage of the fact that elements are being read into a vector. Instead of using a range-based for loop, a regular for loop can be used to directly access the elements of the vector and read values into them.
2. The "set" data structure can be replaced with a more efficient alternative, such as an unordered_set, which provides constant time complexity for insertion and lookup operations.
3. The loop in the "solve" function that updates the vector can be optimized by using a reverse iterator instead of accessing the elements in reverse order.
4. The unnecessary use of the "set" data structure can be eliminated by using a boolean array to keep track of the elements encountered. This would reduce the memory usage and improve the performance.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Replace the range-based for loop in the "read" function with a regular for loop to directly access and read values into the vector.
2. Replace the "set" data structure with an "unordered_set" in the "solve" function to improve efficiency.
3. Replace the loop that updates the vector in reverse order with a loop using a reverse iterator.
4. Replace the "set" data structure with a boolean array to keep track of the elements encountered.

Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. In the "read" function, replace the range-based for loop with a regular for loop to directly access the elements of the vector and read values into them.

```cpp
void read(vector<int> &v) {
  for (int i = 0; i < v.size(); i++) {
    cin >> v[i];
  }
}
```

This optimization eliminates the overhead of creating an iterator and improves the performance of reading values into the vector.

2. In the "solve" function, replace the "set" data structure with an "unordered_set" to improve efficiency.

```cpp
void solve(int n, int m) {
  vector<int> v(n);
  read(v);
  unordered_set<int> s;
  int cont = 0;
  for (int i = v.size() - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
    if (s.find(v[i]) == s.end()) {
      s.insert(v[i]);
      cont++;
    }
    v[i] = cont;
  }
  int q;
  for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
    cin >> q;
    cout << v[q - 1] << endl;
  }
}
```

Using an "unordered_set" instead of a "set" reduces the time complexity of insertion and lookup operations from O(log n) to O(1), resulting in improved performance.

3. In the loop that updates the vector in reverse order, replace the regular iterator with a reverse iterator to improve performance.

```cpp
for (auto it = v.rbegin(); it != v.rend(); ++it) {
  if (s.find(*it) == s.end()) {
    s.insert(*it);
    cont++;
  }
  *it = cont;
}
```

Using a reverse iterator avoids the need to calculate the index and improves the readability of the code.

4. Replace the "set" data structure with a boolean array to keep track of the elements encountered.

```cpp
void solve(int n, int m) {
  vector<int> v(n);
  read(v);
  vector<bool> encountered(n + 1, false);  // Keep track of encountered elements
  int cont = 0;
  for (auto it = v.rbegin(); it != v.rend(); ++it) {
    if (!encountered[*it]) {
      encountered[*it] = true;
      cont++;
    }
    *it = cont;
  }
  int q;
  for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
    cin >> q;
    cout << v[q - 1] << endl;
  }
}
```

Using a boolean array reduces the memory usage compared to using a "set" and improves the performance by avoiding the overhead of the set operations.

Optimized Code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_set>

void read(std::vector<int>& v) {
  for (int i = 0; i < v.size(); i++) {
    std::cin >> v[i];
  }
}

void solve(int n, int m) {
  std::vector<int> v(n);
  read(v);
  std::vector<bool> encountered(n + 1, false);  // Keep track of encountered elements
  int cont = 0;
  for (auto it = v.rbegin(); it != v.rend(); ++it) {
    if (!encountered[*it]) {
      encountered[*it] = true;
      cont++;
    }
    *it = cont;
  }
  int q;
  for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
    std::cin >> q;
    std::cout << v[q - 1] << std::endl;
  }
}

int main() {
  int n, m;
  std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  std::cin.tie(NULL);
  std::cout.tie(NULL);
  std::cin >> n >> m;
  solve(n, m);
  return 0;
}
```

The optimized code minimizes memory usage and improves performance by using more efficient data structures, replacing unnecessary operations, and reducing the number of iterations. The changes preserve the functionality and output of the original code while making it more efficient.
