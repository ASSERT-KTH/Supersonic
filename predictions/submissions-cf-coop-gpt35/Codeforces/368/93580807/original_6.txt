The provided code is a C++ program that reads an integer `n` and `m` from the input, followed by a vector of integers `v` of size `n`. It then performs some calculations on `v` and outputs `m` values from `v` based on the input queries.

To optimize this code, we can focus on the following areas:

1. Input/Output Optimization: The code currently uses `cin` and `cout` for input and output operations. These operations are generally slower than other methods like `scanf` and `printf` in C++. We can replace the `cin` and `cout` calls with `scanf` and `printf` to improve the input/output performance.

2. Data Structure Optimization: The code uses a vector `v` to store the input values and a set `s` to keep track of unique elements. However, we can optimize the use of these data structures to reduce memory usage and improve performance.

3. Loop Optimization: The code uses a loop to iterate over the vector `v` and perform some calculations. We can explore loop unrolling and loop fusion techniques to optimize this loop.

Now, let's proceed with the optimization steps.
