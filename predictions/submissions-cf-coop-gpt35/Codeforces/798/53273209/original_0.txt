The given code takes an integer `n` as input, followed by `n` strings. It then calculates the minimum number of rotations required on each string to make all the strings equal. The output is the minimum number of rotations needed.

1. Code Analysis:
   - The code uses two vectors, `A` and `B`, to store the input strings and perform rotations respectively.
   - It iterates through each string in `A` and performs rotations on the strings in `B` until they become equal to the current string in `A`.
   - It keeps track of the minimum number of rotations required to make all the strings equal.

2. Optimization Strategy:
   - Replace the use of vectors with arrays to avoid dynamic memory allocation and deallocation overhead.
   - Use a more efficient approach to calculate the minimum number of rotations.
   - Optimize the inner loop to reduce unnecessary iterations.
   - Implement compiler optimizations to generate optimized code.

3. Step-by-Step Explanation:
   1. Replace vectors with arrays:
      - Replace `vector<string> B` with `string B[n]` and `vector<string> A` with `string A[n]`.
      - This avoids the overhead of dynamic memory allocation and deallocation when adding strings to vectors.
   2. Calculate the minimum number of rotations more efficiently:
      - Instead of comparing each string in `B` with the current string in `A`, we can calculate the minimum number of rotations for each string in `A` and find the overall minimum.
      - Initialize `ans` to `INT_MAX` instead of `1000001`.
      - Iterate over each string in `A` and calculate the number of rotations required to make all strings equal to it.
      - Update `ans` with the minimum number of rotations found so far.
   3. Optimize the inner loop:
      - Instead of rotating the strings character by character until they become equal, we can use a more efficient approach.
      - Calculate the number of rotations required to make the current string in `B` equal to the current string in `A` by finding the minimum number of rotations in both clockwise and counterclockwise directions.
      - Update `counter` with the minimum number of rotations found so far.
      - If the number of rotations exceeds 50, break the loop and return -1.
      - After the inner loop, update `ans` with the minimum value of `ans` and `counter`.
   4. Implement compiler optimizations:
      - Use compiler-specific optimizations like `-O3` or `-Ofast` to enable maximum optimization.
      - Use pragma directives like `#pragma GCC optimize("Ofast")` to hint the compiler to optimize the code further.

4. Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  cout.tie(NULL);

  int n;
  cin >> n;

  string B[n];
  string A[n];

  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> A[i];
  }

  if (n == 1) {
    cout << 0;
    return 0;
  }

  int ans = INT_MAX;

  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    int counter = 0;
    for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
      int rotations = 0;
      int len = A[i].length();
      if (B[j].length() != len) {
        cout << -1;
        return 0;
      }
      for (int k = 0; k < len; k++) {
        int clockwise = (B[j][k] - A[i][k] + 26) % 26;
        int counterclockwise = (A[i][k] - B[j][k] + 26) % 26;
        rotations += min(clockwise, counterclockwise);
        if (rotations > 50) {
          cout << -1;
          return 0;
        }
      }
      counter += rotations;
    }
    ans = min(ans, counter);
  }

  cout << ans;
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized code improves the performance by using arrays instead of vectors, calculating the minimum number of rotations more efficiently, and optimizing the inner loop. It also suggests using compiler optimizations to generate further optimized code.
