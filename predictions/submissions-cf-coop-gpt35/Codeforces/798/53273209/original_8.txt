The provided code calculates the minimum number of operations required to transform all strings in a given vector to a specific string. The current implementation uses a nested loop to iterate through all combinations of strings and characters, which results in a time complexity of O(n^3) and a space complexity of O(n^2), where n is the number of strings in the input.

To optimize the code, we can make the following improvements:

1. Inefficient data structure: The code uses two vectors, `A` and `B`, to store the input strings. However, we don't need to store the input strings in a separate vector `B` for each iteration. We can simply copy the input vector `A` and modify it in-place.

2. Redundant computations: The code performs unnecessary string operations in the inner loop. Instead of repeatedly erasing and appending characters to the strings, we can use modular arithmetic to determine the number of operations needed to transform one string into another.

3. Compiler optimizations: We can use compiler optimizations to improve the performance. For example, we can use the `-O3` flag to enable high-level optimization and inline function expansion.

Let's now optimize the code step by step:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  vector<string> A(n);
  
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> A[i];
  }

  if (n == 1) {
    cout << 0;
    return 0;
  }

  int ans = 1000001;
  
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    vector<int> operations(n);
    
    for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
      for (int k = 0; k < A[j].size(); k++) {
        int diff = A[j][k] - A[i][k];
        if (diff < 0) {
          diff += 26;
        }
        operations[j] += diff;
      }
    }

    int counter = *min_element(operations.begin(), operations.end());
    
    ans = min(ans, counter);
  }

  if (ans > 50) {
    cout << -1;
  } else {
    cout << ans;
  }

  return 0;
}
```

In the optimized code:

1. We removed the unnecessary `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` and replaced it with the necessary headers `<iostream>` and `<vector>`. It is generally not recommended to include the entire standard library using `bits/stdc++.h`.

2. We removed the synchronization calls `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false)`, `cin.tie(NULL)`, and `cout.tie(NULL)`. These calls are unnecessary for this code and can improve performance.

3. We replaced the vector `B` with a new vector `operations`, which will store the number of operations needed for each string.

4. We replaced the inner loop that performs string operations with a more efficient approach using modular arithmetic. The difference between the characters at each position is calculated and added to the respective element in `operations`.

5. We used the `min_element` algorithm to find the minimum number of operations in `operations` and assigned it to the `counter` variable.

6. We removed the `counter` initialization inside the outer loop to reduce redundant code.

7. We simplified the conditional statement to check if `ans` is greater than 50 and directly print the result accordingly.

By making these optimizations, we have reduced the time complexity to O(n^2) and the space complexity to O(n). We have also eliminated unnecessary string operations and improved the overall efficiency of the code.
