The provided code reads an integer `n` from the input and then reads `n` strings into a vector `A`. It then iterates over each string in `A` and rotates all the strings until they match the string at the current index. The number of rotations required to match all the strings with the current string is counted and the minimum count is printed as the output.

While the code works correctly, there are several areas where it can be optimized for efficiency:

1. Unnecessary `vector<string>`: The code uses two vectors, `A` and `B`, to store the strings. However, there is no need for two separate vectors. We can perform the rotations on `A` itself.

2. Unnecessary string copy: The code copies the strings from `A` to `B` for each iteration of the outer loop. This is an unnecessary overhead. Instead of copying, we can use the indices of `A` to access and modify the strings directly.

3. Redundant counter reset: The counter variable is reset to 0 for each iteration of the outer loop. However, we can simply initialize it to 0 before the loop and avoid the repeated reset.

4. Early termination: The code checks if `z` exceeds 50 for each iteration of the inner loop. However, we can move this check outside the inner loop and break the loop if `z` exceeds 50.

5. Optimized rotation: The current rotation logic involves repeatedly erasing the first character of the string and appending it to the end. This is an inefficient way to perform rotations. Instead, we can use a temporary string to store the rotated version of the string without repeatedly modifying the original string.
