Code Analysis:

1. The code uses preprocessor directives to define macros, such as `ll`, `rep`, `ref`, `endl`, `st`, `nd`, `pb`, `mp`, `mx`, and `inf`. These macros are used to simplify the code and improve readability.

2. The code uses an array `dp` to store the minimum number of operations required to make all numbers in the input array `a` even. The array `dp` has dimensions `200000` x `2`, which seems excessive considering the input constraint of `n + 24`. There may be an opportunity to optimize the memory usage here.

3. The code uses a function `gcd` to calculate the greatest common divisor of two numbers. The function uses a recursive approach to calculate the GCD, which may not be the most efficient method for large numbers.

4. The code uses a nested loop to initialize the `dp` array with the value `inf`. This operation is unnecessary since the array is already initialized with `inf` values when it is declared.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Replace the recursive `gcd` function with an iterative version to improve efficiency. This can be done by implementing the Euclidean algorithm, which is an efficient method for finding the GCD of two numbers.

2. Reduce the memory usage by resizing the `dp` array to the actual required size based on the input value `n`. This will avoid unnecessary memory allocation and improve efficiency.

3. Remove the unnecessary initialization of the `dp` array, as it is already initialized with `inf` values when declared.

4. Simplify the logic in the nested loop that calculates the values of the `dp` array. The current implementation has redundant conditions and multiple assignments, which can be simplified to improve efficiency.

Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. Replace the recursive `gcd` function with an iterative version to improve efficiency. Here's the optimized implementation of `gcd`:

```cpp
int gcd(int a, int b) {
  while (b != 0) {
    int temp = b;
    b = a % b;
    a = temp;
  }
  return a;
}
```

This implementation uses the Euclidean algorithm, which iteratively calculates the GCD by taking the remainder of the division `a % b` until `b` becomes zero.

2. Reduce the memory usage by resizing the `dp` array to the actual required size based on the input value `n`. Replace the declaration of `dp` with the following line:

```cpp
vector<vector<int>> dp(n + 2, vector<int>(2, inf));
```

This creates a 2D vector `dp` with dimensions `n + 2` x `2` and initializes all elements to `inf`.

3. Remove the unnecessary initialization of the `dp` array in the nested loop. The `dp` array is already initialized with `inf` values when declared, so the nested loop can be simplified as follows:

```cpp
for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
  if (a[i] % 2 and a[i + 1] % 2) {
    dp[i][0] = dp[i - 1][1];
    dp[i][1] = dp[i - 1][0] + 1;
  } else if (a[i] % 2 and a[i + 1] % 2 == 0) {
    dp[i][0] = dp[i - 1][1];
    dp[i][1] = dp[i - 1][0] + 2;
  } else if (a[i] % 2 == 0 and a[i + 1] % 2) {
    dp[i][0] = min(dp[i - 1][0], dp[i - 1][1]);
    dp[i][1] = min(dp[i - 1][1] + 2, dp[i - 1][0] + 2);
  } else if (a[i] % 2 == 0 and a[i + 1] % 2 == 0) {
    dp[i][0] = min(dp[i - 1][0], dp[i - 1][1]);
    dp[i][1] = dp[i][0];
  }
}
```

This simplification removes the redundant conditions and multiple assignments in the original code.

4. Update the output statement to use the resized `dp` array:

```cpp
if (inf == dp[n][0])
  cout << dp[n][1] << endl;
else
  cout << dp[n][0] << endl;
```

This ensures that the correct value is printed based on the updated size of the `dp` array.

Optimized Code:

Here's the complete optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

#define ll long long

int gcd(int a, int b) {
  while (b != 0) {
    int temp = b;
    b = a % b;
    a = temp;
  }
  return a;
}

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(0);

  ll n;
  cin >> n;
  vector<int> a(n + 24);
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
    cin >> a[i];
  }

  int faust = gcd(a[1], a[2]);
  for (int i = 3; i <= n; ++i) {
    faust = gcd(faust, a[i]);
  }

  vector<vector<int>> dp(n + 2, vector<int>(2, 2e9));
  if (faust > 1) {
    cout << "YES" << endl;
    cout << 0 << endl;
    return 0;
  }

  for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
    if (a[i] % 2 and a[i + 1] % 2) {
      dp[i][0] = dp[i - 1][1];
      dp[i][1] = dp[i - 1][0] + 1;
    } else if (a[i] % 2 and a[i + 1] % 2 == 0) {
      dp[i][0] = dp[i - 1][1];
      dp[i][1] = dp[i - 1][0] + 2;
    } else if (a[i] % 2 == 0 and a[i + 1] % 2) {
      dp[i][0] = min(dp[i - 1][0], dp[i - 1][1]);
      dp[i][1] = min(dp[i - 1][1] + 2, dp[i - 1][0] + 2);
    } else if (a[i] % 2 == 0 and a[i + 1] % 2 == 0) {
      dp[i][0] = min(dp[i - 1][0], dp[i - 1][1]);
      dp[i][1] = dp[i][0];
    }
  }

  cout << "YES" << endl;
  if (2e9 == dp[n][0])
    cout << dp[n][1] << endl;
  else
    cout << dp[n][0] << endl;

  return 0;
}
```

This optimized code should provide significant improvements in both performance and memory usage compared to the original code.
