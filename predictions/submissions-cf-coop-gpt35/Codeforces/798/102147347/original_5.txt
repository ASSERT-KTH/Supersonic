The provided code calculates the greatest common divisor (gcd) of a sequence of numbers and performs some computations based on the gcd value. The code also uses a dynamic programming approach to calculate the minimum number of operations required to transform the sequence of numbers.

Here are a few potential optimizations that can be applied to improve the efficiency of the code:

1. Avoid unnecessary function calls: 
   - The gcd function is called recursively, which can be inefficient for large input values. Instead, we can use the `__gcd` function from the `<numeric>` header, which is a more efficient alternative.
   - Additionally, the gcd function is called multiple times for the same pairs of numbers. We can optimize this by storing the gcd values in an array or vector and reusing them when needed.

2. Optimize memory usage:
   - The code uses a 2D array `dp` of size 200000x2 to store the minimum number of operations. However, the maximum value of `n` is given as `2e6`, which means we can reduce the memory usage by using a 1D array instead.

3. Simplify the logic:
   - The code contains multiple if-else conditions to handle different cases based on the parity of the numbers. We can simplify the logic by combining some of the conditions and reducing the number of if-else statements.

4. Use compiler optimizations:
   - We can use compiler optimizations to improve the performance of the code. For example, we can use optimization flags like `-O2` or `-O3` while compiling the code to enable optimization techniques like loop unrolling, function inlining, and constant propagation.

Now, let's go through each optimization step in detail:

1. Avoid unnecessary function calls:
   - Replace the `gcd` function with `__gcd` function from the `<numeric>` header.
   - Remove the unnecessary checks in the `gcd` function.

```cpp
#include <numeric> // add this header

// replace the gcd function with __gcd
int faust = a[1];
for (int i = 2; i <= n; ++i) {
  faust = __gcd(faust, a[i]);
}
```

2. Optimize memory usage:
   - Change the `dp` array to a 1D array of size `n + 2`.
   - Remove the initialization loop for `dp` array, as it will be initialized later in the code.

```cpp
int dp[mx]; // change the size to n + 2
```

3. Simplify the logic:
   - Combine some of the if-else conditions to reduce the number of branches.
   - Simplify the assignment of `dp[i][0]` and `dp[i][1]` values by using a temporary variable.

```cpp
for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
  int temp = min(dp[i - 1][0], dp[i - 1][1]);
  if (a[i] % 2) {
    if (a[i + 1] % 2) {
      dp[i][0] = dp[i - 1][1];
      dp[i][1] = temp + 1;
    } else {
      dp[i][0] = dp[i - 1][1];
      dp[i][1] = temp + 2;
    }
  } else {
    if (a[i + 1] % 2) {
      dp[i][0] = temp;
      dp[i][1] = temp + 2;
    } else {
      dp[i][0] = temp;
      dp[i][1] = temp;
    }
  }
}
```

4. Use compiler optimizations:
   - Use compiler optimization flags like `-O2` or `-O3` while compiling the code to enable optimization techniques.
   - For example, if you are using GCC, compile the code with `-O2` flag: `g++ -O2 -o program program.cpp`.

Here is the optimized code incorporating all the above optimizations:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
#define ll long long
#define rep(i, n) for (long long(i) = 0; (i) < (n); ++(i))
#define ref(i, a, b) for (long long(i) = (a); (i) <= (b); ++(i))
#define endl '\n'
#define st first
#define nd second
#define pb push_back
#define mp make_pair
const int mx = 2e6 + 5;
int inf = 2e9;
int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(0);
  ll n;
  cin >> n;
  vector<int> a(n + 24);
  rep(i, n) { cin >> a[i + 1]; }

  int faust = a[1];
  for (int i = 2; i <= n; ++i) {
    faust = __gcd(faust, a[i]);
  }

  a[n + 1] = 2;
  int dp[mx]; // change the size to n + 2
  dp[0] = 0;

  if (faust > 1) {
    cout << "YES" << endl;
    cout << 0 << endl;
    return 0;
  }

  for (int i = 1; i <= n + 2; ++i) {
    dp[i] = inf;
  }

  for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
    int temp = min(dp[i - 1], dp[i - 1] + 1);
    if (a[i] % 2) {
      if (a[i + 1] % 2) {
        dp[i] = dp[i - 1];
        dp[i] = temp + 1;
      } else {
        dp[i] = dp[i - 1];
        dp[i] = temp + 2;
      }
    } else {
      if (a[i + 1] % 2) {
        dp[i] = temp;
        dp[i] = temp + 2;
      } else {
        dp[i] = temp;
        dp[i] = temp;
      }
    }
  }

  cout << "YES" << endl;
  if (inf == dp[n])
    cout << dp[n] + 1 << endl;
  else
    cout << dp[n] << endl;
}
```
