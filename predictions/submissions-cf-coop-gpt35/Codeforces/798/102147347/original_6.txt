Upon analyzing the given code, I have identified several potential optimizations that can be made:

1. Remove unnecessary header inclusion: The code includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header, which is not a standard C++ header and is known to slow down compilation. Instead, we can include only the necessary standard headers, such as `<iostream>` and `<vector>`.

2. Remove unnecessary macros: The code defines several macros (`ll`, `rep`, `ref`, `endl`, `st`, `nd`, `pb`, `mp`) that are not used in the code. These macros can be safely removed.

3. Avoid excessive use of `std` namespace: The code uses the `std` namespace extensively, which can lead to potential name clashes and increase compile time. It is generally recommended to avoid importing the entire `std` namespace and instead use the `std::` prefix for specific standard library functions and types.

4. Optimize the `gcd` function: The `gcd` function is implemented recursively, which can result in unnecessary function calls and stack usage. We can optimize this function by implementing it iteratively using a loop. Additionally, we can remove the unnecessary checks for `a == b` and `a == 0` since they are already covered by the subsequent checks.

5. Optimize the initialization of the `dp` array: The `dp` array is initialized with a nested loop that sets every element to `inf`. This can be done more efficiently using the `std::fill` function.

6. Optimize the loop in the main algorithm: The loop in the main algorithm can be optimized by removing redundant checks and reducing the number of conditional statements. Additionally, we can use a temporary variable to reduce the number of array accesses.

7. Optimize the output code: The code checks if `inf` is equal to `dp[n][0]` to determine which value to output. We can optimize this by using the ternary operator to directly output the desired value.

Based on these optimizations, I will now provide an optimized version of the given code.
