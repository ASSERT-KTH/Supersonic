Code Analysis:
1. The code imports all standard libraries and defines several macros.
2. The code defines a `gcd` function to calculate the greatest common divisor of two numbers.
3. The code declares and initializes an array `dp` of size `200,000` to store the minimum number of operations required to make the given array of numbers even.
4. The code reads an integer `n` from the input and declares a vector `a` of size `n+24` to store the input numbers.
5. The code calculates the greatest common divisor `faust` of the first two numbers in the input array `a` and then iteratively calculates the greatest common divisor with the remaining numbers in the array.
6. The code sets the last element of the array `a` to `2` and initializes the first element of the `dp` array to `0` and the second element to a large value `inf`. It also initializes all other elements of the `dp` array to `inf`.
7. If the greatest common divisor `faust` is greater than `1`, the code outputs "YES" and `0` and exits.
8. The code then iterates from `1` to `n` and checks the parity of the current and next element in the array `a`. Based on the parity, it updates the `dp` array with the minimum number of operations required.
9. Finally, the code outputs "YES" and the minimum number of operations required, which is either the value at `dp[n][0]` or `dp[n][1]`.

Optimization Strategy:
1. The use of macros is unnecessary and can be replaced with inline functions or constants to improve code readability and avoid potential issues with macro expansion.
2. The `gcd` function can be optimized by using the Euclidean algorithm to calculate the greatest common divisor in a more efficient way.
3. The size of the `dp` array can be reduced by considering only the necessary elements. Since the array is accessed up to `n+2`, the size of the array can be reduced to `n+3`.
4. The initialization of the `dp` array can be done in a more efficient way by using `memset` or a nested loop.
5. The code can be optimized by eliminating redundant if conditions and unnecessary variable assignments.
6. The code can be further optimized by using a more efficient algorithm to calculate the minimum number of operations required.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Replace the macros with inline functions or constants to improve code readability and avoid issues with macro expansion. Replace the macros `rep`, `ref`, `st`, `nd`, `pb`, `mp`, and `endl` with their corresponding definitions or standard library equivalents.
2. Optimize the `gcd` function by using the Euclidean algorithm, which calculates the greatest common divisor in an efficient way. This will improve the performance of the function.
3. Reduce the size of the `dp` array from `200,000` to `n+3` to avoid unnecessary memory allocation.
4. Use `memset` or a nested loop to initialize the `dp` array instead of individually setting each element to `inf`. This will improve code readability and potentially improve performance.
5. Simplify the logic for updating the `dp` array by eliminating redundant if conditions and unnecessary variable assignments. This will make the code more concise and potentially improve performance.
6. Optimize the algorithm to calculate the minimum number of operations required by considering only the necessary cases and avoiding unnecessary calculations. This will further improve the performance of the code.

      dp[i][1] = min(dp[i - 1][1] + 2, dp[i - 1][0] + 2);

The optimized code retains the functionality and output of the original code while improving performance by eliminating redundant operations and using more efficient algorithms. The changes made are well-commented to highlight the optimizations and improve code understandability.
