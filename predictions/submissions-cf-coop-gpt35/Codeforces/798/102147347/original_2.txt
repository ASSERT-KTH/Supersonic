Code Analysis:
1. The code defines several macros, such as `ll`, `rep`, `ref`, `endl`, `st`, `nd`, `pb`, `mp`, `mx`, and `inf`. These macros are used for convenience and readability but do not have any direct impact on performance.

2. The `gcd` function calculates the greatest common divisor of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm. This function is called repeatedly in a loop, which suggests that it might be a potential performance bottleneck.

3. The code uses a 2D array `dp` to store intermediate results. The size of this array is `200000 x 2`. However, only a portion of this array is used, depending on the input size `n`. This inefficient memory usage can be optimized.

4. The code uses a loop to initialize the `dp` array with a large value `inf`. However, this can be done in a more efficient way.

5. The code has multiple conditional statements inside a nested loop, which can be simplified and optimized.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Replace the `gcd` function with a more efficient implementation, such as the binary GCD algorithm or the bitwise GCD algorithm. This will reduce the time complexity of calculating the greatest common divisor.

2. Optimize the memory usage by dynamically allocating the `dp` array based on the input size `n`. This will minimize unnecessary memory allocation and improve efficiency.

3. Replace the nested conditional statements with a more efficient and concise approach. Instead of using multiple if-else conditions, use bitwise operations or lookup tables to simplify the logic.

4. Use compiler optimizations, such as loop unrolling and pragma directives, to hint the compiler to optimize certain parts of the code. This can be done by enabling compiler optimizations, such as `-O3` flag for GCC or Clang.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Replace the `gcd` function with the binary GCD algorithm. This algorithm uses bitwise operations to calculate the greatest common divisor, which is more efficient than the Euclidean algorithm.

```cpp
int gcd(int a, int b) {
  if (a == 0)
    return b;
  if (b == 0)
    return a;

  int shift;
  for (shift = 0; ((a | b) & 1) == 0; ++shift) {
    a >>= 1;
    b >>= 1;
  }

  while ((a & 1) == 0)
    a >>= 1;

  do {
    while ((b & 1) == 0)
      b >>= 1;

    if (a > b)
      swap(a, b);

    b -= a;
  } while (b != 0);

  return a << shift;
}
```

This optimized `gcd` function reduces the number of operations required to calculate the greatest common divisor, resulting in improved performance.

2. Optimize the memory usage by dynamically allocating the `dp` array based on the input size `n`. This can be done using the `new` operator to allocate memory for the array.

```cpp
int** dp = new int*[n + 3];
for (int i = 0; i <= n + 2; ++i) {
  dp[i] = new int[2];
}
```

This optimized memory allocation ensures that only the required memory is allocated, reducing unnecessary memory usage.

3. Simplify and optimize the conditional statements inside the nested loop. Instead of using multiple if-else conditions, use bitwise operations and lookup tables to simplify the logic.

```cpp
int parity[2][2] = {{0, 2}, {1, 1}};
int minVal[2][2] = {{0, 1}, {1, 0}};

ref(i, 1, n) {
  int p1 = a[i] % 2;
  int p2 = a[i + 1] % 2;

  if (dp[i - 1][parity[p1][p2]] != inf) {
    dp[i][0] = dp[i - 1][parity[p1][p2]];
  }

  if (dp[i - 1][parity[p1][p2 ^ 1]] != inf) {
    dp[i][1] = dp[i - 1][parity[p1][p2 ^ 1]] + minVal[p1][p2];
  }
}
```

This optimized approach eliminates unnecessary conditional statements and replaces them with lookup tables, resulting in improved efficiency.

4. Enable compiler optimizations by adding compiler flags or pragma directives. For example, you can enable `-O3` optimization flag for GCC or Clang, or use `#pragma` directives to suggest optimizations to the compiler.

```cpp
#pragma GCC optimize("O3")
```

This pragma directive suggests the compiler to optimize the code for performance, which can result in further improvements.

    }

    if (dp[i - 1][parity[p1][p2 ^ 1]] != inf) {
      dp[i][1] = dp[i - 1][parity[p1][p2 ^ 1]] + minVal[p1][p2];
    }
  }

  cout << "YES" << endl;

  if (inf == dp[n][0]) {
    cout << dp[n][1] << endl;
  } else {

  }

  // Free allocated memory
