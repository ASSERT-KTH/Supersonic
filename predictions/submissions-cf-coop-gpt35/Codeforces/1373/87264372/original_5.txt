The given code seems to solve a dynamic programming problem. However, there are several areas where the code can be optimized for efficiency:

1. Unnecessary includes: The code includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header, which is not a standard C++ header and includes a large number of other headers. This can significantly increase the compilation time and may not be necessary for this specific program. We can replace it with the specific headers that are required.

2. Unnecessary compiler pragmas: The code includes several compiler pragmas to optimize the code. While these pragmas can potentially improve performance, they are not necessary for this specific program. We can remove them.

3. Excessive use of macros: The code defines several macros for common operations and constants. While macros can improve code readability, excessive use of macros can make the code harder to read and maintain. We can replace these macros with inline functions or constants.

4. Inefficient data structures: The code uses a vector of vectors (`vector<vll>`) to store the dynamic programming table. This can result in inefficient memory usage and slower access times. We can replace this data structure with a simple 2D array.

5. Redundant computations: The code computes the maximum value in each iteration of the outer loop, which results in redundant computations. We can instead compute the maximum value once after the loop.

6. Loop optimization: The code uses a range-based for loop (`REP`) to iterate over the elements of the input array. However, this loop creates a temporary copy of each element, which can be inefficient. We can replace this loop with a traditional index-based loop.

7. Magic numbers: The code uses several magic numbers, such as `3` and `2`, which make the code less readable and harder to understand. We can replace these magic numbers with named constants.

With these optimizations in mind, let's proceed with optimizing the code.
