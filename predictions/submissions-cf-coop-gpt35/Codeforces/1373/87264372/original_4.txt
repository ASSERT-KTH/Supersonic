Upon analyzing the provided code, I have identified the following potential optimizations:

1. Remove unnecessary `#include` statements: The code includes the entire `bits/stdc++.h` library, which is not recommended. It is better to include only the necessary headers.

2. Remove unnecessary preprocessor directives: The code includes pragma directives for compiler optimization. However, these directives may not have a significant impact on the performance of the given code, so they can be removed.

3. Avoid using `using namespace std;`: The code uses the `using namespace std;` statement, which imports the entire `std` namespace. This can lead to namespace conflicts and reduce code readability. It is better to use the `std::` prefix for standard library functions and objects.

4. Avoid unnecessary vector copies: The code creates a copy of the input vector `ar` using the `all()` function. However, this copy is not needed in the given code, so it can be removed.

5. Use `reserve()` for vectors: The code initializes the `dp` vector with a size of `(n + 1)`. However, since the size is known in advance, it is more efficient to use the `reserve()` function to pre-allocate memory for the vector.

6. Use integer types with appropriate sizes: The code uses `int` for loop counters and vector indices. However, since the input size `n` is of type `int`, it is more efficient to use `size_t` for loop counters and vector indices to avoid unnecessary type conversions.

7. Avoid unnecessary calculations and comparisons in loops: The code performs unnecessary calculations and comparisons in the loops. For example, `i & 1` is used multiple times to check if `i` is odd. These calculations can be moved outside the loop to reduce the number of operations.

8. Optimize the calculation of the maximum element: The code uses the `max()` function to calculate the maximum element among multiple values. However, this function has a higher overhead compared to manual comparison. It is more efficient to use a temporary variable to store the maximum value and update it if a larger value is found.

Based on these optimizations, the optimized code is as follows:
