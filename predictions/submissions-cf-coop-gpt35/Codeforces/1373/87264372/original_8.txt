Upon analyzing the provided code, several potential areas for optimization can be identified:

1. Unnecessary includes: The code includes the entire `<bits/stdc++.h>` header, which is a non-standard header and generally discouraged. Instead, we should include only the necessary headers.

2. Compiler pragmas: The code includes compiler pragmas to optimize the code. However, it is important to note that these pragmas may not have a significant impact on the performance of the code. We should consider removing them and rely on the compiler's default optimization settings.

3. Unnecessary macros: The code contains several macros that are not used in the provided code snippet. We should remove these unused macros to reduce clutter and improve code readability.

4. Redundant calculations: The code performs several redundant calculations in the loops. For example, in the inner loop, the code calculates `i & 1` multiple times, which can be avoided by storing the result in a variable.

5. Inefficient data structures: The code uses vectors of pairs (`vii` and `vlll`) to store data, which may result in unnecessary memory overhead. We can optimize this by using a single vector of pairs instead.

6. Magic numbers: The code uses magic numbers like `0` and `2` in multiple places. We should replace these magic numbers with named constants to improve code readability and maintainability.

Based on these observations, we can formulate the following optimization strategy:

1. Remove unnecessary includes, compiler pragmas, and unused macros.
2. Replace the magic numbers with named constants.
3. Optimize the redundant calculations in the loops.
4. Replace the inefficient data structures with more efficient alternatives.

Let's now proceed with the step-by-step explanation and provide the optimized code.
