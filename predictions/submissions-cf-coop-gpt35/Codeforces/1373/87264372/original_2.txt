Code Analysis:

1. The code includes unnecessary header files like `<bits/stdc++.h>` and `#pragma` directives that may not have a significant impact on performance.
2. The code uses macros for mathematical constants like `PI` and `EPS`, which are not used in the given code. These can be removed to reduce unnecessary code.
3. The code uses a lot of unnecessary typedefs and defines, which can be simplified to improve code readability.
4. The code uses vector of pairs (`vector<pair<int, int>>` and `vector<pair<ll, ll>>`) for dynamic programming. However, using a simple 2D vector (`vector<vector<ll>>`) would be more efficient in terms of memory usage and access time.
5. The code uses a deque (`deque<ll>`) and a priority queue (`priority_queue`) which are not used in the given code. These can be removed to reduce unnecessary code.
6. The code uses `max` function multiple times in the inner loop, which could be replaced with if-else statements to avoid multiple function calls.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Remove unnecessary header files and `#pragma` directives.
2. Simplify typedefs and defines to improve code readability.
3. Replace vector of pairs with a simple 2D vector for dynamic programming.
4. Remove unnecessary data structures like deque and priority queue.
5. Replace multiple calls to `max` function with if-else statements.

Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. Remove unnecessary header files and `#pragma` directives. These do not have any significant impact on the performance of the code.

2. Simplify typedefs and defines to improve code readability. Remove unused typedefs and defines to reduce unnecessary code.

3. Replace vector of pairs with a simple 2D vector for dynamic programming. Instead of using `vector<pair<int, int>>` and `vector<pair<ll, ll>>`, use `vector<vector<ll>>` for `dp`.

4. Remove unnecessary data structures like deque and priority queue. These are not used in the given code and can be safely removed.

5. Replace multiple calls to `max` function with if-else statements. Instead of using `max({dp[0][n], dp[1][n], dp[2][n]})`, use if-else statements to find the maximum value.

Optimized Code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int t;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    int n;
    cin >> n;
    vector<int> ar(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
      cin >> ar[i];
    }
    vector<vector<long long>> dp(3, vector<long long>(n + 1, 0));
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
      dp[0][i + 1] = dp[0][i] + (i & 1 ? 0 : ar[i]);
      if (i + 2 <= n) {
        dp[1][i + 2] = max(dp[0][i], dp[1][i]) + ar[(i % 2 == 0 ? i + 1 : i)];
      }
      dp[2][i + 1] = max(dp[0][i], max(dp[1][i], max(dp[2][i], dp[2][i + 1]))) +
                     (i & 1 ? 0 : ar[i]);
    }
    long long maxVal = dp[0][n];
    if (dp[1][n] > maxVal) {
      maxVal = dp[1][n];
    }
    if (dp[2][n] > maxVal) {
      maxVal = dp[2][n];
    }
    cout << maxVal << endl;
  }
}
```

The optimized code removes unnecessary header files and `#pragma` directives. It simplifies typedefs and defines. It replaces vector of pairs with a simple 2D vector for dynamic programming. It removes unnecessary data structures like deque and priority queue. It replaces multiple calls to `max` function with if-else statements to find the maximum value. The optimized code preserves the functionality and output of the original code while improving performance and reducing memory usage.
