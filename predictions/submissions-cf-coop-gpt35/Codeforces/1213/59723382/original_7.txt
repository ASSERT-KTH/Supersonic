Upon initial analysis of the code, the following potential optimizations can be identified:

1. Avoid unnecessary includes: The `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` includes a large number of standard library headers, which can slow down the compilation process. It is better to include only the necessary headers.

2. Avoid the use of `using namespace std`: This can lead to namespace collisions and make the code less maintainable. It is better to explicitly specify the namespace for each standard library function or object.

3. Avoid unnecessary modulo operations: The code performs modulo operations on several variables. Since the modulo base is a constant (`mod = 1e9 + 7`), the compiler can optimize these operations if we use the modulo base directly instead of taking the modulo at runtime.

4. Avoid unnecessary array accesses: The code uses a 2D array `v[20][20]` to store values. However, the array is sparsely populated, and most of its entries are not used. We can optimize memory usage by using a different data structure, such as a vector of pairs or a map, to store only the necessary entries.

5. Avoid unnecessary calculations: The code calculates `k` as `n / m` and then performs division and modulo operations on `k` multiple times. We can optimize this by calculating `k` once and reusing it as needed.

6. Avoid unnecessary loop iterations: The code uses a while loop to calculate values for the 2D array `v`. However, the loop always iterates `cnt` times, and the condition `_d != d` is not necessary. We can optimize this by using a for loop and iterating `cnt` times.

7. Avoid unnecessary additions: The code calculates the sum `o` by iterating over the 2D array `v` and adding its values. However, we can optimize this by calculating the sum directly using the formula `(cnt * (cnt + 1) / 2) * d`.

8. Use a more efficient algorithm for calculating the result: The code calculates the result by iterating over the 2D array `v` multiple times. We can optimize this by using a more efficient algorithm that calculates the result in a single pass.

Based on these optimizations, the optimized code is as follows:
