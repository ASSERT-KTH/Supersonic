The given code calculates the sum of digits in a repeating pattern for a given range of numbers. However, there are several areas where optimization can be applied to improve the efficiency of the code:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The code includes the entire `bits/stdc++.h` library, which is not required for this program. We can remove this include statement and only include the necessary headers.

2. Remove unnecessary calculations and variables:
    - The variable `k` represents the floor division of `n` by `m`, but it is not used in the calculations. We can remove this variable.
    - The variable `cnt` represents the number of elements in the repeating pattern, but it is not required. We can calculate the value of `cnt` on the fly instead of storing it in a variable.

3. Use modulus operator instead of repeated addition: The code calculates the next digit in the repeating pattern by repeatedly adding `d` and taking the modulus of 10. We can optimize this by using the modulus operator directly, which will reduce the number of iterations required.

4. Avoid unnecessary memory usage: The code uses a 2D array `v` to store the repeating pattern. However, this array is not required as we can calculate the sum of digits directly without storing the pattern in memory.

5. Use integer variables instead of long long: The code uses `long long` for variables that can be safely represented by `int`. Using `int` instead of `long long` can reduce memory usage and improve performance.

Based on these observations, let's optimize the code step by step:
