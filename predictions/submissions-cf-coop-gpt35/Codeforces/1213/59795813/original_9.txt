Code Analysis:
- The code implements a disjoint-set union (DSU) data structure to calculate the sum of weights of edges in a minimum spanning tree.
- The code reads input values for n (number of nodes) and m (number of queries).
- It then reads n-1 edges, represented by three integers u, v, and w (the nodes and weight of the edge).
- The edges are stored in a vector e, which is sorted in ascending order based on the edge weights.
- The DSU algorithm is applied to calculate the sum of weights of edges in the minimum spanning tree.
- Finally, the code reads m query values and outputs the corresponding sums from the DSU algorithm.

Potential Performance Bottlenecks:
1. Sorting the edges: The edges are sorted using the `sort` function, which has a time complexity of O(nlogn). This can be a potential bottleneck if the number of edges is large.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Use a faster sorting algorithm: Replace the `sort` function with a faster sorting algorithm, such as quicksort or mergesort.
2. Reduce memory usage: The `e` vector stores all the edges, which can consume a significant amount of memory. Instead of storing the entire edge, we can store only the indices of the nodes and the weight separately, reducing memory usage.
3. Avoid unnecessary function calls: The `root` function is called multiple times within the `mrg` function. We can optimize this by storing the root values in variables and reusing them.
4. Optimize DSU loop: The DSU loop in the `dsu` function can be optimized to avoid calculating `sz[x] + sz[y]` in each iteration.
5. Use a faster input/output mechanism: Replace the `cin` and `cout` functions with faster input/output mechanisms, such as `scanf` and `printf`.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Replace the `sort` function with a faster sorting algorithm, such as quicksort or mergesort. In this case, we can use the `sort` function as it provides a reasonable time complexity for the given size of the input.
2. Replace the `vector<pair<int, pii>> e` with two separate vectors: `vector<int> u` and `vector<int> v`, to store the indices of the nodes, and `vector<int> w` to store the weights. This reduces memory usage as we no longer need to store the entire edge as a pair.
3. Modify the `root` function to store the root value in a variable and update the parent array directly.
4. Modify the `mrg` function to avoid calculating `sz[x] + sz[y]` in each iteration. Instead, calculate the sum once and store it in a variable.
5. Replace the `cin` and `cout` functions with `scanf` and `printf` for faster input/output.
