The given code appears to be solving a graph problem using the Disjoint Set Union (DSU) data structure. However, there are several potential areas for optimization:

1. Unnecessary Header Inclusion: The code includes the entire `bits/stdc++.h` header, which is not recommended as it slows down the compilation process. Instead, we should include only the necessary headers.

2. Preprocessor Definitions: The code uses several preprocessor definitions (`pb`, `F`, `S`, `gcd`, `int`, `err`). While these provide convenience, they can make the code harder to read and understand. It is better to avoid using such definitions and instead write the code in a clear and readable manner.

3. Inefficient Data Structures: The code uses vectors and maps to store and process data. However, vectors have a dynamic size that can result in frequent memory allocations and deallocations, impacting performance. Similarly, maps have an O(log N) time complexity for most operations. We can consider using arrays instead of vectors and unordered_maps instead of maps, as they have constant-time complexity for most operations.

4. Inefficient Sorting: The code sorts the vector `e` using the `sort()` function. However, the sorting can be optimized by using a counting sort or radix sort algorithm, as the values in `w` are within the range [1, MAX].

5. Redundant Loop Iterations: The loop in the `dsu()` function iterates `n-1` times, even though the vector `e` contains exactly `n-1` elements. We can simplify the loop to iterate over `e` directly.

6. Unnecessary Loop Initialization: The loop in the `dsu()` function initializes the `PS` array for all values up to `MAX`. However, the `PS` array is only used up to `n`, so we can avoid initializing unnecessary elements.

7. Inefficient Union-Find Implementation: The `root()` and `mrg()` functions use a simple union-find implementation. However, we can optimize these functions to achieve better performance by using path compression and union by rank heuristics.

8. Input/Output Optimization: The code uses `cin` and `cout` for input/output operations, which can be slower compared to other methods like `scanf` and `printf`. We can consider using these alternatives for faster input/output.

Based on these observations, let's proceed with optimizing the given code.
