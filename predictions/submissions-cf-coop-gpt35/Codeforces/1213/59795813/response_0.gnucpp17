The given code appears to be implementing a disjoint set union (DSU) data structure to solve a graph problem. The code reads an input graph, calculates the sum of weights of all edges in the connected components of the graph, and then answers a series of queries by outputting the sum of weights up to a certain vertex.

Upon analyzing the code, several potential optimizations can be identified:

1. **Unnecessary includes**: The code includes the entire `bits/stdc++.h` header, which is not recommended as it slows down the compilation process. Instead, we should include only the necessary headers, such as `<iostream>`, `<vector>`, `<map>`, and `<algorithm>`.
   
2. **Unnecessary macros**: The code defines several macros (`pb`, `F`, `S`, `gcd`, `int`, `err`) that are not used. These macros can be removed to improve code readability.

3. **Inefficient sorting**: The code sorts the edges of the graph using `std::sort()`. However, the sorting is not necessary for the functionality of the program. Removing the sorting step can significantly improve the running time.

4. **Inefficient union operation**: The `mrg()` function performs the union operation between two sets using the weighted union heuristic. However, it also performs unnecessary root calculations and swaps. By simplifying the `mrg()` function, we can improve its efficiency.

5. **Inefficient data structure**: The code uses an array `PS` to store the prefix sum of the weights. However, the array is initialized with a size of `MAX` (which is 2e5) and is accessed up to `n-1` (where `n` is the number of vertices in the graph). This leads to unnecessary memory usage. We can optimize this by using a `std::vector` instead of a fixed-size array.

To optimize the code, the following steps can be taken:

1. Remove unnecessary includes and macros.
2. Simplify the `mrg()` function to improve its efficiency.
3. Remove the sorting step as it is not necessary for the program's functionality.
4. Replace the array `PS` with a `std::vector` to optimize memory usage.
5. Provide step-by-step explanations for each optimization step.
