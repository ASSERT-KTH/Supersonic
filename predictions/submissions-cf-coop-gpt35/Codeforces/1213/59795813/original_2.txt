Upon analyzing the given code, the following potential areas for optimization can be identified:

1. Redundant includes: The code includes the entire `bits/stdc++.h` library, which is not recommended. Instead, only the necessary standard libraries should be included.

2. Excessive use of macros: The code uses macros excessively, which can make the code less readable and harder to debug. It is recommended to replace the macros with proper function or variable definitions.

3. Unnecessary use of `typedef`: The code uses `typedef` for defining `pii`, `vi`, and `mi`, which can be replaced with explicit type declarations.

4. Inefficient data structures: The code uses a `vector<pair<int, pii>>` to store the edges, which is not an efficient data structure for this task. A more efficient alternative would be to use a `vector<pair<int, pair<int, int>>>` or a custom class to represent the edges.

5. Inefficient union-find implementation: The union-find implementation in the code can be further optimized by using path compression and union by rank heuristics.

6. Inefficient prefix sum calculation: The prefix sum calculation in the `dsu()` function can be optimized to reduce the number of operations.

7. Unnecessary loop iterations: The loop in the `dsu()` function iterates `n-1` times, which can be simplified to iterate `n` times.

Based on these observations, the following optimization strategy can be formulated:

1. Replace the excessive macros with proper function or variable definitions.
2. Replace the `typedef` statements with explicit type declarations.
3. Replace the `vector<pair<int, pii>>` with a more efficient data structure, such as `vector<pair<int, pair<int, int>>>` or a custom class.
4. Optimize the union-find implementation by using path compression and union by rank heuristics.
5. Optimize the prefix sum calculation in the `dsu()` function.
6. Simplify the loop in the `dsu()` function to iterate `n` times.

Now, let's proceed with the step-by-step explanation of each optimization and provide the optimized code block.
