The given code is an implementation of a disjoint set union algorithm. The algorithm calculates the sum of weights of all edges in the path from a node to the root of its connected component. The program takes an input `n` which represents the number of nodes, and an input `m` which represents the number of queries. For each query, it takes an input `q` which represents a node and outputs the sum of weights of all edges in the path from that node to the root.

Upon analyzing the code, I have identified several potential areas for optimization:

1. Unnecessary includes: The code includes the entire `bits/stdc++.h` header, which is known to slow down compilation times. It is recommended to include only the necessary standard library headers instead of using the entire header.

2. Redundant macros: The code defines several macros (`pb`, `F`, `S`, `gcd`, `int`, `err`) that are not used in the given code. These macros should be removed to improve code readability.

3. Inefficient data structures: The code uses a vector of pairs `e` to store the edges, and a map `PS` to store the prefix sums. However, using a vector of pairs for edges and a map for prefix sums may not be the most efficient data structures for this problem. A more efficient alternative would be to use arrays instead of vectors and maps, as arrays have a constant time complexity for access and update operations.

4. Inefficient sorting: The code uses the `sort` function to sort the edges based on their weights. However, using a custom sorting function can improve performance by avoiding the overhead of calling the comparison function for each comparison. This can be achieved by using the `std::sort` function with a lambda function as the comparison function.

5. Inefficient union operation: The `mrg` function performs the union operation by merging two components. However, the function has a time complexity of O(log n) due to the `root` function being called twice. This can be optimized by using a technique called path compression, which reduces the height of the tree by making every other node point to its grandparent.

6. Unnecessary loop iterations: The `dsu` function iterates over the edges from 0 to `n - 1`. However, it should iterate from 0 to `n - 2` because there are `n - 1` edges in total.

To optimize the code, I propose the following steps:

Step 1: Remove unnecessary includes and macros:
- Remove the `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` line.
- Remove the unnecessary macros `pb`, `F`, `S`, `gcd`, `int`, and `err`.

Step 2: Replace inefficient data structures:
- Replace the vector of pairs `e` with two arrays `int u[MAX], v[MAX], w[MAX]` to store the edges.
- Replace the map `PS` with an array `int PS[MAX]` to store the prefix sums.

Step 3: Optimize the sorting operation:
- Replace the `sort` function with `std::sort` and use a lambda function as the comparison function. This can be done as follows:
  ```cpp
  sort(e, e + n - 1, [](const pair<int, pii>& a, const pair<int, pii>& b) {
    return a.F < b.F;
  });
  ```

Step 4: Optimize the union operation:
- Modify the `root` function to use path compression. This can be done by updating the parent of each node to its root during the find operation.
  ```cpp
  int root(int x) {
    if (par[x] != x) {
      par[x] = root(par[x]);
    }
    return par[x];
  }
  ```

Step 5: Optimize the loop iterations:
- Modify the loop in the `dsu` function to iterate from 0 to `n - 2` instead of `n - 1`.
