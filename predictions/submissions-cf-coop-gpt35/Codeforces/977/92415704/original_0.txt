The provided code is an implementation of a graph traversal algorithm using breadth-first search (BFS). The algorithm counts the number of connected components in the graph where each component has the property that the number of nodes is equal to the number of edges.

Here is the step-by-step optimization strategy for the given code:

1. Avoid using the `bits/stdc++.h` header: The `bits/stdc++.h` header is not a standard C++ header and is not recommended to be used in production code. Instead, include only the necessary headers, such as `<iostream>`, `<vector>`, `<queue>`, and `<cstdio>`.

2. Avoid using global variables: The variables `nn` and `ne` are only used within the `bfs` function. It is better to pass them as arguments and return them from the function instead of using global variables.

3. Use `const` and references where appropriate: In the `bfs` function, the loop variable `i` can be declared as `const int&` to avoid unnecessary copies. Similarly, the `u` parameter can be passed as a const reference (`const int& u`) since it is not modified within the function.

4. Use range-based for loop: Instead of using the index-based loop (`for (int i = 0; i < (int)v[u].size(); i++)`), use a range-based for loop (`for (int p : v[u])`) to iterate over the elements of `v[u]`.

5. Use `emplace_back` instead of `push_back`: Instead of using `push_back` to add elements to the vector `v[u]`, use `emplace_back` to construct the elements in-place, avoiding unnecessary copies.

6. Replace `scanf` and `printf` with `cin` and `cout`: The code currently uses `scanf` and `printf` for input and output. It is recommended to use `cin` and `cout` instead, as they provide a safer and more convenient way to handle input and output in C++.

7. Use a `vector<bool>` instead of `bool[]` for `vis`: The array `vis` is used as a boolean array to mark visited nodes. Using `vector<bool>` instead of `bool[]` can save memory space.

8. Use `reserve` for `vector`: Since the size of vector `v` is known in advance, it is better to use `reserve` to allocate memory for the vector, avoiding unnecessary reallocations.

Now, let's apply these optimizations to the code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <queue>

using namespace std;

void bfs(const vector<vector<int>>& v, vector<bool>& vis, int& nn, int& ne, int u) {
  nn = 0;
  ne = 0;
  vis[u] = true;
  queue<int> q;
  q.push(u);
  while (!q.empty()) {
    u = q.front();
    q.pop();
    nn++;
    if (v[u].size() == 2)
      ne++;
    vis[u] = true;
    for (int p : v[u]) {
      if (!vis[p]) {
        vis[p] = true;
        q.push(p);
      }
    }
  }
}

int main() {
  int n, m, a, b, c = 0;
  cin >> n >> m;
  
  vector<vector<int>> v(n + 1);
  vector<bool> vis(n + 1, false);
  
  while (m--) {
    cin >> a >> b;
    v[a].emplace_back(b);
    v[b].emplace_back(a);
  }
  
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    if (!vis[i]) {
      int nn, ne;
      bfs(v, vis, nn, ne, i);
      if (nn == ne)
        c++;
    }
  }
  
  cout << c << endl;
  
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized code retains the functionality and output of the original code while improving performance and minimizing memory usage.
