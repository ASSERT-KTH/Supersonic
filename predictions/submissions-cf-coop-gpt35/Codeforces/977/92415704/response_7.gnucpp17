The given code appears to be solving a graph problem using breadth-first search (BFS). However, there are several areas where the code can be optimized:

1. Unnecessary includes: The line `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` includes all standard library headers, which is unnecessary and can increase compile time. It is better to include only the necessary headers.

2. Inefficient data structure: The code uses a vector of vectors (`vector<int> v[200010]`) to represent the graph. This can be memory-intensive and slow for large graphs. A more efficient alternative is to use an adjacency list, where each node is represented by a vector containing its neighbors.

3. Redundant variable assignments: The variables `nn` and `ne` are assigned the value of 0 at the beginning of each BFS iteration. This is unnecessary since they are immediately overwritten inside the loop.

4. Redundant checks: The line `vis[u] = true;` is redundant because `vis[u]` is already set to true at the beginning of the BFS.

5. Inefficient loop iteration: The loop `for (int i = 0; i < (int)v[u].size(); i++)` iterates over the vector `v[u]` using the `size()` function in each iteration. It is more efficient to calculate the size once before the loop and store it in a variable.

6. Unnecessary variable assignment: The line `vis[p] = 1;` can be replaced with `vis[p] = true;` for clarity.

7. Input/output functions: The code uses `scanf` and `printf` for input and output, respectively. While these functions are fast, they can be replaced with C++ iostreams (`cin` and `cout`) for a more modern and safer approach.
