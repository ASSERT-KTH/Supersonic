After analyzing the provided code, I have identified several potential optimizations that can be made:

1. Inefficient Input: The current implementation uses the `std::cin` function to read input values one by one. This can be slow and inefficient, especially when dealing with large input sizes. An alternative approach is to use `std::istream::read` to read the entire input buffer at once.

2. Unnecessary Memory Usage: The code uses a vector `a` to store the input values, but it does not use the vector for anything other than accessing the values one by one. This is unnecessary and inefficient in terms of memory usage. We can replace the vector with a single variable to store the current value being read.

3. Redundant Loop: The current implementation uses two nested loops to iterate over the input values and check for a specific condition. However, the nested loop is unnecessary and can be replaced with a single loop.

4. Early Return: The code uses a return statement inside the loop to exit early when a condition is met. This can be optimized by using a flag variable to track the condition and breaking out of the loop instead of returning immediately.
