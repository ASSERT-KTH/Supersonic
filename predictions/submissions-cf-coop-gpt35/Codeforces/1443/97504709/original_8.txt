Code Analysis:
- The code reads a number of test cases and for each test case, it reads the size of an array `n` and the elements of the array `a`.
- The `solve` function takes the array `a` as input and checks if it is possible to make all elements of the array equal by repeatedly subtracting the smallest element from each element.
- The `answer` function prints "YES" if it is possible to make all elements equal and "NO" otherwise.
- The `test_case` function reads the input for a single test case and calls the `solve` function.
- The `main` function reads the number of test cases and calls the `test_case` function for each test case.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Use a more efficient data structure: Instead of using a `std::vector` to store the elements of the array `a`, we can use a dynamically allocated array (`new[]`) to reduce memory overhead and improve cache locality.
2. Avoid unnecessary function calls: The `answer` function can be replaced with a simple `std::cout` statement to avoid the function call overhead.
3. Optimize the inner loop in the `solve` function: The current implementation has a nested loop that iterates over all elements of the array for each element. This can be optimized by keeping track of the minimum element and its index, and then subtracting it from all elements in a single loop.
4. Use compiler optimizations: We can enable compiler optimizations by using `-O2` flag during compilation.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Replace `std::vector<unsigned> a(n);` with `unsigned* a = new unsigned[n];` to use a dynamically allocated array instead of a `std::vector`. This reduces memory overhead and improves cache locality. Also, replace `std::cin >> a;` with a loop to read the elements of the array using `std::cin >> a[i];`.
2. Replace `void answer(bool v)` with `#define answer(v) std::cout << ((v) ? "YES\n" : "NO\n");` to avoid the function call overhead.
3. Replace the nested loop in the `solve` function with a single loop that keeps track of the minimum element and its index. After finding the minimum element, subtract it from all elements in a single loop. This reduces the number of iterations and improves performance.
4. Enable compiler optimizations by adding `-O2` flag during compilation.

Optimized Code:
```cpp
#include <iostream>

template <typename T>
std::istream& operator>>(std::istream& input, T* a) {
    input >> *a;
    return input;
}

#define answer(v) std::cout << ((v) ? "YES\n" : "NO\n");

void solve(unsigned* a, size_t n) {
    unsigned min_val = a[0];
    size_t min_index = 0;

    for (size_t i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
        if (a[i] < min_val) {
            min_val = a[i];
            min_index = i;
        }
    }

    for (size_t i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        if (i != min_index && a[i] < min_val) {
            answer(false);
            return;
        }
        a[i] -= min_val;
    }

    answer(true);
}

void test_case() {
    size_t n;
    std::cin >> n;

    unsigned* a = new unsigned[n];
    for (size_t i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        std::cin >> a[i];
    }

    solve(a, n);

    delete[] a;
}

int main() {
    size_t t;
    std::cin >> t;

    while (t-- > 0) {
        test_case();
    }

    return 0;
}
```

This optimized code reduces memory overhead by using a dynamically allocated array instead of a `std::vector`. It avoids unnecessary function calls by using a `#define` macro. It optimizes the inner loop in the `solve` function to reduce the number of iterations. Finally, it suggests enabling compiler optimizations using the `-O2` flag during compilation.
