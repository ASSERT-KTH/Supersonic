Upon analysis of the provided code, I have identified several areas that can be optimized for efficiency:

1. Use of "bits/stdc++.h": The inclusion of `bits/stdc++.h` is not recommended as it includes a large number of unnecessary header files, which can lead to increased compile times and unnecessary memory usage. It is more efficient to include only the necessary header files.

2. Redundant Pair Assignment: In the first loop, the pairs in the `vec` vector are assigned twice, which is unnecessary. We can assign the pairs directly with the second value.

3. Unnecessary Sorting: The `vec` vector is sorted unnecessarily. Sorting the vector is not required to calculate the minimum value. We can optimize this step by removing the sorting operation.

4. Redundant Loop for Total Sum: The third loop is used to calculate the total sum of the second values in the vector. However, we can calculate the total sum as we calculate `timeSum`.

5. Unnecessary Map Usage: The `timeSum` map is used to store the sum of the second values for each unique first value. However, we can achieve the same result using a simple array or vector, which will be more efficient in terms of both memory usage and access time.

6. Unnecessary Conditional Check: In the last loop, the condition `if (i > 0 && vec[i].first == vec[i - 1].first)` is used to skip the loop iteration if the current element has the same first value as the previous one. However, since the vector is sorted, we can remove this condition and directly access the unique first values.

Based on these observations, I will now provide an optimized version of the code.
