The given code is a C++ program that calculates and prints the number of subarrays in a given string that have an equal number of 0s and 1s. The program uses a map to keep track of the count of prefix sums, and a loop to iterate through the input string and update the prefix sum count.

To optimize this code, we can focus on the following areas:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The code includes unnecessary headers, such as `<bits/stdc++.h>` and `<ext/pb_ds/assoc_container.hpp>`. We can remove these includes as they are not used in the code.

2. Remove unnecessary macros: The code defines several macros that are not used. We can remove these macros to simplify the code.

3. Improve data structure efficiency: The code uses a `map` to keep track of the count of prefix sums. However, a `map` has a higher time complexity for insertion and lookup operations compared to other data structures like `unordered_map` or a simple array. We can replace the `mii` map with a simple array to improve the efficiency.

4. Avoid unnecessary calculations: The code calculates the prefix sum at each iteration and then subtracts the current index to get the prefix sum difference. Instead, we can calculate the prefix sum difference directly without calculating the prefix sum.

With these optimizations in mind, here's the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(NULL);
    cout.tie(NULL);
    
    int t;
    cin >> t;
    
    while (t--) {
        int n;
        cin >> n;
        string s;
        cin >> s;

        unordered_map<int, int> cnt;
        cnt[0] = 1;
        int pre = 0;
        int ans = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            int d = s[i] - '0';
            pre += (d == 1 ? 1 : -1);
            ans += cnt[pre];
            cnt[pre]++;
        }

        cout << ans << endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

Let's go through the optimizations step by step:

1. Removed unnecessary includes: The unnecessary includes `<bits/stdc++.h>` and `<ext/pb_ds/assoc_container.hpp>` have been removed.

2. Removed unnecessary macros: The unnecessary macros have been removed to simplify the code.

3. Improved data structure efficiency: The `mii` map has been replaced with an `unordered_map<int, int>` for improved efficiency.

4. Avoided unnecessary calculations: The prefix sum calculation has been simplified to directly calculate the prefix sum difference without calculating the prefix sum at each iteration.

These optimizations significantly improve the efficiency of the code while preserving the functionality and output of the original code.
