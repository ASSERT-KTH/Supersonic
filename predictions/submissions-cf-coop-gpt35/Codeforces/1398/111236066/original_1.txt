The given code appears to solve a problem by counting the number of subarrays in a string that have an equal number of 0s and 1s. Here are some potential optimizations that can be applied to improve the performance of the code:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The code includes some unnecessary headers such as `<bits/stdc++.h>` and `<ext/pb_ds/assoc_container.hpp>`. These can be removed as they are not used in the code.

2. Avoid using `using namespace std;`: While it makes the code shorter, it can lead to naming conflicts and make the code harder to understand. Instead, use the `std::` prefix when referencing standard library functions and objects.

3. Avoid using macros: Macros can make the code harder to read and debug. Instead, use constant variables or inline functions.

4. Avoid unnecessary data structures: The code uses a `map` to keep count of the frequency of specific values. However, we can optimize this by using an array instead of a map. Since the values are limited to 0 and 1, we can use a simple array of size 2 to keep track of the frequencies.

5. Simplify the prime checking function: The function `isPrime` is not used in the code and can be removed.

6. Optimize the loop: The loop that iterates over the string can be simplified by directly accessing the characters using an index, instead of using the range-based for loop.

7. Reduce the number of map lookups: The code currently performs multiple map lookups for `cnt[pre - i]`. We can optimize this by storing the value in a variable instead of performing repeated lookups.

Here is the optimized version of the code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <map>
using namespace std;

void solve() {
    int n;
    cin >> n;
    string s;
    cin >> s;
    vector<int> cnt(2); // Use vector instead of map to store frequencies
    cnt[1]++;
    int pre = 0;
    int ans = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        int d = s[i] - '0';
        pre += d;
        ans += cnt[pre - i];
        cnt[pre - i]++;
    }
    cout << ans << endl;
}

int main() {
    int t;
    cin >> t;
    while (t--) {
        solve();
    }
    return 0;
}
```

This optimized code reduces unnecessary includes, removes macros, and changes the map to a vector for efficient counting. It also simplifies the loop and reduces the number of map lookups.
