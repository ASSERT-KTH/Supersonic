The provided code appears to be a program that performs polynomial multiplication using the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm. The program first generates a list of prime numbers using the Sieve of Eratosthenes. Then, it reads inputs for the number of polynomials to multiply, the range of values for the coefficients, and the query values. Finally, it performs the polynomial multiplication and outputs the results.

Upon analyzing the code, the following potential areas for optimization can be identified:

1. Unnecessary includes: The code includes the entire `bits/stdc++.h` header, which is not recommended as it may slow down compilation time. Instead, it is better to include only the necessary headers.

2. Inefficient data structures: The code uses a vector `pr` to store prime numbers and a vector `g` to store divisors. However, these vectors are not efficiently used. For example, `g` is not cleared after each query, resulting in unnecessary memory usage.

3. Redundant computations: The code performs unnecessary computations for each query value, such as calculating the divisors repeatedly. This can be optimized by calculating the divisors once and storing them for future queries.

4. Inefficient looping: The code uses a range-based for loop (`fore`) for iterating over vectors. However, it would be more efficient to use a regular for loop with an integer index.

5. Lack of compiler optimizations: The code does not include any compiler optimizations or pragma directives that can hint the compiler to optimize certain parts of the code. Adding appropriate pragmas can improve the efficiency of the program.

Based on these observations, the following optimization strategy can be proposed:

1. Replace the `bits/stdc++.h` header with the necessary headers (`iostream`, `vector`, `cmath`, etc.) to reduce compilation time.

2. Use a more efficient data structure for storing prime numbers. Instead of using a vector, consider using a bitset or a bool array to mark the prime numbers.

3. Optimize the calculation of divisors. Calculate the divisors once and store them for future queries. This can be done by modifying the `SieveOfEratosthenes` function to generate a vector of divisors for each number.

4. Replace the range-based for loop (`fore`) with a regular for loop for iterating over vectors.

5. Add compiler optimizations or pragma directives to guide the compiler in optimizing the code. For example, use the `-O2` optimization flag or add `#pragma` directives for loop unrolling or function inlining.

Let's now proceed with the step-by-step explanation of each optimization and provide the optimized code.
