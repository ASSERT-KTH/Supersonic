The given code seems to solve a problem that involves finding the maximum sum of products of three numbers, where each number is chosen from a different array. The code uses a recursive approach with memoization to solve the problem.

Upon analyzing the code, the following potential optimizations and improvements can be suggested:

1. Avoid unnecessary includes: The code includes `<bits/stdc++.h>`, which is a non-standard header and includes a large number of standard headers. It is recommended to include only the necessary standard headers, such as `<iostream>` and `<vector>`, to reduce compilation time and avoid potential conflicts.

2. Remove unnecessary macros: The macro `_` is defined to enable faster input/output operations. However, it is not used in the code, so it can be safely removed.

3. Use `constexpr` instead of `const` for constant variables: The variables `inf` and `mod` are defined as constants using `const`, but they can be declared as `constexpr` instead, which allows the compiler to evaluate them at compile-time.

4. Replace `vector` with array: The code uses `vector` to store the input arrays `v[0]`, `v[1]`, and `v[2]`. Since the sizes of the arrays are known at compile-time, it is more efficient to use arrays instead of `vector`. This can help reduce memory overhead and improve cache locality.

5. Optimize the recursive function: The `solve` function is called recursively with three indices (`idx0`, `idx1`, `idx2`) to track the current positions in the arrays. However, the function can be modified to use a single index and calculate the corresponding indices for each array using simple arithmetic. This can potentially reduce the number of function calls and improve performance.

6. Use a multi-dimensional array instead of a 3D array: The current implementation uses a 3D array `dp` to store the computed results for different combinations of indices. However, since the maximum value of each index is `N`, where `N = 210`, it is more memory-efficient to use a multi-dimensional array of size `N x N x N` instead of `dp[N][N][N]`.

7. Avoid unnecessary function calls: The `solve` function makes multiple recursive calls with the same parameters in different orders. This results in redundant computations. By reordering the recursive calls, we can avoid these redundant function calls and potentially reduce the number of function calls.

8. Utilize loop unrolling: The three innermost loops in the `solve` function can be unrolled, which means manually duplicating the loop body to reduce loop overhead and improve instruction-level parallelism.

Based on these optimizations, the optimized code can be written as follows:
