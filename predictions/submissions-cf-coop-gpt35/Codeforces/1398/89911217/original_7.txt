The provided code solves a problem that involves finding the maximum possible sum of products of three numbers, one from each of the three input arrays. The code uses a recursive approach with memoization to avoid redundant computations.

Let's analyze the code to identify potential areas for optimization:

1. Input and Output:
   - The code uses `cin` and `cout` for input and output operations, respectively. These operations are known to be slower compared to other input/output methods, such as `scanf` and `printf`. We can switch to these faster I/O methods to improve performance.
   - The code uses `endl` to print a newline character. However, `endl` flushes the output stream, which can be an expensive operation. We can replace `endl` with `'\n'` to avoid unnecessary flushing.

2. Memory Usage:
   - The code uses a 3D array `dp` of size `N x N x N` to store the computed values of the recursive function. However, the problem statement specifies that the maximum size of the input arrays is `210`. Therefore, we can reduce the size of the `dp` array to `210 x 210 x 210` to save memory.
   - The code initializes the `dp` array using `memset` with -1. However, the array elements are of type `int`, so it would be more appropriate to initialize them with a large negative value, such as `-inf`, instead of -1.

3. Loop Optimization:
   - The recursive function `solve` is called multiple times with the same arguments. We can optimize this by storing the computed values of `solve` in a temporary variable and reusing them instead of making redundant function calls.

Based on the above analysis, here is the proposed optimization strategy:

1. Replace `cin` and `cout` with `scanf` and `printf` for faster input/output.
2. Replace `endl` with `'\n'` to avoid unnecessary flushing.
3. Reduce the size of the `dp` array to `210 x 210 x 210`.
4. Initialize the `dp` array with a large negative value, such as `-inf`.
5. Store the computed values of `solve` in a temporary variable and reuse them instead of making redundant function calls.

Now, let's apply these optimization steps to the code:
