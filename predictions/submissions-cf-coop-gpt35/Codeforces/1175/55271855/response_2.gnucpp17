Code Analysis:
1. The code includes unnecessary header files `<bits/stdc++.h>`, `<vector>`, `<algorithm>`, and `<iostream>`. Only the necessary header files should be included to reduce compilation time and memory usage.
2. The code includes several unnecessary typedefs and macros that are not used in the program. These can be removed to simplify the code.
3. The code uses `transform()` function from the `<algorithm>` header to convert strings to lowercase and uppercase. However, this operation is not required in the given code and can be removed.
4. The code uses the `__gcd()` function from the `<numeric>` header to calculate the greatest common divisor. However, this function is not necessary in this code as the `lcm()` function is not used.
5. The code uses the `forn()` macro for looping, which is unnecessary and can be replaced with a simple `for` loop.
6. The code uses `scanf()` and `printf()` functions for input/output, which can be replaced with `cin` and `cout` respectively for simplicity.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Remove unnecessary header files and typedefs to reduce compilation time and memory usage.
2. Remove unnecessary macros and function calls to simplify the code.
3. Replace `scanf()` and `printf()` with `cin` and `cout` respectively for simplicity.
4. Optimize the loops to reduce unnecessary computations.
5. Avoid unnecessary assignments and use more efficient algorithms where applicable.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Remove unnecessary header files and typedefs:
   - Remove the following unnecessary header files: `<bits/stdc++.h>`, `<vector>`, and `<algorithm>`.
   - Remove the `typedef` statements for `ll`, `vi`, and `vl`, as they are not used in the code.
   - Remove the `#define` macros `all`, `open_file`, `write_file`, `mem`, `show`, `forn`, `lower`, and `upper`, as they are not used in the code.

2. Replace `scanf()` and `printf()` with `cin` and `cout`:
   - Replace `scanf("%d %d", &l, &r)` with `cin >> l >> r`.
   - Replace `cout << nb << endl` with `cout << nb << "\n"`.

3. Optimize the loops:
   - Replace the `forn(i, MAX)` loop with a simple `for` loop: `for (i = 0; i < MAX; i++)`.
   - Remove the redundant `for` loop `for (int i = 1; i < (1 << 19); i++)`, as it performs unnecessary assignments and calculations.
   - Optimize the nested `for` loops by using loop unrolling and swapping the loop order to improve cache efficiency.

4. Avoid unnecessary assignments and use more efficient algorithms:
   - Remove the redundant assignment `A[x] = max(A[x], y)` inside the `forn(i, n)` loop.
   - Replace the `max(A[i], A[i - 1])` assignment inside the `for` loop with a simple assignment `A[i]`.
   - Optimize the calculation of `nb` inside the `while` loop by using a binary search algorithm instead of the nested `for` loop.
