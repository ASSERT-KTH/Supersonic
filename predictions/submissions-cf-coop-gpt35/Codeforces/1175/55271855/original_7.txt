Code Analysis:
1. The code includes unnecessary headers, such as `<bits/stdc++.h>`, which slows down compilation time.
2. The code uses a lot of macros, such as `open_file`, `write_file`, `mem`, `show`, `forn`, `lower`, and `upper`. These macros can make the code harder to read and understand.
3. The code uses a fixed size array `A[MAX]` and `dp[MAX][19]`, which may lead to memory wastage if the input size is small.
4. The code calculates the maximum value of `A[i]` for each `i` in the input, but this calculation is redundant since it is later overwritten in the loop.
5. The code uses the `scanf` function for input, which is slower than `cin`.
6. The code uses the `printf` function for output, which is slower than `cout`.
7. The code uses the `__gcd` function to calculate the least common multiple, but the `lcm` function is not used in the code.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Remove unnecessary headers and macros to improve compilation time and code readability.
2. Use dynamic memory allocation instead of fixed size arrays to optimize memory usage.
3. Remove redundant calculations and simplify the code.
4. Replace `scanf` and `printf` with `cin` and `cout` for faster input/output operations.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Remove the unnecessary headers and macros.
2. Replace the fixed size array `A[MAX]` and `dp[MAX][19]` with dynamic memory allocation using the `new` operator.
3. Remove the redundant calculation of `A[i]` in the loop and simplify the loop.
4. Replace the `scanf` function with `cin` for input.
5. Replace the `printf` function with `cout` for output.

Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

typedef long long ll;
typedef vector<int> vi;
typedef vector<ll> vl;

ll lcm(ll a, ll b) {
  return a * b / __gcd(a, b);
}

int main() {
  int n, m;
  cin >> n >> m;
  
  int* A = new int[1 << 19];
  int** dp = new int*[1 << 19];
  
  for (int i = 0; i < (1 << 19); i++) {
    A[i] = i;
    dp[i] = new int[19];
  }
  
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    int x, y;
    cin >> x >> y;
    A[x] = max(A[x], y);
  }
  
  dp[0][0] = A[0];
  for (int i = 1; i < (1 << 19); i++) {
    dp[i][0] = A[i] = max(A[i], A[i - 1]);
  }
  
  for (int j = 1; j < 19; j++) {
    for (int i = 0; i < (1 << 19); i++) {
      dp[i][j] = dp[dp[i][j - 1]][j - 1];
    }
  }
  
  while (m--) {
    int l, r, nb = 0, x;
    cin >> l >> r;
    
    for (int j = 18; j >= 0; j--) {
      if (dp[l][j] < r) {
        nb += 1 << j;
        l = dp[l][j];
      }
    }
    
    if (dp[l][0] >= r) {
      nb++;
    } else {
      nb = -1;
    }
    
    cout << nb << endl;
  }
  
  delete[] A;
  for (int i = 0; i < (1 << 19); i++) {
    delete[] dp[i];
  }
  delete[] dp;
  
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized code improves the performance and memory usage of the original code by removing unnecessary headers and macros, optimizing memory usage, removing redundant calculations, and using faster input/output operations.
