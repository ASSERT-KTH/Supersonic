Code Analysis:
- The code uses several typedefs and macros to define common data types and shortcuts for common functions.
- The code reads two integers `n` and `m` from the input.
- It initializes an array `A` of size `MAX` with values from 0 to `MAX-1`.
- It then reads `n` pairs of integers `x` and `y` from the input. For each pair, it updates the value of `A[x]` to be the maximum of its current value and `y`.
- It initializes the first column of the 2D array `dp` with the values of `A`.
- It then fills the remaining columns of `dp` using a dynamic programming approach.
- It then enters a loop that reads `m` pairs of integers `l` and `r` from the input. For each pair, it calculates `nb` based on the values in `dp` and prints it.

Potential optimizations:
1. Remove unnecessary includes: The code includes the entire `bits/stdc++.h` header which is not recommended as it includes a large number of unnecessary headers. It would be better to include only the required headers.
2. Remove unused typedefs and macros: The typedefs `vi` and `vl` are not used in the code. Similarly, the macros `mem`, `show`, `lower`, and `upper` are also not used. These can be removed to simplify the code.
3. Avoid using `using namespace std;`: It is generally considered a good practice to avoid using `using namespace std;` as it can lead to conflicts and make the code less readable. Instead, use the `std::` prefix when necessary.
4. Reduce the size of the `MAX` array: The code initializes an array `A` of size `MAX`. However, the values in `A` are only updated for indices from 0 to `n`. Therefore, it would be more efficient to initialize `A` with size `n` instead of `MAX`.
5. Use a more efficient data structure: The array `dp` is currently implemented as a 2D array. However, since it is a sparse matrix with only a few non-zero values, it would be more memory-efficient to use a sparse data structure such as a map or a set to store the non-zero values.
6. Optimize the calculation of `nb`: The current implementation of calculating `nb` uses a loop to iterate over the columns of `dp`. This can be optimized by using binary search or other techniques to find the appropriate column instead of iterating sequentially.
7. Replace `scanf` and `printf` with `cin` and `cout`: The code currently uses `scanf` and `printf` for input and output. However, `cin` and `cout` are generally faster and safer alternatives, especially when dealing with C++ input/output streams.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Remove unnecessary includes: Remove the `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` line and include only the necessary headers.
2. Remove unused typedefs and macros: Remove the typedefs `vi` and `vl`, and the macros `mem`, `show`, `lower`, and `upper`.
3. Avoid using `using namespace std;`: Replace `using namespace std;` with the `std::` prefix where necessary.
4. Reduce the size of the `MAX` array: Change the size of the array `A` from `MAX` to `n`.
5. Use a more efficient data structure: Replace the 2D array `dp` with a sparse data structure such as a map or a set to store the non-zero values.
6. Optimize the calculation of `nb`: Replace the loop for calculating `nb` with a more efficient technique such as binary search.
7. Replace `scanf` and `printf` with `cin` and `cout`: Replace the use of `scanf` and `printf` with `cin` and `cout` respectively.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Remove unnecessary includes:
   - Remove the line `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`.
   - Include only the necessary headers, such as `<iostream>`, `<vector>`, `<algorithm>`, and `<cmath>`.

2. Remove unused typedefs and macros:
   - Remove the typedefs `vi` and `vl`.
   - Remove the macros `mem`, `show`, `lower`, and `upper`.

3. Avoid using `using namespace std;`:
   - Replace `using namespace std;` with the `std::` prefix where necessary.
   - For example, replace `cin` with `std::cin`, `cout` with `std::cout`, and `endl` with `std::endl`.

4. Reduce the size of the `MAX` array:
   - Change the line `int const MAX = (1 << 19);` to `int const MAX = n;`.

5. Use a more efficient data structure:
   - Replace the line `int dp[MAX][19];` with `std::map<int, std::map<int, int>> dp;`.
   - Replace `dp[i][j]` with `dp[i][j]`.

6. Optimize the calculation of `nb`:
   - Replace the loop for calculating `nb` with the following code:
     ```
     auto it = dp.lower_bound(l);
     if (it != dp.end() && it->first < r) {
       nb += 1 << it->second;
       l = it->second;
       it = dp.lower_bound(l);
     }
     ```
7. Replace `scanf` and `printf` with `cin` and `cout`:
   - Replace `scanf("%d %d", &l, &r);` with `std::cin >> l >> r;`.
   - Replace `cout << nb << endl;` with `std::cout << nb << std::endl;`.

Optimized Code:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <map>
#include <cmath>

int main() {
  int n, m;
  std::cin >> n >> m;

  int const MAX = n;
  std::vector<int> A(MAX);
  for (int i = 0; i < MAX; i++) {
    A[i] = i;
  }

  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    int x, y;
    std::cin >> x >> y;
    A[x] = std::max(A[x], y);
  }

  std::map<int, std::map<int, int>> dp;
  dp[0][0] = A[0];
  for (int i = 1; i < MAX; i++) {
    dp[i][0] = A[i] = std::max(A[i], A[i - 1]);
  }

  for (int j = 1; j < 19; j++) {
    for (int i = 0; i < MAX; i++) {
      dp[i][j] = dp[dp[i][j - 1]][j - 1];
    }
  }

  while (m--) {
    int l, r, nb = 0;
    std::cin >> l >> r;

    auto it = dp.lower_bound(l);
    if (it != dp.end() && it->first < r) {
      nb += 1 << it->second;
      l = it->second;
      it = dp.lower_bound(l);
    }

    if (it != dp.end() && it->first >= r) {
      nb++;
    } else {
      nb = -1;
    }

    std::cout << nb << std::endl;
  }

  return 0;
}
```

Note: The optimized code might have minor differences in the output formatting due to the use of different input/output methods (`cin` and `cout` instead of `scanf` and `printf`).
