The provided code is a C++ program that solves a maze problem. The program takes input for the number of test cases, the dimensions of the maze, and the maze itself. The program then checks if it is possible to reach a goal ('G') from the starting position ('B') in the maze. The program uses a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm to explore the maze.

Upon analyzing the code, the following potential performance bottlenecks and areas for optimization can be identified:

1. Inefficient Data Structures:
   - The `maze` array is a 2D character array that represents the maze. However, the array is unnecessarily large, as it is declared with a fixed size of 51x51. This wastes memory, especially if the actual maze is smaller.
   - The `visited` array is also a 2D boolean array that keeps track of visited cells in the maze. Similar to the `maze` array, it is unnecessarily large and can be optimized.

2. Redundant Computations:
   - The `block` function unnecessarily checks and updates the neighboring cells of the current cell. This can be optimized by only checking and updating the neighboring cells if necessary.

3. Loop Optimization:
   - The nested loops in the `main` function iterate over the entire maze, even though the code only needs to iterate until the dimensions of the maze. This can be optimized by changing the loop conditions to `i < n` and `j < m` instead of `i <= n` and `j <= m`.

4. Compiler Optimizations:
   - The code does not make use of any compiler optimizations or pragma directives. By enabling compiler optimizations, we can allow the compiler to apply various optimization techniques to improve the performance of the code.

Based on the analysis, the following step-by-step optimization strategy can be formulated:

1. Replace the fixed-size 2D arrays `maze` and `visited` with dynamically allocated arrays that have sizes based on the dimensions of the maze.
2. Modify the `block` function to only check and update neighboring cells if necessary, instead of checking all four neighbors unconditionally.
3. Change the loop conditions in the `main` function to `i < n` and `j < m`.
4. Enable compiler optimizations to allow the compiler to optimize the code further.
