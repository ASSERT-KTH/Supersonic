Code Analysis:
1. The code uses a 2D character array `maze` to represent a maze, where each cell can be either ".", "#", "B", or "G".
2. The code uses a 2D boolean array `visited` to keep track of visited cells in the maze.
3. The `block` function checks if a given cell is blocked by a wall or a goal. If the cell is ".", it is replaced with "#".
4. The `dfs` function performs a depth-first search to explore the maze, marking visited cells and decreasing the count of "G" cells.
5. The main function takes input for the number of test cases, the dimensions of the maze, and the maze itself. It then checks if the maze is solvable by calling the `block` function and performs the depth-first search using the `dfs` function.

Potential optimizations:
1. The use of a character array and a boolean array for the maze and visited cells can be memory inefficient, especially for large mazes. A more memory-efficient alternative would be to use a bitset to represent the maze and visited cells.
2. The `block` function currently takes individual cell coordinates as input and checks the neighboring cells. This can be optimized by passing the maze and the current coordinates to the function, allowing direct access to the neighboring cells without the need for additional checks.
3. The `dfs` function currently uses recursive calls to explore the neighbors of a cell. This can be optimized by using an iterative approach, such as a stack or a queue, to perform the depth-first search.
4. The use of `memset` to reset the visited array for each test case can be optimized by initializing the array at the declaration itself.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Replace the `maze` and `visited` arrays with a bitset to improve memory efficiency.
2. Modify the `block` function to take the maze and the current coordinates as input and directly modify the neighboring cells.
3. Rewrite the `dfs` function to use an iterative approach, such as a stack or a queue, to perform the depth-first search.
4. Initialize the `visited` array at the declaration itself instead of using `memset` after each test case.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Replace the `maze` and `visited` arrays with a bitset to improve memory efficiency:
   - Instead of using a 2D character array `maze` and a 2D boolean array `visited`, we can use a single bitset to represent both the maze and the visited cells.
   - This will reduce the memory usage, as each cell will only require a single bit instead of a character or a boolean value.
   - To achieve this, we can use a 1D bitset of size `n * m`, where each bit represents a cell in the maze.
   - We will need to define a few helper functions to get and set the bits in the bitset based on the coordinates of the cell.

2. Modify the `block` function to take the maze and the current coordinates as input and directly modify the neighboring cells:
   - Instead of passing individual cell coordinates to the `block` function, we can modify it to take the maze and the current coordinates as input.
   - This will allow us to directly access the neighboring cells without the need for additional checks.
   - We can use the helper functions defined in the previous step to get and set the bits in the bitset.

3. Rewrite the `dfs` function to use an iterative approach:
   - The current recursive implementation of the `dfs` function can lead to stack overflow for large mazes.
   - We can rewrite the function to use an iterative approach, such as a stack or a queue, to perform the depth-first search.
   - This will eliminate the need for recursive calls and make the function more memory efficient.
   - We can use a stack or a queue to keep track of the cells to be visited, and a separate bitset to mark the visited cells.

4. Initialize the `visited` array at the declaration itself instead of using `memset` after each test case:
   - Instead of using `memset` to reset the `visited` array after each test case, we can initialize the array at the declaration itself.
   - This will eliminate the need for an additional function call and improve the code readability.
