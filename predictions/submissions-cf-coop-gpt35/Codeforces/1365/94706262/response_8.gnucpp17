The given code is for a program that solves a maze problem. The program takes the dimensions of the maze and the maze itself as input. It then checks if it is possible to reach the goal ('G') from the starting point ('B') by traversing through the maze. The program uses a depth-first search algorithm to explore the maze.

Upon analyzing the code, the following potential areas for optimization can be identified:

1. Redundant checks in the `block` function: The `block` function checks the neighboring cells of a given cell and performs certain actions based on the contents of those cells. However, the function is performing redundant checks by checking if the cell is out of bounds before checking its contents. This can be optimized by removing the out-of-bounds checks and directly checking the contents of the neighboring cells.

2. Inefficient memory usage: The `maze` and `visited` arrays are declared with a fixed size of 51x51, which wastes memory if the actual maze dimensions are smaller. The size of these arrays should be dynamically allocated based on the input maze dimensions.

3. Inefficient loop conditions: The loop conditions in the main `for` loops that iterate over the maze are checking the loop variables against `n` and `m`. These conditions can be optimized by using the `<=` operator instead of `<` operator, as the loop variables start from 1.

4. Inefficient depth-first search: The depth-first search algorithm is implemented recursively, which can lead to a large number of function calls and stack usage. This can be optimized by implementing an iterative version of the depth-first search algorithm using a stack data structure.

5. Unnecessary `memset` call: The `memset` call is used to initialize the `visited` array with zeros. However, this is unnecessary as the array is already initialized with zeros during declaration.

Based on these observations, the following optimization strategy can be formulated:

1. Replace the out-of-bounds checks in the `block` function with direct checks for the neighboring cells.

2. Dynamically allocate the `maze` and `visited` arrays based on the input maze dimensions.

3. Optimize the loop conditions in the main `for` loops to use the `<=` operator instead of `<` operator.

4. Implement an iterative version of the depth-first search algorithm using a stack data structure.

5. Remove the unnecessary `memset` call.
