The given code is a C++ program that solves a maze problem. The program takes multiple test cases as input and for each test case, it reads the maze dimensions, the maze itself, and then checks if it is possible to reach the goal from the starting position.

Here are some potential performance bottlenecks and areas for optimization in the given code:

1. Inefficient memory usage: The `maze` and `visited` arrays are declared with fixed sizes of 51x51 but the actual maze dimensions are read from input. This can lead to wasted memory if the actual maze size is smaller. Additionally, the `memset` function is used to reset the `visited` array, which can be a slow operation for large arrays.

2. Redundant checks and assignments: The `block` function checks for conditions that have already been checked in the main loop. For example, the condition `(r - 1 == n && c == m && G > 0)` is checked twice - once in the main loop and again in the `block` function. Similarly, the `dfs` function checks for boundary conditions that have already been checked in the `block` function.

3. Inefficient search: The `dfs` function performs a depth-first search to find the goal position. However, it does not take advantage of the fact that the maze is a grid and can be represented as a graph. This can lead to redundant computations and unnecessary function calls.

4. Lack of compiler optimizations: The code does not include any compiler optimizations or pragma directives that can hint the compiler to optimize certain parts of the code.

Based on these observations, here is an optimization strategy:

1. Replace fixed-size arrays with dynamically allocated memory: Instead of using fixed-size arrays for `maze` and `visited`, allocate memory dynamically based on the actual maze dimensions read from input. This will reduce memory wastage.

2. Eliminate redundant checks and assignments: Remove the redundant conditions in the `block` function and the `dfs` function, as they have already been checked in the main loop. This will reduce unnecessary computations.

3. Optimize the search algorithm: Instead of performing a depth-first search, modify the algorithm to perform a breadth-first search (BFS) using a queue. This will take advantage of the grid structure of the maze and reduce redundant function calls.

4. Use compiler optimizations: Add compiler optimizations or pragma directives to hint the compiler to optimize certain parts of the code, such as loop unrolling or function inlining.
