The code provided is a C++ program that solves a maze problem. The program takes input for the number of test cases, the dimensions of the maze, and the maze itself. It then checks if it is possible to reach the goal from the start position while avoiding blocked cells. The program uses a depth-first search algorithm to explore the maze.

Upon analyzing the code, several potential optimization opportunities can be identified:

1. Inefficient Data Structures: The program uses a 2D array to represent the maze and a 2D array to store visited cells. Both arrays have fixed dimensions of 51x51, which is much larger than necessary for most test cases. This leads to unnecessary memory usage and potentially slower performance.

2. Redundant Computations: The `block` function checks the cells above, below, left, and right of the current cell to determine if they are blocked. However, this function is called for every cell in the maze, resulting in redundant computations. Additionally, the function modifies the maze by replacing empty cells with blocked cells, which is unnecessary for the main algorithm.

3. Inefficient Looping: The loops that iterate over the cells in the maze start from index 1 and go up to the dimensions of the maze. This means that the first row and column of the maze are never used. The loops should start from index 0 to avoid unnecessary iterations.

4. Inefficient Memory Clearing: The `memset` function is used to clear the `visited` array, but it clears the entire array, even though only a portion of it is used. This leads to unnecessary memory writes.

Based on these observations, the following optimization strategy can be formulated:

1. Use dynamically allocated arrays for the maze and visited cells, with dimensions based on the actual size of the maze. This will reduce memory usage.

2. Modify the `block` function to take the maze as an argument and return a boolean value indicating whether the current cell is blocked. This will eliminate the need to modify the maze in the function and avoid redundant computations.

3. Modify the loops that iterate over the cells in the maze to start from index 0 instead of 1. This will eliminate the unused first row and column.

4. Instead of using `memset` to clear the visited array, iterate over the cells in the maze and set the corresponding visited cells to false. This will avoid unnecessary memory writes.

5. Consider enabling compiler optimizations, such as loop unrolling and function inlining, to further improve performance.

Now, let's proceed with the step-by-step explanation and provide the optimized code.
