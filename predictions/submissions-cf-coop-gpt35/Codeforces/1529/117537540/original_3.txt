Upon analyzing the given code, I have identified several potential areas for optimization:

1. Redundant includes: The code includes the entire `<bits/stdc++.h>` header, which is not recommended as it includes many unnecessary libraries. Instead, we can include specific headers that are required for the code.

2. Unnecessary macros: The code defines macros for `pii`, `endl`, and `long`, which are not used in the code. We can remove these macros to simplify the code.

3. Inefficient data structures: The code uses `vector` and `array` for storing matrices and arrays. However, since the size of the matrix is fixed at 600x600, we can use regular arrays instead of `vector` and `array` to improve memory access speed.

4. Inefficient algorithm: The code uses a modified version of Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path from each node to every other node. However, the algorithm implementation can be further optimized to reduce redundant computations and improve performance.

5. Magic numbers: The code uses the number 1e18 as a placeholder for infinity. It is better to use a named constant or macro to represent infinity for better code readability.

Based on these observations, here is the step-by-step optimization strategy:

1. Remove unnecessary includes and macros to simplify the code.

2. Replace `vector` and `array` with regular arrays to improve memory access speed.

3. Optimize the Dijkstra's algorithm implementation to reduce redundant computations and improve performance.

4. Replace the magic number with a named constant or macro to represent infinity.

Now, let's proceed with the optimization steps and provide the optimized code.
