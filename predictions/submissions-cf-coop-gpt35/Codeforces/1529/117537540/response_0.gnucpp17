The given code is an implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path from every vertex to every other vertex in a graph. However, there are several areas in the code that can be optimized for better performance and memory usage. 

1. Data Structure Efficiency:
   - The current implementation uses a 2D array `matrix` to represent the graph. However, since the size of the array is fixed at 600x600, there is a significant waste of memory when the actual graph is smaller. We can optimize this by using a dynamic data structure like `vector<vector<int>>` instead, which will allocate memory based on the actual size of the graph.
   - The `cost` and `marked` vectors are initialized with the size `N`, but only `N - 1` elements are used. This can be optimized by initializing `cost` and `marked` vectors with a size of `N - 1`.

2. Unnecessary Computation:
   - The current implementation uses a nested loop to initialize the `matrix` array with a large value `1 << 30`. However, this is unnecessary as the array will be filled with actual values later in the code. We can remove this initialization step to save computation time.

3. Loop Optimization:
   - The loop `for (int j = 0; j < N; j++)` is used twice in the code. We can optimize this by combining the two loops into a single loop to reduce the number of iterations.

4. Compiler Optimization:
   - We can use compiler optimizations to further improve the performance of the code. For example, we can use optimization flags like `-O2` to enable compiler-level optimizations.
