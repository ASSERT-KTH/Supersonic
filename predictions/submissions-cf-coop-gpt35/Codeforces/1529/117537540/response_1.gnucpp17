Upon analyzing the given code, I have identified several potential areas for optimization:

1. Use `int` instead of `long` for `pii` and `long long` for `MOD`: The `pii` type is used to represent pairs of `long` integers, but since the matrix size is limited to 600, it is safe to use `int` instead. Similarly, the `MOD` value is used as an integer, so it can be declared as `int` instead of `long long`.

2. Remove unnecessary includes: The code includes the entire `<bits/stdc++.h>` header, which is not necessary and can slow down the compilation process. We can remove this and include only the required headers, such as `<iostream>` and `<vector>`.

3. Avoid using `using namespace std;`: This statement imports all names from the `std` namespace into the global namespace, which can lead to naming conflicts. It is better to explicitly qualify the names with the `std::` prefix when using them.

4. Use `constexpr` instead of `#define` for constants: Instead of using `#define` to define the `endl` and `MOD` constants, it is better to use `constexpr` to define them as compile-time constants. This allows the compiler to optimize their usage.

5. Optimize the matrix initialization: The matrix is initialized with a large value `1 << 30`, which represents infinity. However, since the matrix size is limited to 600, we can initialize it with a smaller value that still represents infinity, such as `INT_MAX`. This can save memory and improve cache performance.

6. Optimize the Dijkstra's algorithm: The current implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm has some inefficiencies. The inner loop that updates the costs can be simplified and optimized. Additionally, the `marked` vector can be replaced with a simple boolean array, as only a boolean value is needed to check whether a vertex is marked or not.

7. Remove unnecessary modulo operations: The modulo operations in the loops can be avoided by using the `%` operator only once before the loop, and then using a separate variable to keep track of the next index. This eliminates the need for multiple modulo operations inside the loop.
