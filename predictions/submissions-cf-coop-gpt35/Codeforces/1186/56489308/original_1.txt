After analyzing the given code, I have identified the following potential optimizations:

1. Avoiding unnecessary imports: The code includes the `bits/stdc++.h` header, which is not recommended as it imports a large number of libraries. We can remove this import and include only the necessary headers.

2. Improving input/output efficiency: The code uses `cin` and `cout` for input and output operations. These operations are slower compared to other methods like `scanf` and `printf`. We can use `scanf` and `printf` instead to improve the input/output efficiency.

3. Avoiding unnecessary type conversions: The variable `rem` is declared as `ll` (long long), but it is used as an argument for `llround`, which returns a `long long` value. We can directly assign the result of `llround` to `rem` without the need for type conversion.

4. Reducing the precision: The code sets the precision of the output stream to 20 decimal places using `cout.precision(20)`. This precision is not necessary for the given problem and can be reduced to a smaller value.

5. Avoiding repeated calculations: The code calculates `floor(a[i])` multiple times in the loop. We can store the result of this calculation in a variable and reuse it.

6. Optimizing the loop: The loop that calculates the sum of `floor(a[i])` can be optimized by using the prefix sum technique. Instead of summing the values one by one, we can calculate the prefix sum and access the sum of any subarray in constant time.

Based on these optimizations, here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <cmath>

int main() {
  std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  std::cin.tie(NULL);
  std::cout.precision(10); // Reduced precision to 10 decimal places
  
  int n;
  std::cin >> n;
  
  std::vector<double> a(n);
  double tol = 1.e-7;
  int ent = 0;
  double tot = 0.;
  
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    std::scanf("%lf", &a[i]); // Using scanf for input
    double floor_a = std::floor(a[i]); // Storing the result of floor(a[i]) in a variable
    
    if (std::abs(floor_a - a[i]) < tol) {
      ent++;
    }
    
    tot += floor_a;
  }
  
  long long rem = std::llround(tot); // Directly assigning the result of llround to rem
  
  std::cerr << "rem " << rem << std::endl;
  
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    if (rem < 0 && std::abs(std::floor(a[i]) - a[i]) > tol) {
      std::printf("%.0f\n", std::round(std::floor(a[i])) + 1); // Using printf for output
      rem++;
    } else {
      std::printf("%.0f\n", std::round(std::floor(a[i]))); // Using printf for output
    }
  }
  
  return 0;
}
```

These optimizations improve the efficiency of the code by reducing unnecessary calculations and using more efficient input/output operations. The changes are minimal and preserve the functionality and output of the original code.
