Code Analysis:
- The code uses several preprocessor macros and includes a large number of headers, which can slow down compilation and increase memory usage.
- The `get` function calculates the prime factors of a given number. It can be optimized to reduce unnecessary calculations.
- The `max2` struct is used to keep track of the two largest values. However, it is not used efficiently and can be simplified.
- The `dfs` function performs a depth-first search on the graph. It uses recursion, which can be expensive in terms of memory and performance.
- The `main` function reads input, initializes data structures, calls the `dfs` function, and prints the result. 

Optimization Strategy:
1. Remove unnecessary preprocessor macros and headers.
2. Optimize the `get` function to avoid redundant calculations.
3. Simplify the `max2` struct to reduce memory usage.
4. Replace the recursive implementation of `dfs` with an iterative approach.
5. Use a custom stack to replace the implicit system stack used in recursion.
6. Use the `reserve` function to preallocate memory for vectors.
7. Use `emplace_back` instead of `push_back` to optimize memory allocation.
8. Use a `vector` instead of a `map` for the `dp` array.
9. Use a `vector` instead of a `map` for the `d` array.
10. Use a `vector` instead of a `map` for the `primes` array.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Remove unnecessary preprocessor macros and headers.
   - The `pragma` directive can be removed as it is not necessary for optimization.
   - The `bits/stdc++.h` header includes a large number of headers, which can increase compilation time and memory usage. Instead, include only the necessary headers.
   
2. Optimize the `get` function to avoid redundant calculations.
   - The `ret` vector can be reserved memory in advance using `reserve` function.
   - Instead of checking for divisibility by all numbers up to the square root of `x`, we can check only prime numbers up to the square root of `x` using the `d` array.
   
3. Simplify the `max2` struct to reduce memory usage.
   - Instead of using two separate variables `x` and `y`, we can use a single variable `mx` to store the maximum value. We can then calculate the second largest value on the fly when needed.

4. Replace the recursive implementation of `dfs` with an iterative approach.
   - Create a custom stack to store the nodes to be processed.
   - Instead of using recursion, use a loop to process the nodes until the stack is empty.
   - Use an additional stack to store the parent nodes to avoid revisiting them.
   
5. Use a custom stack to replace the implicit system stack used in recursion.
   - Create a `vector` to store the nodes to be processed instead of using the system stack.
   - Use the `emplace_back` function to optimize memory allocation.

6. Use the `reserve` function to preallocate memory for vectors.
   - Preallocate memory for the `g`, `val`, and `primes` vectors using the `reserve` function.

7. Use `emplace_back` instead of `push_back` to optimize memory allocation.
   - Replace `push_back` with `emplace_back` when adding elements to vectors to optimize memory allocation.

8. Use a `vector` instead of a `map` for the `dp` array.
   - Replace the `map` with a `vector` and use the node index as the index of the vector to store the value.

9. Use a `vector` instead of a `map` for the `d` array.
   - Replace the `map` with a `vector` and use the number itself as the index of the vector to store the value.

10. Use a `vector` instead of a `map` for the `primes` array.
    - Replace the `map` with a `vector` to store the prime numbers.

The optimized code has the same functionality and output as the original code, but it has been optimized for efficiency. The changes made have minimized memory usage and improved the running time of the program.
