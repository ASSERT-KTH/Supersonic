Code Analysis:

1. The code uses several macros to define commonly used operations and functions. While macros can provide convenience, they can also lead to code bloat and potential performance issues if used excessively.
2. The `get` function calculates the prime factors of a given number. It iterates from 2 to the square root of the number and checks if it is a factor. If it is, it adds it to the vector `ret` and divides the number by the factor until it is no longer divisible. This function can be optimized to reduce redundant computations.
3. The `max2` struct represents the two largest values encountered during the DFS traversal. It has a `rlx` function to update the values. However, the `sum` function is not used, and it is unclear why the sum of the two largest values is calculated.
4. The `dfs` function performs a depth-first search traversal on the graph. It recursively calls itself on each child node and updates the `dp` map with the maximum chain length for each prime factor encountered in the subtree. The `ans` variable keeps track of the maximum chain length encountered so far.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Remove unnecessary macros: The macros `fs`, `sc`, `all`, `rall`, `pb`, `MP`, `sz`, `fastio`, and `sqr` can be removed as they are not used in the code and may lead to code bloat.
2. Optimize the `get` function:
   - Eliminate redundant computations: The loop in the `get` function iterates from 2 to the square root of the number. However, it can be optimized to iterate only up to the largest prime factor of the number. This can be achieved by checking if `x` is divisible by `d[x]` instead of checking if it is divisible by `i`.
   - Use a set instead of a vector: Instead of using a vector to store the prime factors, a set can be used to eliminate duplicates automatically. This will reduce the complexity of finding unique prime factors.
3. Simplify the `max2` struct:
   - Remove the `sum` function: The `sum` function is not used in the code, so it can be removed.
   - Remove the default constructor: Since the default constructor is not used, it can be removed to simplify the code.
4. Optimize the `dfs` function:
   - Use references instead of copying vectors: Instead of passing vectors by value, pass them by reference to avoid unnecessary copying.
   - Use a range-based loop: Instead of using a traditional for loop, use a range-based loop when iterating over the elements of a vector.
   - Use unordered_map instead of map: The `dp` map is used to store the maximum chain length for each prime factor encountered in the subtree. Using an unordered_map instead of a map can improve the lookup time from O(log n) to O(1).
   - Optimize the loop inside `dfs`: The loop inside `dfs` can be optimized by using range-based loops and avoiding unnecessary computations.
   - Optimize the calculation of `ans`: Instead of using `t[i].sum() + 1` to calculate `ans`, directly calculate the maximum chain length for each prime factor and update `ans` accordingly.

Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. Remove unnecessary macros:
   - Remove the following macros as they are not used in the code: `fs`, `sc`, `all`, `rall`, `pb`, `MP`, `sz`, `fastio`, and `sqr`.
   - These macros do not contribute to the functionality or performance of the code and only add unnecessary complexity.

2. Optimize the `get` function:
   - Remove redundant computations:
     - Modify the loop in the `get` function to iterate from 2 to the largest prime factor of `x`.
     - Replace `i * i <= x` with `d[x] * d[x] <= x`.
   - Use a set instead of a vector:
     - Change the return type of the `get` function from `vector<int>` to `set<int>`.
     - Replace the `ret.pb(i)` statement with `ret.insert(i)`.
     - This will automatically eliminate duplicate prime factors from the set.

3. Simplify the `max2` struct:
   - Remove the `sum` function:
     - Remove the `sum` function from the `max2` struct as it is not used in the code.
   - Remove the default constructor:
     - Remove the default constructor from the `max2` struct as it is not used in the code.

4. Optimize the `dfs` function:
   - Use references instead of copying vectors:
     - Modify the `dfs` function signature to pass vectors by reference instead of by value.
   - Use a range-based loop:
     - Replace the traditional for loop in the `dfs` function with a range-based loop when iterating over the elements of a vector.
   - Use unordered_map instead of map:
     - Change the type of `dp` from `map<int, int>` to `unordered_map<int, int>`.
   - Optimize the loop inside `dfs`:
     - Replace the traditional for loop in the loop inside `dfs` with a range-based loop.
     - Eliminate unnecessary computations by checking if `dp[u][x]` exists before accessing it.
   - Optimize the calculation of `ans`:
     - Modify the calculation of `ans` to directly calculate the maximum chain length for each prime factor and update `ans` accordingly.

        dp[v][x] = t[i++].x + 1;

int main() {

    for (int i = 2; i < N; i++) {

            d[i] = i;
            primes.push_back(i);
        }
        for (auto x : primes) {
            if (x > d[i] || x * i >= N)
                break;
            d[x * i] = x;
        }
    }

    int n;
    cin >> n;

        g[b].push_back(a);
