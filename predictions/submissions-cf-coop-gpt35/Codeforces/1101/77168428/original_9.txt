Code Analysis:
1. The code defines several macros for convenience, such as `fs`, `sc`, `all`, `rall`, etc. These macros are used to simplify code and improve readability.
2. The code uses a vector of vectors `g` to represent the graph, where `g[i]` contains the neighbors of node `i`.
3. The code uses a map `dp` to store the maximum length of the path for each prime factor for each node.
4. The code uses a vector `val` to store the value of each node.
5. The code defines a function `get()` that returns a vector containing the prime factors of a given number.
6. The code defines a struct `max2` that stores the two maximum values.
7. The code uses a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm to calculate the maximum length of the path for each node.

Potential Optimizations:
1. Avoid using `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`. This header includes the entire standard library, which can slow down compilation and increase memory usage.
2. Remove unnecessary macros. While macros can improve code readability, they can also introduce overhead when expanded.
3. Replace vectors with arrays where possible. Vectors have additional overhead due to dynamic memory allocation and deallocation.
4. Avoid using `map` for `dp`. Maps have a higher memory overhead compared to arrays.
5. Optimize the `get()` function to avoid unnecessary iterations and improve prime factor calculation.
6. Replace the vector of `max2` with an array for better performance.
7. Consider using a bottom-up approach instead of a top-down approach in the DFS function to reduce recursion overhead.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Remove unnecessary macros `fs`, `sc`, `all`, `rall`, `pb`, `MP`, `sz`, `fastio`, and `sqr`.
2. Replace the vector `g` with an array `g` of size `N` to represent the graph. This will eliminate the overhead of dynamic memory allocation and deallocation.
3. Replace the map `dp` with a 2D array `dp` of size `N x M`, where `M` is the maximum number of prime factors of any node. This will reduce the memory overhead and improve cache locality.
4. Optimize the `get()` function to improve prime factor calculation. Instead of iterating up to the square root of `x`, iterate up to the square root of `val[v] + 1` in the `dfs()` function.
5. Replace the vector of `max2` with an array `t` of size `M` to store the maximum lengths.
6. Use a bottom-up approach in the `dfs()` function to calculate the maximum length of the path for each node. This will reduce recursion overhead.
7. Use compiler optimizations to improve performance. Add compiler pragmas to hint the compiler to optimize certain parts of the code.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Remove unnecessary macros: Remove the following macros: `fs`, `sc`, `all`, `rall`, `pb`, `MP`, `sz`, `fastio`, and `sqr`. These macros are not used and can be safely removed.

2. Replace the vector `g` with an array `g` of size `N`: Replace the line `vector<int> g[N]` with `int g[N][N]` to represent the graph. This will eliminate the overhead of dynamic memory allocation and deallocation associated with vectors.

3. Replace the map `dp` with a 2D array `dp` of size `N x M`: Replace the line `map<int, int> dp[N]` with `int dp[N][M]`, where `M` is the maximum number of prime factors of any node. This will reduce the memory overhead and improve cache locality.

4. Optimize the `get()` function: Modify the `get()` function as follows:
   - Replace the line `for (int i = 2; i * i <= x; i++)` with `for (int i = 2; i * i <= val[v] + 1; i++)`. This will limit the iteration up to the square root of `val[v] + 1`, instead of `x`, reducing unnecessary iterations.
   - Replace the line `ret.pb(i)` with `ret.push_back(i)`. This will avoid the overhead of dynamic memory allocation and deallocation associated with vectors.
   - Replace the line `ret.pb(x)` with `ret.push_back(x)`. This will avoid the overhead of dynamic memory allocation and deallocation associated with vectors.

5. Replace the vector of `max2` with an array `t` of size `M`: Replace the line `vector<max2> t(sz(cur))` with `max2 t[M]` to store the maximum lengths. This will eliminate the overhead of dynamic memory allocation and deallocation associated with vectors.

6. Use a bottom-up approach in the `dfs()` function: Modify the `dfs()` function as follows:
   - Replace the line `dfs(u, v)` with a loop over all neighbors of `v` to calculate the maximum lengths bottom-up.
   - Replace the line `for (int i = 0; i < sz(cur); i++)` with `for (int i = 0; i < M; i++)` to loop over all prime factors.
   - Replace the line `if (!dp[u].count(x)) continue; t[i].rlx(dp[u][x]);` with `t[i].rlx(dp[u][x]);` to access the maximum length directly from the `dp` array.
   - Replace the line `dp[v][x] = t[i].x + 1;` with `dp[v][x] = t[i].sum() + 1;` to store the sum of the maximum lengths in the `dp` array.

7. Use compiler optimizations: Add compiler pragmas to hint the compiler to optimize certain parts of the code. Add `#pragma GCC optimize("O3")` before the `main()` function to enable compiler optimizations.

      t[i].rlx(dp[u][x]);
    }
  }
  for (int i = 0; i < cur.size(); i++) {
    int x = cur[i];
    ans = max(ans, t[i].sum() + 1);
    dp[v][x] = t[i].sum() + 1;
  }
}

    for (int x = 2 * i; x < N; x += i) {

        primes[x] = i;
    }
  }
  int n;

  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    cin >> val[i];
  for (int i = 0, a, b; i < n - 1; i++) {

    a--;

    g[a][b] = 1;
    g[b][a] = 1;
  }
  dfs(0, -1);
  cout << ans << '\n';
  return 0;
