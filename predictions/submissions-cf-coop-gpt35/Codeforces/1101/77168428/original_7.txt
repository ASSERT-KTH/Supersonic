The provided code seems to be solving a graph problem, where the goal is to find the maximum sum of two distinct prime divisors of values assigned to nodes in a tree. 

Upon analyzing the code, the following potential optimizations can be identified:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The line `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` includes all standard library headers, which is excessive and can lead to slower compilation times. Instead, only include the necessary headers such as `<vector>`, `<map>`, `<iostream>`, etc.

2. Avoid using macros: The code uses macros for common operations like accessing the first and second elements of a pair, getting the size of a container, etc. This could lead to subtle bugs and make the code harder to read and understand. It is better to use explicit function calls or inline functions instead.

3. Pre-calculate prime divisors: The `get()` function calculates the prime divisors of a number `x` every time it is called. This can be time-consuming, especially if the same value is encountered multiple times. Instead, we can pre-calculate the prime divisors of all numbers in the range `2` to `N` (where `N` is a constant) using the `d` array.

4. Replace `map` with `vector` for `dp` array: The `dp` array is currently implemented as a map, which incurs an additional overhead due to the use of a binary search tree. Since the keys are integers, we can replace the map with a vector to improve performance.

5. Avoid unnecessary recursion: The `dfs` function uses recursion to traverse the tree. However, this can be avoided by using an iterative approach, which can potentially improve performance and reduce memory usage.

6. Optimize the loop in `dfs`: The loop in the `dfs` function can be optimized by using a range-based for loop instead of indexing. This can improve performance by avoiding unnecessary calculations.

7. Remove unused variables: The variable `sqr` is defined but never used in the code. It can be safely removed.

Based on these observations, let's proceed with the optimization steps.
