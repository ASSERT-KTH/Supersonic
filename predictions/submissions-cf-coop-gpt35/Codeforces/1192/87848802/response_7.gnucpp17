After analyzing the code, I have identified several potential optimizations that can improve its performance:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The code includes the entire "bits/stdc++.h" header, which is not recommended as it includes a large number of standard library headers. Instead, we can include only the necessary headers.

2. Avoid using macros: The code uses macros extensively, such as "x", "y", "pb", "eb", "all", "SZ", "FOR", "ROF", and "make_unique". Macros can lead to unexpected behavior and can be difficult to debug. We should replace these macros with regular functions or inline functions.

3. Optimize the use of the unordered_map: The code uses an unordered_map to store the strings encountered so far. However, we only need to check if a string is present or not. Instead of using an unordered_map, we can use a set to store the strings.

4. Avoid unnecessary string reversals: The code reverses each string and checks if the reversed string is present in the unordered_map. This is unnecessary and can be avoided. We can store the string as is in the set.

5. Optimize the use of the "dict" function: The "dict" function is used to convert a character to an integer index. Instead of using a function, we can use a lookup table or an array for faster conversion.

6. Optimize the "adding" function: The "adding" function is used to add two integers and reduce the result modulo "mod". We can replace this function with a simple addition operation followed by a modulo operation.

7. Use constants for loop limits: The loop limits in the nested "FOR" loops can be replaced with constants, as they are fixed values.

8. Use a more efficient algorithm: The current algorithm has a time complexity of O(62^4), which can be improved. We can use dynamic programming to optimize the algorithm and reduce the time complexity.
