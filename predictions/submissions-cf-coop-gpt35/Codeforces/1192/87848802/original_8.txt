First, let's analyze the code and identify potential areas for optimization:

1. The code includes unnecessary macros such as `x`, `y`, `pb`, `eb`, `all`, `SZ`, `FOR`, `ROF`, `make_unique`. These macros can be replaced with their actual code to improve code readability.

2. The code uses `unordered_map<string, bool>` to store strings. However, the strings stored in the map are only used as keys, and the corresponding values are always true. This can be replaced with `unordered_set<string>` to improve memory usage.

3. The `dict()` function converts a character to an integer. This can be optimized by using an array or a lookup table instead of multiple conditions.

4. The `adding()` function can be replaced with the `+=` operator for simplicity.

5. The `add()` and `mul()` functions can be replaced with the `%` operator for simplicity.

6. The `play()` function calculates a value based on the `dp` array. This function can be simplified by using the `dp` array directly.

7. The code uses nested loops to calculate values for the `dp` array. This can potentially be optimized by using loop unrolling or tail recursion.

8. The code uses nested loops to calculate values for the `ans` variable. This can potentially be optimized by using loop unrolling or vectorization.

9. The code uses `printf()` and `scanf()` for input/output. This can be replaced with `cout` and `cin` for simplicity.

Based on these observations, we can formulate an optimization strategy as follows:

1. Replace unnecessary macros with their actual code to improve code readability.

2. Replace `unordered_map<string, bool>` with `unordered_set<string>` to improve memory usage.

3. Optimize the `dict()` function by using an array or a lookup table.

4. Replace the `adding()` function with the `+=` operator.

5. Replace the `add()` and `mul()` functions with the `%` operator.

6. Simplify the `play()` function by using the `dp` array directly.

7. Optimize the nested loops used to calculate values for the `dp` array by using loop unrolling or tail recursion.

8. Optimize the nested loops used to calculate values for the `ans` variable by using loop unrolling or vectorization.

9. Replace `printf()` and `scanf()` with `cout` and `cin` for simplicity.

Let's now proceed with the step-by-step explanation and provide the optimized code.
