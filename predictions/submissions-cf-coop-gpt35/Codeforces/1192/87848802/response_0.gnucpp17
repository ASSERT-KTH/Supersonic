Code Analysis:

1. The code uses a lot of macros for convenience, but they make the code harder to read and understand. It would be better to replace these macros with explicit function calls or variable names.

2. The code uses a 3-dimensional array `dp` and a 3-dimensional array `way` to store intermediate results. These arrays consume a significant amount of memory, especially when `N` is large. There may be more memory-efficient alternatives.

3. The code uses an `unordered_map` to store whether a string has been encountered before. This map is used to avoid counting the same string multiple times. However, using an unordered map introduces additional memory overhead and can slow down the program.

4. The code uses nested loops to iterate over the arrays `way` and `dp`. These nested loops can be optimized to reduce the number of iterations and improve performance.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Replace macros with explicit function calls or variable names:
   - Replace `all(a)` with `a.begin()` and `a.end()`.
   - Replace `SZ(a)` with `a.size()`.
   - Replace `pb` with `push_back`.
   - Replace `eb` with `emplace_back`.
   - Replace `x` and `y` with more descriptive variable names.

2. Replace the 3-dimensional arrays `dp` and `way` with more memory-efficient alternatives:
   - The `dp` array can be replaced with a 2-dimensional array, as only two dimensions are used.
   - The `way` array can be replaced with a 1-dimensional array, as the third dimension is not used.

3. Replace the `unordered_map` with a more memory-efficient alternative:
   - Instead of storing a boolean value for each string, we can use a `set` to store the unique strings encountered so far.

4. Optimize the nested loops:
   - The nested loops can be rearranged to reduce the number of iterations and improve performance.
