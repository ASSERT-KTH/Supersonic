The given code appears to solve a problem related to string manipulation. However, the code contains several areas that can be optimized for better performance and memory usage.

1. Unnecessary Libraries: The code includes the entire `<bits/stdc++.h>` library, which is not recommended as it includes unnecessary headers. Instead, we should include only the required headers, such as `<iostream>`, `<unordered_map>`, and `<cstring>`.

2. Macro Definitions: The code uses several macro definitions, such as `x`, `y`, `pb`, `eb`, `all`, `SZ`, `FOR`, `ROF`, and `make_unique`. These macros can be replaced with regular functions or inline functions to improve code readability and eliminate potential macro expansion issues.

3. Unnecessary Data Structures: The code uses an `unordered_map` named `mp` to keep track of whether a string has been encountered before. However, this map is not used after the initial check and can be eliminated to save memory.

4. Redundant Reversal: The code reverses the string `s` before checking it in the `mp` map. However, reversing the string is unnecessary and can be removed without affecting the functionality.

5. Loop Optimization: The nested loops in the `solve` function can be optimized by reducing the number of iterations and eliminating unnecessary calculations.

6. Magic Numbers: The code uses several magic numbers, such as 62 and 998244353. It is unclear what these numbers represent, so they should be replaced with meaningful constants or variables with appropriate names.

Based on these observations, the proposed optimization strategy is as follows:

1. Remove unnecessary libraries and replace them with the required headers.
2. Replace the macro definitions with regular functions or inline functions.
3. Remove the `mp` unordered_map and the unnecessary string reversal.
4. Optimize the nested loops in the `solve` function.
5. Replace magic numbers with meaningful constants or variables.
