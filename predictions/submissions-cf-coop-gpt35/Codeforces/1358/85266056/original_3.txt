Analysis:

1. The code includes unnecessary header files that are not used in the program. Removing these header files will improve compile time and reduce memory usage.

2. The `using namespace std;` statement is used, which can lead to naming conflicts and make the code less maintainable. It is better to explicitly specify the namespace for each identifier.

3. The code uses a `vector<long long>` to store the input values, and then appends the same values to the vector again. This doubles the size of the vector and results in unnecessary memory usage. 

4. The function `getSum` calculates the sum of numbers from 1 to n using the formula n * (n + 1) / 2. This function can be optimized further.

5. The code uses two loops to calculate the cumulative sums of the elements in the `u` vector and the cumulative sums of the elements in the `z` vector. This can be combined into a single loop to improve efficiency.

6. The code uses a sliding window approach to find the maximum sum of consecutive elements that is less than or equal to x. This approach can be optimized further.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Remove unnecessary header files to reduce compilation time and memory usage.

2. Avoid using `using namespace std;` and explicitly specify the namespace for each identifier.

3. Eliminate the duplication of input values in the vector `v`.

4. Optimize the `getSum` function to calculate the sum of numbers from 1 to n in a more efficient way.

5. Combine the loops that calculate the cumulative sums of the elements in the `u` and `z` vectors into a single loop.

6. Optimize the sliding window approach to find the maximum sum of consecutive elements that is less than or equal to x.

Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. Remove unnecessary header files:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
```

2. Avoid using `using namespace std;` and explicitly specify the namespace for each identifier:

```cpp
using std::cin;
using std::cout;
using std::vector;
```

3. Eliminate the duplication of input values in the vector `v`:

```cpp
vector<long long> v(n);
for (long long i = 0; i < n; i++)
  cin >> v[i];
```

4. Optimize the `getSum` function to calculate the sum of numbers from 1 to n in a more efficient way. Instead of using the formula n * (n + 1) / 2, we can use the formula n * (n + 1) / 2, which avoids the division operation:

```cpp
long long getSum(long long n) {
  return n * (n + 1) >> 1;
}
```

5. Combine the loops that calculate the cumulative sums of the elements in the `u` and `z` vectors into a single loop. This reduces the number of iterations and improves efficiency:

```cpp
vector<long long> u = v;
vector<long long> z(n);
long long u_sum = 0;
long long z_sum = 0;
for (long long i = 0; i < n; i++) {
  u_sum += u[i];
  u[i] = u_sum;
  z_sum += v[i] * (v[i] + 1) / 2;
  z[i] = z_sum;
}
```

6. Optimize the sliding window approach to find the maximum sum of consecutive elements that is less than or equal to x. Instead of using nested loops, we can use a single loop with two pointers to achieve the same result. This reduces the number of iterations and improves efficiency:

```cpp
long long ans = 0;
int s = 0, e = 0;
long long days = 0, sums = 0;
while (e < v.size()) {
  days += v[e];
  sums += z[e];
  e++;
  while (days > x) {
    days -= v[s];
    sums -= z[s];
    s++;
  }
  long long diff = max(days - x, 0LL);
  ans = max(ans, sums - z[e - 1] + z[s - 1] - z[s - 1 + diff]);
}
```

7. Output the result:

```cpp
cout << ans;
```

Optimized Code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using std::cin;
using std::cout;
using std::vector;

long long getSum(long long n) {
  return n * (n + 1) >> 1;
}

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  
  long long n, x;
  cin >> n >> x;

  vector<long long> v(n);
  for (long long i = 0; i < n; i++)
    cin >> v[i];

  vector<long long> u = v;
  vector<long long> z(n);
  long long u_sum = 0;
  long long z_sum = 0;
  for (long long i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    u_sum += u[i];
    u[i] = u_sum;
    z_sum += v[i] * (v[i] + 1) / 2;
    z[i] = z_sum;
  }

  long long ans = 0;
  int s = 0, e = 0;
  long long days = 0, sums = 0;
  while (e < v.size()) {
    days += v[e];
    sums += z[e];
    e++;
    while (days > x) {
      days -= v[s];
      sums -= z[s];
      s++;
    }
    long long diff = max(days - x, 0LL);
    ans = max(ans, sums - z[e - 1] + z[s - 1] - z[s - 1 + diff]);
  }

  cout << ans;

  return 0;
}
```
