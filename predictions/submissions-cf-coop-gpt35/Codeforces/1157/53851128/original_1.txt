Code Analysis:
1. The code includes several unnecessary header files. For example, <deque>, <list>, <map>, <queue>, <set> are not used in the given code and can be removed.
2. There are several unnecessary #define statements and typedefs that are not used in the code. These can also be removed to simplify the code.
3. The code uses a lot of unnecessary macros for common operations like push_back, insert, erase, etc. These macros can be replaced with their respective functions, which will improve code readability.
4. The code uses unnecessary macros for loop indexing. The 'rep' macro can be replaced with a simple 'for' loop.
5. The code uses unnecessary macros for accessing the first and second elements of a pair. These can be replaced with the dot operator.
6. The code includes a lot of unnecessary print functions and input functions. These can be removed to improve performance.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Remove unnecessary header files: Remove unnecessary #include statements for <deque>, <list>, <map>, <queue>, and <set>.
2. Remove unnecessary macros: Remove unnecessary macros for common operations like push_back, insert, erase, etc. Replace them with their respective functions.
3. Replace macros for loop indexing: Replace the 'rep' macro with a simple 'for' loop.
4. Replace macros for accessing pair elements: Replace macros for accessing the first and second elements of a pair with the dot operator.
5. Remove unnecessary print and input functions: Remove unnecessary print and input functions to improve performance.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Remove unnecessary header files: Remove unnecessary #include statements for <deque>, <list>, <map>, <queue>, and <set>. These header files are not used in the code and including them unnecessarily increases compilation time and memory usage.

2. Remove unnecessary macros: Replace the unnecessary macros for common operations like push_back, insert, erase, etc. with their respective functions. This will improve code readability and reduce the number of macros in the code.

3. Replace macros for loop indexing: Replace the 'rep' macro with a simple 'for' loop. This will improve code readability and eliminate the need for a macro for loop indexing.

4. Replace macros for accessing pair elements: Replace the macros for accessing the first and second elements of a pair with the dot operator. This will make the code more concise and easier to understand.

5. Remove unnecessary print and input functions: Remove unnecessary print and input functions to improve performance. These functions are not used in the code and including them unnecessarily increases compilation time and memory usage.

Optimized Code Block:
```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <map>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  vector<int> va(n), vb(n);

  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> va[i];
  }

  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> vb[i];
  }

  map<int, int> stb;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    stb[vb[i] % n]++;
  }

  vector<int> vc;
  for (auto i : va) {
    auto it = stb.lower_bound((n - i) % n);
    if (it != stb.end() && (*it + i) % n < (*stb.begin()).first + i % n) {
      vc.push_back((*it + i) % n);
      stb.erase(it);
    } else {
      vc.push_back((*stb.begin()).first + i % n);
      stb.erase(stb.begin());
    }
  }

  for (auto i : vc) {
    cout << i << " ";
  }
  cout << endl;

  return 0;
}
