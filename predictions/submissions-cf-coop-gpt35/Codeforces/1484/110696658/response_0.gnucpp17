The given code appears to be a solution to a problem, but without the problem statement it is difficult to determine the exact functionality of the code. Nonetheless, we can still identify some potential optimizations based on the structure and logic of the code.

1. Unnecessary Includes: The code includes several unnecessary headers, such as `<ext/pb_ds/assoc_container.hpp>` and `<ext/pb_ds/tree_policy.hpp>`. These headers are not used in the code and can be removed.

2. Redundant Printing: The code contains a lot of printing statements using the `debugg` macro. These printing statements can be disabled or removed entirely to improve runtime performance.

3. Redundant Function Definitions: The code defines several functions, such as `split` and `operator<<`, that are not used in the code. These function definitions can be removed to reduce the code size and improve compilation time.

4. Optimization Pragmas: The code does not make use of any compiler optimization pragmas. Adding pragmas such as `#pragma GCC optimize` or `#pragma clang optimize` with relevant optimization flags can hint the compiler to optimize the code further.

5. Data Structure Optimization: The code uses a `vector<pair<int, vector<int>>>` to store the input data. This data structure can be optimized by replacing it with a more efficient data structure, such as a `vector<pair<int, array<int, N>>>`, where `N` is a fixed upper limit on the number of elements in the input.

6. Redundant Loop Variables: The code uses the variable `x` in multiple nested loops, resulting in unnecessary memory allocation and deallocation. Reusing the same variable for different purposes can improve performance by reducing memory usage.

7. Unnecessary Map Operations: The code uses a `map<int, int>` to store frequency counts of elements. However, the frequency counts are updated in a loop, which can be replaced with a simple array or vector to improve performance.

8. Minimizing Memory Allocation: The code allocates memory for the `res` vector with size `m`, even though it is only used to store `m` elements. Allocating memory for only the required number of elements can reduce memory usage.
