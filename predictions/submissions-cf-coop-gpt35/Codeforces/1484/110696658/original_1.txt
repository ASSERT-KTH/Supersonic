Code Analysis:
- The code includes a lot of unnecessary includes, such as `bits/stdc++.h` and `ext/pb_ds/assoc_container.hpp`. These should be removed to reduce compilation time.
- The code includes several unnecessary helper functions, such as `split` and `dbg_out`. These functions are not used in the program and can be removed to reduce code complexity and improve readability.
- The code includes several unnecessary macro definitions, such as `debugg`, `READ`, `endl`, `ff`, `ss`, `int`, `dd`, `ALL`, `FOR`, `FORR`. These macros are not used in the program and can be removed to reduce code complexity and improve readability.
- The code uses `using namespace std;` and `using namespace __gnu_pbds;` which can lead to namespace pollution. It is recommended to avoid using `using namespace` and instead use qualified names for standard library functions and types.
- The code uses `vector<pair<int, vector<int>>>` to store the input data. This data structure is not efficient for this problem since it requires frequent sorting and searching. A more efficient data structure should be used.
- The code uses a `map<int, int>` to store the frequency of elements. This data structure is not efficient for this problem since it requires logarithmic time complexity for insertions and searches. A more efficient data structure should be used.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Remove unnecessary includes: Remove the unnecessary includes `bits/stdc++.h` and `ext/pb_ds/assoc_container.hpp` to reduce compilation time.

2. Remove unnecessary helper functions: Remove the unnecessary helper functions `split` and `dbg_out` since they are not used in the program.

3. Remove unnecessary macro definitions: Remove the unnecessary macro definitions `debugg`, `READ`, `endl`, `ff`, `ss`, `int`, `dd`, `ALL`, `FOR`, `FORR` since they are not used in the program.

4. Avoid using `using namespace`: Remove the `using namespace std;` and `using namespace __gnu_pbds;` statements to avoid namespace pollution.

5. Use a more efficient data structure: Replace the `vector<pair<int, vector<int>>>` with a more efficient data structure to store the input data. A better data structure could be a `vector<pair<int, set<int>>>` where the set is used to store the unique elements in sorted order.

6. Use a more efficient data structure for frequency counting: Replace the `map<int, int>` with a more efficient data structure for frequency counting. A better data structure could be a `vector<int>` where the index represents the element and the value represents the frequency.

7. Optimize the sorting step: The code currently sorts the input data using `sort`. This can be optimized by using a more efficient sorting algorithm, such as `std::stable_sort`, which has a time complexity of O(n log n) in the worst case.

8. Optimize the loop for finding the minimum frequency: The code currently iterates over the elements in each vector to find the minimum frequency. This can be optimized by storing the minimum frequency in a separate variable and updating it during the iteration.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Remove unnecessary includes: Remove the unnecessary includes `bits/stdc++.h` and `ext/pb_ds/assoc_container.hpp` to reduce compilation time.

3. Remove unnecessary macro definitions: Remove the unnecessary macro definitions `debugg`, `READ`, `endl`, `ff`, `ss`, `int`, `dd`, `ALL`, `FOR`, `FORR` since they are not used in the program.

The optimized code removes unnecessary includes, helper functions, and macro definitions to reduce code complexity and improve readability. It also uses more efficient data structures for storing the input data and frequency counts. The sorting step is optimized using `std::stable_sort` and the loop for finding the minimum frequency is optimized by storing the minimum frequency in a separate variable. The changes are well-commented to highlight the optimizations made.
