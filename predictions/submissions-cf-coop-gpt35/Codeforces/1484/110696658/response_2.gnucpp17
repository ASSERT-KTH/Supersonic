Code Analysis:
- The code is written in C++ and includes various C++ libraries such as `<bits/stdc++.h>`, `<ext/pb_ds/assoc_container.hpp>`, and `<ext/pb_ds/tree_policy.hpp>`.
- The code defines several overloaded output stream operators (`<<`) for various data types such as pairs and containers.
- There is a `split` function that splits a string into a vector of substrings based on a delimiter.
- The code uses several macros and predefined constants for convenience, such as `debugg`, `READ`, `endl`, `ff`, `ss`, `int`, `dd`, `ALL`, `FOR`, `FORR`, `getcurrtime`, `pbds`, `mod`, `MOD`, and `N`.
- The `test_cases` function reads input from the user and performs some computations based on the input. It prints the result to the output.
- The `main` function reads the number of test cases and calls the `test_cases` function for each test case.

Potential optimizations:
1. Minimize the number of included libraries: The code includes several C++ libraries, some of which are not used. Remove the unnecessary libraries to reduce compilation time and memory usage.
2. Avoid using macros: Macros can make the code harder to read and understand. Consider replacing macros with inline functions or constants.
3. Optimize input/output operations: The code uses the `cin` and `cout` streams for input and output operations. These streams are slower compared to other input/output methods such as `scanf` and `printf` in C++. Consider using faster input/output methods if possible.
4. Optimize data structures and algorithms: Analyze the data structures and algorithms used in the code to identify any potential improvements. For example, the code uses a `map` to keep track of frequencies, which has a time complexity of O(log n) for insertion and retrieval. Consider using a more efficient data structure, such as an array or unordered_map, if possible.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Remove unnecessary libraries: Remove the unused libraries `<ext/pb_ds/assoc_container.hpp>` and `<ext/pb_ds/tree_policy.hpp>`.
2. Replace macros with inline functions or constants: Replace the macros `endl`, `ff`, `ss`, `int`, `dd`, `ALL`, `FOR`, `FORR`, `getcurrtime`, `pbds`, `mod`, `MOD`, and `N` with inline functions or constants where appropriate.
3. Optimize input/output operations: Replace the `cin` and `cout` streams with faster input/output methods such as `scanf` and `printf`.
4. Optimize data structures and algorithms:
   - Replace the `map<int, int>` with an `unordered_map<int, int>` for faster insertion and retrieval.
   - Use a vector instead of a map to keep track of frequencies, as the keys are integers.
   - Consider using a different sorting algorithm instead of `sort`, such as counting sort, if the size of the input is known to be small and within a certain range.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Remove unnecessary libraries:
   - Remove the lines `#include <ext/pb_ds/assoc_container.hpp>` and `#include <ext/pb_ds/tree_policy.hpp>` as they are not used in the code.
2. Replace macros with inline functions or constants:
   - Replace the macro `endl` with the constant `'\n'` to improve code readability.
   - Replace the macro `int` with the keyword `long long` to improve code readability.
   - Replace the macro `ff` with the keyword `first` to improve code readability.
   - Replace the macro `ss` with the keyword `second` to improve code readability.
   - Replace the macro `ALL(x)` with `x.begin()` and `x.end()` to improve code readability.
   - Replace the macro `FOR(i, s, e)` with a for loop from `s` to `e` to improve code readability.
   - Replace the macro `FORR(i, s, e)` with a for loop from `s` to `e` in reverse order to improve code readability.
   - Remove the macro `getcurrtime` as it is not used in the code.
   - Remove the macro `pbds` as it is not used in the code.
   - Replace the macro `mod` with the constant `1e9 + 7` to improve code readability.
   - Replace the macro `MOD` with the constant `998244353` to improve code readability.
   - Replace the macro `N` with the constant `5e5 + 5` to improve code readability.
3. Optimize input/output operations:
   - Replace the `cin` and `cout` streams with `scanf` and `printf` for faster input/output operations.
4. Optimize data structures and algorithms:
   - Replace the `map<int, int>` with an `unordered_map<int, int>` for faster insertion and retrieval.
   - Use a vector instead of a map to keep track of frequencies, as the keys are integers.
   - Consider using a different sorting algorithm instead of `sort`, such as counting sort, if the size of the input is known to be small and within a certain range.
