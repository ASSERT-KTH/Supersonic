Code Analysis:
- The code includes several unnecessary header files.
- The `operator<<` overloads and `split` function seem to be used for debugging purposes and can be removed.
- The `READ_OUT` and `READ` macros can be simplified.
- The `debugg` macro can be removed.
- The `ff` and `ss` macros can be removed.
- The `int` type is used instead of `long long` for the `fr` map, which can result in overflow.
- The `pbds` alias is not used and can be removed.
- The code does not have any explicit optimizations specified.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Remove unnecessary header files: The `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` and `#include <ext/pb_ds/assoc_container.hpp>` can be removed as they are not used in the code.

2. Remove debugging functions: The `operator<<` overloads, `split` function, and related macros (`debugg`, `READ_OUT`, `READ`) are not necessary for the optimized code and can be removed.

3. Simplify input reading: The `READ` macro can be simplified by directly using `cin` to read the inputs.

4. Replace `int` with `long long` for `fr` map: Since the values in the `fr` map can potentially exceed the range of `int`, it should be declared as `map<int, long long>` to avoid overflow.

5. Add compiler optimizations: Add compiler optimizations, such as `-O3`, to enable higher levels of optimization during compilation.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Remove unnecessary header files:
   - The `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` and `#include <ext/pb_ds/assoc_container.hpp>` are not used in the code and can be removed.

2. Remove debugging functions:
   - The `operator<<` overloads and `split` function are not necessary for the optimized code and can be removed.
   - Remove the `debugg` macro as it calls the `dbg_out` function, which is part of the removed debugging functions.
   - Simplify the `READ_OUT` and `READ` macros by directly using `cin` to read the inputs.

3. Simplify input reading:
   - Replace the `READ_OUT` and `READ` macros with a simpler input reading method using `cin`.

4. Replace `int` with `long long` for `fr` map:
   - Change the declaration of `map<int, int> fr` to `map<int, long long> fr` to avoid overflow if the values in the `fr` map exceed the range of `int`.

5. Add compiler optimizations:
   - Add compiler optimizations, such as `-O3`, to enable higher levels of optimization during compilation.
