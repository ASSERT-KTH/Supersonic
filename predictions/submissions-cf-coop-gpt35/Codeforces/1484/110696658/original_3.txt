Upon analyzing the given code, I have identified several potential areas for optimization:

1. Unnecessary includes: The code includes unnecessary headers like `<bits/stdc++.h>` and `<ext/pb_ds/assoc_container.hpp>`. These headers can be removed as they are not used in the code.

2. Redundant data structure: The code uses a `map<int, int>` named `fr` to keep track of the frequency of numbers. However, this data structure is not necessary and can be replaced with a simple array or vector.

3. Sorting unnecessary data: The code sorts the vector `a` based on the size of the inner vector `ss`. However, this sorting is not required for the logic of the program and can be removed.

4. Inefficient loop: The code uses a nested loop to find the minimum value in a vector, which results in a time complexity of O(n^2). This can be optimized to O(n) by using a variable to keep track of the minimum value.

5. Redundant use of `endl`: The code uses `endl` to end each line of output, which flushes the output stream. This can significantly impact performance. Replacing `endl` with `'\n'` can improve performance.

Based on these observations, I will now provide an optimized version of the code.
