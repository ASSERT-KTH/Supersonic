The given code performs a graph traversal operation and calculates the sum of distances between pairs of nodes in a tree. The code uses several data structures such as vectors and queues to store and process the graph nodes. However, there are several areas where the code can be optimized to improve performance and reduce memory usage. 

1. Avoid using the `bits/stdc++.h` header: This header includes almost all the standard library headers, which can result in a significant increase in compilation time and unnecessary memory usage. It is better to include only the required headers, such as `<iostream>`, `<vector>`, and `<queue>`.

2. Remove unnecessary defines: The code defines the value of PI and the array size N, but these constants are not used anywhere in the code. It is recommended to remove these unnecessary defines to improve code clarity.

3. Use forward declarations: The code defines several functions before they are used. Instead, it is better to use forward declarations for these functions to improve code readability.

4. Avoid using global variables: The code uses several global variables to store intermediate results and flags. Instead, it is better to encapsulate these variables within a class or a function to avoid global namespace pollution and improve code maintainability.

5. Use range-based for loops: The code uses traditional for loops to iterate over vectors. It is better to use range-based for loops to improve code readability and reduce the chances of off-by-one errors.

6. Use references instead of passing large objects by value: The code passes vectors and pairs by value to functions, which can result in unnecessary copying of large objects. It is better to pass these objects by reference to avoid the overhead of copying.

7. Optimize the `euler` function: The `euler` function performs a recursive traversal of the graph using a depth-first search approach. This function can be optimized by using an iterative approach, such as using a stack instead of recursion. This will reduce the function call overhead and improve performance.

8. Optimize the `sparsemin` function: The `sparsemin` function computes the sparse table to find the minimum value in a range efficiently. This function can be optimized by using a more memory-efficient data structure, such as a segment tree or a Fenwick tree, instead of a 2D array.

9. Optimize the `bfs` function: The `bfs` function performs a breadth-first search traversal of the graph. This function can be optimized by removing the unnecessary initialization of the `vis` array inside the function. Instead, the `vis` array can be declared as a global variable and initialized once outside the function.

10. Optimize the main loop: The main loop of the code performs several calculations and updates the `ans` variable. This loop can be optimized by using range-based for loops instead of traditional for loops and by avoiding unnecessary calculations inside the loop.

Now, let's apply these optimization strategies step-by-step and optimize the given code.
