The given code appears to be solving a graph problem related to finding the diameter of a tree and calculating the sum of distances between pairs of nodes. However, the code seems to have several areas that can be optimized for better performance. Let's analyze the code and propose optimization strategies.

1. Avoid unnecessary includes: The code includes `<bits/stdc++.h>`, which is not a standard C++ header file and is known to slow down compilation time. It is recommended to include only the necessary standard headers that are actually used in the code.

2. Avoid using macros for constants: The code defines the constant PI and array size N using macros. Using macros for constants can lead to unexpected behavior and can be error-prone. It is better to use `const` variables or `constexpr` in C++.

3. Avoid using global variables: The code uses several global variables, which can make the code harder to understand and maintain. It is recommended to encapsulate related variables into structs or classes and pass them as function arguments instead.

4. Use references instead of passing large objects by value: The functions `height_initialise`, `distanc`, `euler`, `diameter`, `euler_tour`, `sparsemin` all take parameters by value. Since these parameters are vectors or large objects, it is more efficient to pass them by reference to avoid unnecessary copying.

5. Use range-based loops instead of index-based loops: The code uses index-based loops with the `size()` function to iterate over vectors. It is more efficient to use range-based loops, which eliminate the need for indexing and potentially improve cache locality.

6. Avoid unnecessary reverse operation: The code reverses the `path` vector using the `reverse` function. Since the vector is built in reverse order in the first place, this operation is unnecessary and can be removed.

7. Optimize the `sparsemin` function: The `sparsemin` function uses a 2D array to store the minimum values of a range. This can be optimized by using a 2D vector instead, which avoids the need for a large contiguous memory block. Additionally, the `sparsemin` function can be made more efficient by calculating the values in a bottom-up manner instead of top-down.

8. Optimize the `spminquery` function: The `spminquery` function performs a logarithmic time lookup in the `stmin` array. This can be optimized by using precomputed logarithmic values to avoid the `log2` function call. Additionally, the function can be simplified by directly comparing the heights instead of checking the heights and returning the corresponding node.

9. Optimize the `bfs` function: The `bfs` function uses a queue to perform a breadth-first search. It can be optimized by using a deque instead of a queue to avoid the `pop` operation, which has a linear time complexity for queues.

10. Optimize the `diameter` function: The `diameter` function calculates the diameter of the tree by performing two breadth-first searches. This can be simplified and optimized by performing a single breadth-first search and keeping track of the farthest node from the root.

11. Avoid unnecessary vector resizing: The code uses the `push_back` function to add elements to vectors. This can lead to frequent reallocations and copying of elements. It is more efficient to preallocate the required size of the vectors using the `reserve` function.

12. Optimize the main loop: The main loop of the code calculates the sum of distances between pairs of nodes. This calculation can be optimized by reducing the number of unnecessary calculations and removing redundant variables.
