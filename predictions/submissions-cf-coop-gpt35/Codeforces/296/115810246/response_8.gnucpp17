After analyzing the provided code, there are a few potential optimizations that can be made:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The code includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header which is not a standard C++ header and is generally discouraged. It is better to include only the necessary headers. In this case, the only necessary header is `<iostream>`.

2. Avoid using `using namespace std;`: While using the `using namespace std` directive makes the code shorter, it also brings all the names from the `std` namespace into the global namespace, which can lead to naming conflicts. It is generally better to explicitly specify the namespace, such as `std::cin` and `std::cout`.

3. Remove unnecessary typedefs: The `typedef` for `ll` and `vi` can be removed as they are not used in the code.

4. Avoid using macros: The code uses macros for constants like `el`, `PI`, `MP`, `pb`, `all`, `sz`, etc. Instead of macros, it is recommended to use `const` variables or inline functions to achieve the same effect. Macros can lead to unexpected behavior and should be avoided.

5. Efficient memory allocation: The code declares large arrays `a`, `b`, `c`, `ans`, and `op` with a fixed size, which can lead to unnecessary memory allocation. Instead, it is better to dynamically allocate memory for these arrays based on the input sizes `m` and `k`.

6. Optimize loop iterations: The code uses a loop to read the array `arr` and another loop to read the arrays `a`, `b`, and `c`. Instead of separate loops, these operations can be done within the same loop to avoid redundant iterations.

7. Optimize array indexing: The code uses array indexing with subtraction and addition operations, which can be optimized by precomputing the indices.

8. Minimize I/O operations: The code uses multiple `cin` and `cout` operations, which can be slow. Instead, it is better to use `scanf` and `printf` functions for faster I/O.
