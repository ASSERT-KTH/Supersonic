The provided code seems to be a program that performs some calculations based on user input. Here is a step-by-step analysis and optimization strategy for the code:

1. Code Analysis:
   - The code includes unnecessary header files and using namespace std, which can be removed to improve compilation time.
   - The code uses a lot of macros and typedefs, which can make the code harder to read and understand. We can replace them with their actual values to improve code clarity.
   - The code uses 1-based indexing, which can be confusing. We can convert it to 0-based indexing for simplicity.
   - The code uses arrays with fixed sizes, which can be a problem if the input size exceeds the array size. We can use dynamic memory allocation or vectors to handle variable-sized input.

2. Optimization Strategy:
   1. Remove unnecessary header files and using namespace std to improve compilation time.
   2. Replace macros and typedefs with their actual values for better code clarity.
   3. Convert 1-based indexing to 0-based indexing.
   4. Replace fixed-size arrays with dynamic memory allocation or vectors to handle variable-sized input.
   5. Optimize the loops to reduce redundant calculations.
   6. Remove unused variables and optimize memory usage.

3. Step-by-Step Explanation:
   1. Remove unnecessary header files and using namespace std:
      - The code includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header file, which is not necessary and can be removed.
      - The `using namespace std;` statement can also be removed to avoid polluting the global namespace.
   2. Replace macros and typedefs:
      - Replace the `el` macro with `'\n'` for better code clarity.
      - Replace the `PI` macro with the actual value of pi (3.14159265359).
      - Remove the `MP` macro, as it is not used in the code.
      - Replace the `pb(v)` macro with `push_back(v)` for better code clarity.
      - Replace the `all(v)` macro with `(v).begin(), (v).end()` for better code clarity.
      - Replace the `sz(v)` macro with `((int)((v).size()))` for better code clarity.
      - Replace the `clr(v, d)` macro with `memset(v, d, sizeof(v))` for better code clarity.
   3. Convert 1-based indexing to 0-based indexing:
      - Subtract 1 from the values of `x` and `y` when reading them from input to convert them to 0-based indexing.
      - Adjust the array accesses accordingly.
   4. Replace fixed-size arrays with dynamic memory allocation or vectors:
      - Replace the arrays `a`, `b`, `c`, `ans`, and `op` with vectors to handle variable-sized input.
   5. Optimize the loops:
      - In the loop that reads the input for `arr`, use the prefix increment operator (`++i`) instead of the postfix increment operator (`i++`) for better performance.
      - Combine the loops that calculate `op` and update `ans` into a single loop to reduce redundant calculations.
   6. Remove unused variables and optimize memory usage:
      - Remove the unused variables `dx`, `dy`, `EPS`, and `MOD`.
      - Avoid using unnecessary temporary variables.

4. Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <cmath>
#include <cstring>

const double PI = 3.14159265359;

void INPUT() {
#ifndef ONLINE_JUDGE
  freopen("input.txt", "r", stdin);
  freopen("output.txt", "w", stdout);
#endif
}

void OUTPUT() {
  std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  std::cin.tie(NULL);
  std::cout.tie(NULL);
}

int main() {
  INPUT();
  OUTPUT();

  int n, m, k;
  std::cin >> n >> m >> k;

  std::vector<long long> arr(n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    std::cin >> arr[i];
  }

  std::vector<long long> a(m), b(m), c(m), ans(n), op(m);
  for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
    std::cin >> a[i] >> b[i] >> c[i];
    --a[i];
    --b[i];
  }

  for (int i = 0; i < k; ++i) {
    int x, y;
    std::cin >> x >> y;
    --x;
    --y;
    ++op[x];
    --op[y];
  }

  long long prefix_op = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
    prefix_op += op[i];
    ans[a[i]] += prefix_op * c[i];
    if (b[i] + 1 < n) {
      ans[b[i] + 1] -= prefix_op * c[i];
    }
  }

  for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
    ans[i] += ans[i - 1];
  }

  std::cout << ans[0] + arr[0] << " ";
  for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
    std::cout << ans[i] + arr[i] << " ";
  }
  std::cout << '\n';

  return 0;
}
```

This optimized code preserves the functionality and output of the original code while improving its efficiency. It eliminates unnecessary header files, avoids polluting the global namespace, replaces macros and typedefs with their actual values, converts 1-based indexing to 0-based indexing, replaces fixed-size arrays with vectors, optimizes loops, removes unused variables, and optimizes memory usage.
