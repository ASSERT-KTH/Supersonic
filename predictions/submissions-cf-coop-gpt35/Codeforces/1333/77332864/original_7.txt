The given code calculates the sum of a subarray of an array `v` and counts the number of subarrays that have a sum of 0. The code uses a map to keep track of the first occurrence of each sum value and a vector to store the cumulative sum of the array elements.

However, there are several areas where the code can be optimized:

1. Input/Output: The code uses `scanf` and `printf` for input/output operations. While these functions are fast, they are not the most efficient for reading and writing integers. Using `cin` and `cout` from the `<iostream>` library can provide a more optimized solution.

2. Data Structures: The code uses a `vector` to store the cumulative sum and a `map` to store the first occurrence of each sum value. However, since the sum values are integers, an array can be used instead of a `map` to achieve faster access time.

3. Unnecessary Variables: The variable `mx` is used to keep track of the maximum index encountered so far. However, this variable is not necessary and can be removed. The maximum index can be calculated using `n - i` instead.

4. Redundant Computations: The code calculates `(n - i)` multiple times, which can be avoided by storing it in a variable.

5. Pragma Directives: The compiler can be guided to optimize the code using pragma directives. For example, using `#pragma GCC optimize ("O3")` at the beginning of the program can enable aggressive optimizations.

Based on these observations, let's optimize the code step by step:
