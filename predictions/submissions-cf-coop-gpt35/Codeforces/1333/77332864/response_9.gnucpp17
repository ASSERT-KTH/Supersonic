Code Analysis:
- The code calculates the sum of a given array `v` and then performs some calculations based on the sum.
- It uses a vector `cnt` to store the cumulative sum of the elements in `v`.
- It uses a map `mp` to store the index of the first occurrence of each cumulative sum.
- It uses a map `vis` to keep track of whether a cumulative sum has been visited before.
- The code then iterates through the array `v` and performs some calculations based on the cumulative sum.
- Finally, it prints the result.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Use `cin` and `cout` instead of `scanf` and `printf` for input and output operations. This can improve performance.
2. Replace the `map` data structure with a more efficient data structure like an array or a hash table. This can reduce memory usage and improve lookup times.
3. Pre-allocate the size of the vector `v` and the arrays `cnt`, `mp`, and `vis` to avoid unnecessary re-allocations and improve memory usage.
4. Avoid unnecessary calculations and redundant operations to improve performance.
5. Use compiler optimizations like `-O2` to enable compiler optimizations and improve code performance.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Replace `scanf` and `printf` with `cin` and `cout` respectively:
   - Rationale: `cin` and `cout` are typically faster than `scanf` and `printf` because they perform buffering and have better handling of I/O streams.
   - Trade-offs: None. This change is straightforward and does not introduce any complexity.
   
2. Replace the `map` data structure with a more efficient data structure:
   - Rationale: A `map` has a time complexity of O(log n) for lookup operations, which can be inefficient for large data sets. Using a more efficient data structure like an array or a hash table can improve lookup times.
   - Trade-offs: Using an array or a hash table may require more memory compared to a `map`, but it should be more efficient in terms of lookup times.
   
3. Pre-allocate the size of the vector `v` and the arrays `cnt`, `mp`, and `vis`:
   - Rationale: Pre-allocating the size of the vectors and arrays helps avoid unnecessary re-allocations and improves memory usage.
   - Trade-offs: This change may require predicting the size of the input data, which may not always be feasible. However, if the size is known or can be estimated, pre-allocation can be beneficial.

4. Eliminate unnecessary calculations and redundant operations:
   - Rationale: The current code performs unnecessary calculations and redundant operations that can be eliminated to improve performance.
   - Trade-offs: Eliminating unnecessary calculations and redundant operations may increase code complexity, but it should result in improved performance.

5. Use compiler optimizations like `-O2`:
   - Rationale: Compiler optimizations can help the code generate more efficient machine code and improve performance.
   - Trade-offs: Compiler optimizations may increase compilation time and may not always result in significant performance improvements.
