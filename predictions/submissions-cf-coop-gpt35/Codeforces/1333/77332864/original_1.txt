Code Analysis:
- The code calculates the sum of all subarrays in an array and outputs the result.
- It uses a map to keep track of the indices where the sum of subarrays is the same.
- It also uses a vector to store the cumulative sum of the elements in the array.
- The code has a time complexity of O(n^2) because for each element in the array, it checks all previous elements to find the subarrays with the same sum.
- The space complexity of the code is O(n) because it creates a vector and a map of size n.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Replace the vector with an array to reduce memory usage.
2. Avoid unnecessary calculations by keeping track of the current maximum index.
3. Optimize the loop by using pointers instead of array indices.
4. Use compiler optimizations and pragmas to help the compiler generate more efficient code.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Replace the vector with an array:
- The vector `v` is used to store the cumulative sum of the elements in the array.
- We can replace it with a simple array to reduce memory usage.
- Declare an array `cumulativeSum` of size n+1 to store the cumulative sum of the elements.
- Replace `v[i]` with `cumulativeSum[i]` in the code.

2. Avoid unnecessary calculations:
- The variable `mx` is used to keep track of the current maximum index.
- Instead of calculating `l` and `r` in each iteration, we can calculate them only when necessary.
- Add a condition to check if `mp[cnt[i]] - mx >= 0` before subtracting from `ans`.
- Replace `mp[cnt[i]] - mx` with a variable `diff` to improve code readability.
- Move `ans--` outside the condition to remove redundancy.

3. Optimize the loop:
- Instead of using array indices, use pointers to access elements in the array.
- Declare two pointers, `p1` and `p2`, and initialize them to the beginning and end of the array respectively.
- Use `*p1` and `*p2` to access elements in the array instead of `v[i]`.
- Increment `p1` and decrement `p2` accordingly in the loop.

4. Use compiler optimizations and pragmas:
- Add compiler optimizations flags, such as `-O2`, to enable compiler optimizations.
- Use `#pragma` directives to provide hints to the compiler for optimizing certain parts of the code.

Optimized Code:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int n;
  scanf("%d", &n);

  long long ans = n * 1LL * (n + 1) / 2LL;

  long long cumulativeSum[n + 1] = {0};
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++)
    scanf("%lld", &cumulativeSum[i]);

  map<long long, long long> mp, vis;
  mp[0] = 0;
  vis[0] = 1;
  long long mx = 0;

  long long *p1 = cumulativeSum + 1;
  long long *p2 = cumulativeSum + n;

  for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    if (vis[*p1]) {
      long long diff = mp[*p1] - mx;
      long long l = max(0LL, diff);
      long long r = p2 - p1;
      if (diff >= 0) {
        ans -= (l * r) + l + r;
        if (i - mp[*p1] != n || !mx)
          ans--;
      }
      mx = max(mp[*p1] + 1, mx);
    }
    mp[*p1] = i;
    vis[*p1] = 1;

    p1++;
  }

  printf("%lld\n", ans);
}
```

The optimized code reduces memory usage by replacing the vector with an array and improves the loop by using pointers instead of array indices. It also avoids unnecessary calculations by keeping track of the current maximum index and optimizes the if condition. Compiler optimizations and pragmas can be added to further enhance the performance.
