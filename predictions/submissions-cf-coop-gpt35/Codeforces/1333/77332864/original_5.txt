Code Analysis:

1. The code reads an integer `n` from input and then reads `n` long long integers into a vector `v`.
2. It calculates the prefix sum of the `v` vector into the `cnt` vector.
3. It uses a map `mp` to store the last position of each prefix sum value.
4. It uses a map `vis` to check if a prefix sum value has been seen before.
5. It iterates over the `cnt` vector and performs calculations to update the answer variable `ans`.
6. Finally, it prints the value of `ans`.

Potential Performance Bottlenecks:

1. The code uses a map to store the last position of each prefix sum value. This can result in slow performance due to the overhead of map operations.
2. The code uses a vector `cnt` to store the prefix sum values. This requires additional memory and can impact performance if the vector becomes large.
3. The code uses the `max` function repeatedly, which can be computationally expensive.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Replace the use of a map with a more efficient data structure that can provide constant time lookup, such as an unordered_map.
2. Eliminate the need for the `cnt` vector by calculating the prefix sum values directly in the loop.
3. Replace the use of the `max` function with a simple comparison operator to improve performance.
4. Use compiler optimizations to further improve performance.

Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. Replace the map with an unordered_map:
   - Rationale: The map lookup operation has a time complexity of O(log n), while the unordered_map has a time complexity of O(1). This will significantly improve performance.
   - Trade-offs: The unordered_map may have a slightly higher memory overhead compared to the map, but this is usually negligible.

2. Calculate the prefix sum values directly in the loop:
   - Rationale: The current code uses an additional vector `cnt` to store the prefix sum values. By calculating the prefix sum values directly in the loop, we can eliminate the need for this extra memory.
   - Trade-offs: None. This optimization reduces memory usage without introducing any trade-offs.

3. Replace the `max` function with a simple comparison operator:
   - Rationale: The `max` function has a time complexity of O(1), but it incurs some overhead due to function call and return operations. By using a simple comparison operator, we can eliminate this overhead and improve performance.
   - Trade-offs: None. This optimization improves performance without introducing any trade-offs.

4. Use compiler optimizations:
   - Rationale: Modern compilers can perform various optimizations that can significantly improve the performance of the code. Enabling compiler optimizations can make the code more efficient without making any manual changes to the code.
   - Trade-offs: None. Compiler optimizations are applied automatically and do not introduce any trade-offs.

Optimized Code:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int n;
  scanf("%d", &n);
  long long ans = n * 1LL * (n + 1) / 2LL;
  vector<long long> v(n + 1);
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++)
    scanf("%lld", &v[i]);
  unordered_map<long long, long long> mp, vis;
  mp[0] = 0;
  vis[0] = 1;
  long long mx = 0;
  long long cnt = 0;
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    cnt += v[i];
    if (vis[cnt]) {
      long long l = (mp[cnt] > mx) ? mp[cnt] - mx : 0;
      long long r = n - i;
      if (mp[cnt] - mx >= 0) {
        ans -= (l * r) + l + r;
        if (i - mp[cnt] != n || !mx)
          ans--;
      }
      mx = max(mp[cnt] + 1, mx);
    }
    mp[cnt] = i;
    vis[cnt] = 1;
  }
  printf("%lld\n", ans);
  return 0;
}
```
