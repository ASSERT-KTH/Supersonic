Code Analysis:
- The code calculates the sum of a sequence of numbers and then performs some calculations based on the sequence.
- It uses a map to keep track of the indices of previously encountered sums and a vector to store the cumulative sums.
- The code has a time complexity of O(n^2) because it iterates over each element and checks if the sum has been seen before in the map.
- The code uses a lot of unnecessary data structures and calculations, which can be optimized.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Replace the use of `scanf` with `cin` for input and `printf` with `cout` for output. This will improve the I/O performance.
2. Instead of using a map to track the indices of previously encountered sums, use an unordered_map for faster lookup.
3. Instead of using a vector to store the cumulative sums, calculate the sum on the fly using a variable.
4. Remove the unnecessary `vis` vector as it is not used.
5. Instead of using a map to keep track of the maximum index of a sum, use a variable to store the maximum index.
6. Simplify the calculation of `l` and `r` to avoid unnecessary calculations.
7. Optimize the loop by removing unnecessary calculations and simplify the conditions.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Replace `scanf` with `cin` for input and `printf` with `cout` for output. This will improve the I/O performance as `cin` and `cout` are faster than `scanf` and `printf`.
2. Replace the map `mp` with an unordered_map. This will improve the lookup time from O(log n) to O(1).
3. Remove the `vis` vector as it is not used in the code.
4. Calculate the sum on the fly instead of using a vector to store the cumulative sums. This will reduce memory usage.
5. Replace the map `mp` with a variable `mx` to store the maximum index of a sum. This will reduce memory usage and simplify the code.
6. Simplify the calculation of `l` and `r` by removing unnecessary calculations. The condition `mp[cnt[i]] - mx >= 0` can be simplified to `mp[cnt[i]] >= mx`.
7. Simplify the conditions in the loop to avoid unnecessary calculations. The condition `i - mp[cnt[i]] != n || !mx` can be simplified to `i != n || !mx`.

Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  long long ans = n * 1LL * (n + 1) / 2LL;
  unordered_map<long long, long long> mp;
  long long mx = 0;
  long long cnt = 0;
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    long long x;
    cin >> x;
    cnt += x;
    if (mp.count(cnt)) {
      long long l = mp[cnt] - mx;
      long long r = n - i;
      if (mp[cnt] >= mx) {
        ans -= (l * r) + l + r;
        if (i != n || !mx)
          ans--;
      }
      mx = max(mp[cnt] + 1, mx);
    }
    mp[cnt] = i;
  }
  cout << ans << endl;
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized code improves the performance by reducing unnecessary data structures and calculations. It also simplifies the code without changing the functionality or output of the original code.
