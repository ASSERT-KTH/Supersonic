The given code appears to be a solution to a problem that involves counting the number of consecutive cells with the same character in a grid. The code reads the grid, computes two arrays `ng` and `dc` to store the number of consecutive cells horizontally and vertically, and then answers a series of queries by computing the result based on these arrays.

To optimize this code, we can focus on the following aspects:

1. Avoid unnecessary memory usage: The code currently uses two 2D arrays, `ng` and `dc`, to store the counts of consecutive cells. However, this is not necessary as we can calculate these counts on-the-fly. Thus, we can eliminate the `ng` and `dc` arrays to reduce memory usage.

2. Avoid redundant computations: The code currently computes the counts of consecutive cells for each cell in the grid. However, we can optimize this by computing the counts only once for each row and column. This can be achieved by precomputing the counts for each row and column and storing them in separate arrays.

3. Optimize the query computation: The code currently uses nested loops to iterate over the cells in the query range and compute the result. However, this can be optimized by using the precomputed counts to directly calculate the result without the need for nested loops.

Based on these optimizations, the optimized code can be as follows:
