The given code appears to be a C++ program that reads an input grid of characters, performs some calculations on the grid, and then outputs the results based on given queries. 

To optimize this code, we can focus on the following aspects:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The code includes the entire `<bits/stdc++.h>` library, which can slow down compilation time. We can remove this line and include only the required standard headers.

2. Remove unnecessary macros: The code contains several macros that are not used in the program. We can remove these macros to simplify the code.

3. Avoid redundant computations: The code has redundant computations in the nested loops that initialize the `ng` and `dc` arrays. We can optimize these computations to avoid unnecessary operations.

4. Optimize grid traversal: The code uses nested loops to iterate over the grid, which can be optimized to improve performance.

5. Optimize queries: The code uses nested loops to calculate the results for each query. We can optimize this part to improve efficiency.

Based on these observations, let's proceed with the optimization steps.
