After analyzing the code, I have identified the following potential optimization opportunities:

1. Unnecessary includes: The code includes the entire `<bits/stdc++.h>` header, which is not recommended. It is better to include only the necessary headers.

2. Unnecessary macros: The code defines macros for looping, which can be replaced with standard for-loops. Using macros can make the code less readable and harder to maintain.

3. Redundant checks: The code checks if `a[i][j]` is equal to `a[i][j-1]` and `a[i][j]` is equal to `a[i-1][j]` twice. This check can be combined into a single check.

4. Redundant initialization: The arrays `ng` and `dc` are initialized to 0, but this is unnecessary since they will be overwritten in the loop.

5. Redundant memory usage: The arrays `ng` and `dc` are of size 505x505, which is larger than necessary. They can be resized to the actual size of the input.

6. Inefficient calculations: The code calculates `ng[i][j] - ng[i][x - 1]` and `dc[b][i] - dc[t - 1][i]` in each iteration of the inner loops. These calculations can be avoided by precomputing partial sums.

Based on these observations, here is the proposed optimization strategy:

1. Remove unnecessary includes.
2. Replace macros with standard for-loops.
3. Combine the redundant checks into a single check.
4. Remove the redundant initialization of `ng` and `dc`.
5. Resize `ng` and `dc` to the actual size of the input.
6. Precompute partial sums to avoid redundant calculations.

Now, let's go through each optimization step in detail and update the code accordingly.
