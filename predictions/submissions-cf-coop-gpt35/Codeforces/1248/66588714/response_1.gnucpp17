### Code Analysis

Upon analyzing the given code, we can identify a few potential areas for optimization:

1. Unnecessary includes: The code includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header, which is not a standard C++ header. This header includes a large number of other headers, which can slow down compilation time and increase memory usage. We should only include the necessary headers for the specific functionality we need.

2. Slow input/output: The code uses `cin` and `cout` for input and output, respectively. These I/O functions are slower compared to other I/O functions like `scanf` and `printf`. We can use these faster functions to improve the overall performance.

3. Redundant variables: The variables `c` and `d` are not needed since we can directly calculate their values using `n - a` and `m - b`.

4. Lack of data type optimization: The code uses `long long` to store the input values. However, since the problem statement does not specify the size of the input, we can use a smaller data type like `int` to save memory.

### Optimization Strategy

Based on the analysis, we can formulate the following optimization strategy:

1. Replace the include statement `<bits/stdc++.h>` with the necessary headers for the required functionality.

2. Use `scanf` and `printf` instead of `cin` and `cout` for faster input/output.

3. Remove the redundant variables `c` and `d` and calculate their values directly.

4. Replace the `long long` data type with `int` for the input values.

### Step-by-Step Explanation

Let's optimize the code step by step:

1. Replace the include statement `<bits/stdc++.h>` with the necessary headers for the required functionality. In this case, we only need `<iostream>` for input/output.

2. Use `scanf` and `printf` instead of `cin` and `cout` for faster input/output. Modify the input and output statements accordingly.

3. Remove the redundant variables `c` and `d` and calculate their values directly using `n - a` and `m - b`.

4. Replace the `long long` data type with `int` for the input values.
