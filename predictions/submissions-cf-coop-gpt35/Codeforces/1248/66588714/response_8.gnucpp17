The code provided seems to calculate the number of odd and even numbers in two separate arrays and then calculates the product of odd and even numbers in each array and sums them up. The code is quite efficient in terms of memory usage as it only uses a few variables to store the counts of odd and even numbers. However, there are a few potential areas for optimization:

1. Unnecessary `#include` statement: The code includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header, which is not a standard C++ header and includes a large number of other headers. It is recommended to include only the necessary standard headers, such as `<iostream>` and `<vector>`, to avoid unnecessary overhead.

2. Unnecessary use of `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false)`: The code disables the synchronization between C and C++ standard streams, which is not necessary for this particular code. This can be removed without any impact on performance.

3. Unnecessary `cin.tie(NULL)` and `cout.tie(NULL)`: The code unties the cin and cout streams, which is not necessary for this particular code. This can be removed without any impact on performance.

4. Redundant variables: The variables `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are used to store the counts of odd and even numbers, but they are not necessary. We can calculate the products directly in the loop and sum them up using a single variable.

5. Loop optimization: The loops for reading the input and calculating the counts can be optimized by using pre-increment (`++i`) instead of post-increment (`i++`). This avoids the creation and assignment of a temporary variable.

6. Use of `long long` for `temp` variable: The `temp` variable is only used to read input values, which are assumed to be integers. Using `long long` for this variable is unnecessary and can be replaced with `int`.
