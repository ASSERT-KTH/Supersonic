The given code appears to be solving a scheduling problem. It takes input values `n` and `m` and a series of scheduling intervals. The goal is to assign each interval to a processor such that no two intervals overlap. The code then outputs the processor assigned to each interval.

To optimize this code, we can make the following improvements:

1. Remove Unused Code: The code includes several unnecessary preprocessor directives, such as `#define` statements for constants that are not used. We can remove these directives to simplify the code.

2. Use Efficient Data Structures: The current code uses a 2D vector to store the scheduling information. However, since the number of processors is fixed, we can use a simpler and more efficient data structure to store the information. We can create a vector of size `n+1` to represent the processors and assign each interval to the corresponding processor.

3. Avoid Sorting the Entire Vector: The code sorts the entire `a` vector, which is not necessary. We can optimize this step by using a partial sort or a priority queue to maintain the intervals in a sorted order.

4. Reduce Memory Usage: The current code uses `vector<ll>` to store the scheduling information, which consumes extra memory. We can optimize memory usage by using a struct or a pair to represent the intervals.

5. Optimize the Interval Assignment: The current code uses a loop to assign intervals to processors. We can improve this process by using a more efficient algorithm, such as the greedy algorithm, to assign intervals.

6. Remove Redundant Variables: The variable `i` is declared twice in the code. We can remove the second declaration to avoid confusion.

7. Remove Unused Constants: The constant `INF` is defined but not used in the code. We can remove this constant declaration.

Based on these optimizations, the optimized code is as follows:
