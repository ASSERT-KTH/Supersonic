Code Analysis:

1. The code includes unnecessary header files, such as `<bits/stdc++.h>`. It is best to include only the necessary header files to minimize compilation time and reduce unnecessary code.

2. The code defines several macros, such as `ll`, `pb`, `mp`, `pll`, `INF`, `PI`, `MOD`, `fir`, `sec`, `all`, and `mem`. These macros are not used in the code and can be removed to improve code readability.

3. The code uses a vector of vectors, `a`, to store input values. However, the size of the vector is fixed to `m + 1` rows and 4 columns, even though the actual size required may be smaller. This leads to inefficient memory usage.

4. The code uses an array, `sch`, to store the schedule of tasks. The size of the array is fixed to `n + 1`, even though the actual size required may be smaller. This leads to inefficient memory usage.

5. The code sorts the vector `a` based on the first column. However, the sorting algorithm used is not specified, and it is important to use an efficient sorting algorithm to minimize the running time.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Remove unnecessary header files to improve code readability and compilation time.

2. Remove unused macros to improve code readability.

3. Use a more efficient data structure to store the input values instead of a vector of vectors. A better option would be to use a vector of pairs, where each pair represents a single input value.

4. Use a more efficient data structure to store the schedule of tasks instead of an array. A better option would be to use a vector, where each element represents the schedule of a single task.

5. Use a more efficient sorting algorithm, such as `std::sort()`, to sort the input values based on the first column.

Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. Remove unnecessary header files, such as `<bits/stdc++.h>`. Update the code to include only the necessary header files, such as `<iostream>` and `<vector>`.

2. Remove unused macros, such as `ll`, `pb`, `mp`, `pll`, `INF`, `PI`, `MOD`, `fir`, `sec`, `all`, and `mem`.

3. Replace the vector of vectors, `a`, with a vector of pairs, where each pair represents a single input value. This will reduce the memory usage.

4. Replace the array, `sch`, with a vector, where each element represents the schedule of a single task. This will reduce the memory usage.

5. Use `std::sort()` to sort the vector `a` based on the first column. This will ensure that the input values are sorted efficiently.

Optimized Code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

int main() {
  std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  std::cin.tie(NULL);
  std::cout.tie(NULL);

  int n, m;
  std::cin >> n >> m;

  std::vector<std::pair<std::pair<int, int>, std::pair<int, int>>> a(m);

  for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
    std::cin >> a[i].first.second >> a[i].first.first >> a[i].second.first;
    a[i].second.second = i + 1;
  }

  std::sort(a.begin(), a.end());

  std::vector<int> sch(n + 1, 0);

  for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
    int cnt = a[i].second.first;
    for (int j = a[i].first.second; j < a[i].first.first; j++) {
      if (!sch[j]) {
        cnt--;
        sch[j] = a[i].second.second;
        if (!cnt) break;
      }
    }
    if (cnt) {
      std::cout << -1;
      return 0;
    }
  }

  for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++)
    std::cout << sch[i] << " ";

  return 0;
}
```

This optimized code:

1. Removes unnecessary header files and unused macros to improve code readability and compilation time.
2. Replaces the vector of vectors, `a`, with a vector of pairs, reducing memory usage.
3. Replaces the array, `sch`, with a vector, reducing memory usage.
4. Uses `std::sort()` to sort the input values efficiently.
5. Preserves the functionality and output of the original code.
