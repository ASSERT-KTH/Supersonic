The provided code seems to solve a scheduling problem. It takes input values `n` and `m`, where `n` represents the number of tasks and `m` represents the number of available time slots. The program then takes `m` lines of input, where each line contains three integers: the start time, end time, and the number of tasks that can be scheduled during that time slot. The code then assigns a task number to each time slot, ensuring that the number of tasks scheduled within each time slot is not more than the specified limit. Finally, it prints the assigned task numbers for each time slot.

To optimize this code, we will focus on the following areas:

1. Minimize memory usage by using more efficient data structures.
2. Improve the sorting operation for better performance.
3. Optimize the loop by reducing redundant computations.
4. Use compiler optimizations to improve performance.
