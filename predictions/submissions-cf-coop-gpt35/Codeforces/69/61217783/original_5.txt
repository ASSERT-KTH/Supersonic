Analysis:
The given code reads in a number `n` and then reads in `n` sets of three integers `x`, `y`, and `z`. It calculates the sum of `x`, `y`, and `z` separately. Finally, it checks if all three sums are zero and prints "YES" if true, and "NO" otherwise.

Potential optimizations:
1. Reduce I/O operations: The current implementation reads in `n` sets of three integers. Instead, we can read one set at a time and calculate the sums simultaneously. This will reduce the number of I/O operations and improve efficiency.
2. Use a single sum variable: Instead of having separate variables for `sum_x`, `sum_y`, and `sum_z`, we can use a single variable to calculate the sum of all three variables. This will reduce memory usage and simplify the code.
3. Early termination: As soon as we find any non-zero sum, we can terminate the loop and print "NO" without calculating the remaining sums. This will further improve efficiency.

Optimization steps:
1. Remove the `using namespace std;` line. It is considered a good practice to explicitly mention the namespace for each identifier to avoid potential naming conflicts.
2. Replace the `cin` statements inside the loop with a single `cin` statement that reads `x`, `y`, and `z` at once.
3. Replace the individual sum variables (`sum_x`, `sum_y`, `sum_z`) with a single sum variable (`total_sum`).
4. Initialize `total_sum` to zero before the loop.
5. Calculate the sum of `x`, `y`, and `z` inside the loop and add it to `total_sum`.
6. Check if `total_sum` is zero after the loop and print "YES" if true, and "NO" otherwise.
7. Add appropriate comments to the code to highlight the changes made and improve code readability.

Optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  int n;
  std::cin >> n;

  int total_sum = 0;

  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    int x, y, z;
    std::cin >> x >> y >> z;
    total_sum += (x + y + z);

    // Early termination if any sum is non-zero
    if (total_sum != 0) {
      std::cout << "NO";
      return 0;
    }
  }

  std::cout << "YES";
  return 0;
}
```

By implementing these optimization steps, we have reduced the number of I/O operations, minimized memory usage, and improved the overall efficiency of the code.
