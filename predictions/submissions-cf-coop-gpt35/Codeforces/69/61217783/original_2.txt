The given code reads an integer `n` from the user and then reads `n` sets of three integers (`x`, `y`, and `z`) from the user. It calculates the sum of `x`, `y`, and `z` for each set and checks if the sum of all sets is zero. Based on the result, it outputs "YES" or "NO".

Upon analyzing the code, we can identify a few potential areas for optimization:

1. Input/Output: The code uses `cin` and `cout` for input and output operations. These operations can be quite slow, especially when reading or writing large amounts of data. We can optimize this by using faster input/output functions.

2. Loop Optimization: The code uses a loop to iterate `n` times, performing addition operations on each iteration. We can optimize the loop by reducing the number of additions.

3. Redundant Check: The code checks if the sums of `x`, `y`, and `z` are zero after processing all sets. We can optimize this by checking the sums during the loop iteration itself and breaking the loop if any of the sums becomes non-zero.

Based on these observations, let's proceed with the optimization steps.
