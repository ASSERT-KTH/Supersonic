Code Analysis:

The given code reads an integer `n` from the user and then reads `n` sets of three integers `x`, `y`, and `z`. It calculates the sum of `x`, `y`, and `z` separately and checks if all three sums are zero. If they are, it prints "YES", otherwise it prints "NO".

Potential performance bottlenecks and inefficient memory usage in the given code:
1. The code uses separate variables `sum_x`, `sum_y`, and `sum_z` to store the sums of `x`, `y`, and `z` respectively. This can be inefficient if `n` is a large number, as it requires `n` additions and updates to these variables.

Optimization Strategy:

To optimize the given code, we can:
1. Use a single variable to store the sum of `x`, `y`, and `z`. This will reduce the number of additions and updates required to calculate the sum.
2. Eliminate the need for separate variables to store the sums of `x`, `y`, and `z`.

Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. Remove the separate variables `sum_x`, `sum_y`, and `sum_z`.
2. Initialize a single variable `sum` to 0 before the loop.
3. Inside the loop, directly add the values of `x`, `y`, and `z` to `sum`.
4. After the loop, check if `sum` is equal to 0 and print the corresponding output.

Optimized Code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  int sum = 0;
  
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    int x, y, z;
    cin >> x >> y >> z;
    sum += (x + y + z);
  }
  
  if (sum == 0) {
    cout << "YES";
  } else {
    cout << "NO";
  }
  
  return 0;
}
```

The optimized code reduces the number of additions and updates required to calculate the sum by using a single variable. This improves the efficiency of the code, especially when `n` is large.

Trade-offs: The optimized code introduces a slight increase in complexity due to the removal of separate variables and the use of a single variable. However, this trade-off is minimal compared to the performance gain achieved by reducing the number of additions and updates.
