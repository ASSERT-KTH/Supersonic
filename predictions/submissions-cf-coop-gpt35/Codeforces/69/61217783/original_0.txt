Code Analysis:
- The code reads an integer n from the user, followed by n sets of three integers x, y, and z.
- It calculates the sum of x, y, and z for each set.
- Finally, it checks if the sum of x, y, and z is zero for all sets and outputs "YES" if true, and "NO" otherwise.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Avoid unnecessary memory allocation: The variables sum_x, sum_y, and sum_z can be replaced with a single variable sum.
2. Reduce the number of input/output operations: Instead of reading n and each set of x, y, and z separately, we can read all the sets in a single loop.
3. Optimize the sum calculation: Instead of adding x, y, and z separately, we can add them directly to the sum variable.
4. Use early termination: If the sum of x, y, and z is non-zero for any set, we can immediately output "NO" and terminate the loop.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Replace sum_x, sum_y, and sum_z with a single variable sum.
   - Rationale: This reduces the memory usage by eliminating unnecessary variables.
   - Trade-off: None. This change simplifies the code without sacrificing performance.

2. Read all sets in a single loop.
   - Rationale: This reduces the number of input operations, improving efficiency.
   - Trade-off: None. This change does not introduce any complexity.

3. Optimize the sum calculation.
   - Rationale: By adding x, y, and z directly to the sum variable, we eliminate unnecessary intermediate additions.
   - Trade-off: None. This change simplifies the code and improves performance.

4. Use early termination.
   - Rationale: If the sum of x, y, and z is non-zero for any set, we can immediately output "NO" and terminate the loop, avoiding unnecessary iterations.
   - Trade-off: None. This change improves efficiency without introducing complexity.

Optimized Code:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  int sum = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    int x, y, z;
    cin >> x >> y >> z;
    sum += x + y + z;
    if (sum != 0) {
      cout << "NO";
      return 0;
    }
  }
  cout << "YES";
  return 0;
}
```
