Code Analysis:
- The code uses the `map` data structure to store the input values as keys and their indices as values.
- The code then iterates over the map to find the minimum difference between any two indices for values that appear more than once.
- If such a difference is found, it updates the `minres` variable with the minimum difference.
- Finally, it outputs the `minres` if it is not equal to `LLONG_MAX`, otherwise it outputs -1.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Use a `vector` instead of a `map` to store the input values and their corresponding indices. This eliminates the overhead of maintaining a balanced binary search tree in the map and improves the lookup time.
2. Sort the vector to bring the values that appear more than once closer together. This reduces the number of iterations needed to find the minimum difference.
3. Instead of iterating over the sorted vector, iterate over the adjacent pairs of values. This eliminates the need for indexing and improves cache locality.
4. Use a variable to track the minimum difference instead of updating `minres` inside the loop. This reduces the number of comparisons and assignments.
5. Change the type of `minres` to `int` instead of `ll` since the minimum difference will always be a positive integer.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Replace the `map<ll, vector<ll>>` with `vector<pair<ll, ll>>` to store the input values and their indices.
2. Sort the vector using the `sort` function from the `<algorithm>` header.
3. Initialize `minres` as `INT_MAX` instead of `LLONG_MAX`.
4. Iterate over the adjacent pairs of values in the sorted vector using a `for` loop and update `minres` if the difference between the indices is positive and smaller than the current `minres`.
5. After the loop, check if `minres` is still `INT_MAX` and output -1 if it is, otherwise output `minres`.

Optimized Code Block:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

void solve() {
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  vector<pair<int, int>> v(n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> v[i].first;
    v[i].second = i + 1;
  }
  sort(v.begin(), v.end());
  
  int minres = INT_MAX;
  for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
    if ((v[i].second - v[i - 1].second) > 0) {
      minres = min(minres, v[i].second - v[i - 1].second + 1);
    }
  }
  
  if (minres == INT_MAX) {
    cout << -1 << endl;
  } else {
    cout << minres << endl;
  }
}

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  int t;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    solve();
  }
  return 0;
}
```

The optimized code reduces the overhead of maintaining a map and improves the lookup time by using a sorted vector. It also eliminates unnecessary computations and reduces the memory usage by using an integer instead of a long long int for `minres`. These optimizations should result in significant performance improvements.
