There are several potential optimizations that can be made to improve the efficiency of the given code:

1. Avoid unnecessary includes: The code includes the entire `<bits/stdc++.h>` library, which is not recommended. It is better to include only the necessary headers.

2. Avoid using `using namespace std;`: This can lead to namespace collisions and make the code harder to read and understand. It is better to use the `std::` prefix when necessary.

3. Avoid using `typedef`: The `typedef` keyword is not necessary for the code and can be replaced with the `using` keyword for better readability.

4. Avoid using `map` for storing vector elements: The code uses a `map` to store vectors of elements. This can be inefficient in terms of memory usage and lookup time. Instead, we can use a `vector` of `pair` or a `vector` of custom structures to store the values.

5. Avoid unnecessary loop variables: The loop variable `i` in the `rep` macro is not used in the loop body. It can be eliminated to improve code readability.

6. Use `emplace_back` instead of `push_back`: When adding elements to a vector, it is more efficient to use `emplace_back` instead of `push_back`, as it avoids unnecessary copies or moves of the elements.

7. Avoid unnecessary checks in the inner loop: The inner loop checks if `(v[i] - v[i - 1]) > 0`, which is always true since `i` starts from 1. This check can be removed.

8. Avoid using `endl` for output: The `endl` manipulator flushes the output buffer, which can be expensive. It is better to use `'\n'` for newline characters.

9. Use `reserve` to preallocate memory: Preallocating memory for the vector can improve performance by reducing the number of reallocations.

Based on these optimizations, here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <limits>

struct Element {
    long long int value;
    std::vector<int> indices;
};

void solve() {
    long long int n;
    std::cin >> n;

    std::vector<Element> elements;
    elements.reserve(n);

    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        long long int val;
        std::cin >> val;

        auto it = std::find_if(elements.begin(), elements.end(), [&](const Element& e) {
            return e.value == val;
        });

        if (it == elements.end()) {
            elements.emplace_back(Element{val, {i + 1}});
        } else {
            it->indices.push_back(i + 1);
        }
    }

    long long int minres = std::numeric_limits<long long int>::max();

    for (const auto& element : elements) {
        const std::vector<int>& indices = element.indices;
        if (indices.size() > 1) {
            for (int i = 1; i < indices.size(); i++) {
                minres = std::min(minres, static_cast<long long int>(indices[i] - indices[i - 1] + 1));
            }
        }
    }

    if (minres == std::numeric_limits<long long int>::max()) {
        std::cout << -1 << '\n';
    } else {
        std::cout << minres << '\n';
    }
}

int main() {
    std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    std::cin.tie(NULL);

    int t;
    std::cin >> t;

    while (t--) {
        solve();
    }

    return 0;
}
```

These optimizations improve the efficiency of the code by reducing memory usage, eliminating unnecessary checks, and using more efficient data structures. The changes made are minimal and preserve the functionality and output of the original code.
