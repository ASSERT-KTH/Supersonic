Code Analysis:
- The code reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases.
- For each test case, the code reads an integer `n` from the input, followed by `n` integers.
- The code then builds a map `m` where the keys are the integers from the input and the values are vectors containing the positions of those integers in the input.
- The code iterates over each key-value pair in the map and checks if the corresponding vector has more than one element.
- If a vector has more than one element, the code iterates over the elements of the vector and calculates the difference between consecutive elements, keeping track of the minimum difference.
- Finally, the code prints the minimum difference found or -1 if no minimum difference was found.

Potential optimizations:
1. Unnecessary includes: The code includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header, which includes many standard library headers. This can result in slower compilation times and increased memory usage. It is better to include only the necessary headers.
2. Use `const` references: The code passes the vector `v` by value in the inner loop, which can result in unnecessary copying. It is better to pass it by const reference to avoid the overhead of copying.
3. Avoid unnecessary calculations: The code calculates `v.size()` in each iteration of the inner loop, which can be avoided by storing the size in a variable before the loop.
4. Avoid unnecessary comparisons: The code compares `(v[i] - v[i - 1]) > 0` in each iteration of the inner loop, which is redundant. The difference will always be greater than 0 since the positions are in increasing order. This comparison can be removed.
5. Avoid using `endl`: The code uses `endl` to output a new line, which flushes the output stream in addition to inserting a new line. This can result in slower output. It is better to use `'\n'` instead.
6. Use `reserve` for map values: The code does not know the size of the vectors when inserting them into the map. By using the `reserve` function, we can allocate memory for the vectors in advance, reducing the number of reallocations and improving performance.
7. Use `emplace` instead of `push_back`: The code uses `push_back` to insert elements into the vectors in the map. By using `emplace_back` or `emplace` instead, we can construct the elements in place, avoiding unnecessary copies or moves.

Optimization steps:
1. Remove unnecessary includes and replace `endl` with `'\n'`:
   - Remove the line `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`.
   - Replace `endl` with `'\n'` in the code.

2. Pass the vector `v` by const reference in the inner loop:
   - Change the loop declaration from `for (int i = 1; i < v.size(); i++)` to `for (int i = 1; i < v.size(); i++) const`.

3. Store the size of the vector `v` in a variable before the inner loop:
   - Add the line `int size = v.size();` before the inner loop.
   - Change the loop condition from `i < v.size()` to `i < size`.

4. Remove the unnecessary comparison `(v[i] - v[i - 1]) > 0` in the inner loop.

5. Use `'\n'` instead of `endl` in the output statements.

6. Use `reserve` to allocate memory for the vectors in the map:
   - Before the loop that reads the integers from the input, add the line `m.reserve(n);`.

7. Use `emplace_back` instead of `push_back` to insert elements into the vectors in the map:
   - Change `m[val].push_back(i + 1);` to `m[val].emplace_back(i + 1);`.

Optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <map>

typedef long long int ll;

void solve() {
  ll n;
  std::cin >> n;
  std::map<ll, std::vector<ll>> m;
  m.reserve(n);
  for (ll i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    ll val;
    std::cin >> val;
    m[val].emplace_back(i + 1);
  }
  ll minres = LLONG_MAX;
  for (const auto& x : m) {
    const std::vector<ll>& v = x.second;
    if (v.size() > 1) {
      int size = v.size();
      for (int i = 1; i < size; i++) {
        minres = std::min(minres, v[i] - v[i - 1] + 1);
      }
    }
  }
  if (minres == LLONG_MAX) {
    std::cout << -1 << '\n';
  } else {
    std::cout << minres << '\n';
  }
}

int main() {
  std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  std::cin.tie(NULL);
  int t;
  std::cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    solve();
  }
}
```

The optimized code minimizes unnecessary operations and memory usage, resulting in improved performance. The changes made are minimal and focused on areas that have the potential to impact performance.
