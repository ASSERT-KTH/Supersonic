This code is solving a problem where we are given an array of integers and we need to find the minimum distance between any two equal elements. The code reads the input, stores the indices of each element in a map, and then iterates over the map to find the minimum distance.

Let's analyze the code and identify potential areas for optimization:

1. The `map<ll, vector<ll>> m` data structure is used to store the indices of each element. However, using a map introduces an overhead of O(log n) for each insertion and lookup operation. Since we only need the indices in the order they appear in the input, we can use a vector instead.

2. The current implementation checks if the size of the vector `v` is greater than 1, and if so, iterates over it to find the minimum distance. However, we can optimize this by checking if the size is greater than or equal to 2, as we need at least two indices to compute the distance.

3. The `minres` variable is initially set to `LLONG_MAX`, which is the maximum value for a `long long int`. However, we can set it to a higher value, such as `n + 1`, to avoid unnecessary comparisons.

4. The `endl` constant is used to insert a newline character and flush the output stream. However, this can be replaced with a simple newline character `'\n'`, which is faster.

Now let's outline the optimization strategy and explain each step:

1. Replace the `map<ll, vector<ll>> m` with a `vector<vector<ll>> m(n)` to store the indices of each element.

2. Instead of pushing the indices into the vector using `m[val].push_back(i + 1)`, directly store them using `m[val].emplace_back(i + 1)`.

3. Change the condition `if (v.size() > 1)` to `if (v.size() >= 2)`.

4. Initialize `minres` with a higher value, such as `n + 1`, instead of `LLONG_MAX`.

5. Replace `endl` with `'\n'`.

Here's the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

typedef long long int ll;

void solve() {
  ll n;
  cin >> n;
  vector<vector<ll>> m(n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    ll val;
    cin >> val;
    m[val].emplace_back(i + 1);
  }
  ll minres = n + 1;
  for (auto x : m) {
    vector<ll> v = x;
    if (v.size() >= 2) {
      for (int i = 1; i < v.size(); i++) {
        if ((v[i] - v[i - 1]) > 0) {
          minres = min(minres, v[i] - v[i - 1] + 1);
        }
      }
    }
  }
  if (minres == n + 1) {
    cout << -1 << '\n';
  } else {
    cout << minres << '\n';
  }
}

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  int t;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    solve();
  }
}
```

The optimized code reduces the memory overhead by using a vector instead of a map, improves the conditional check for finding the minimum distance, and uses a higher initial value for `minres`. These changes result in improved performance and reduced memory usage.
