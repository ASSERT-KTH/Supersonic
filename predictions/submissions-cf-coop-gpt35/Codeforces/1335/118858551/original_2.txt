Code Analysis:
- The code reads an integer `t` as input, which represents the number of test cases.
- For each test case, the code reads an integer `n`, followed by `n` integers into a vector `v`.
- The code then inserts the elements of `v` into a set `s` to remove duplicates.
- The code also counts the frequency of each element in `v` using a map `m`.
- The code finds the maximum frequency `M` among all elements in `m`.
- Finally, the code prints the number of elements to be removed from `v` to make all elements in the vector distinct.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Avoid unnecessary includes and using namespace std:
   - The code includes a large header file `bits/stdc++.h`, which is not required for this program.
   - Instead of using the entire `std` namespace, only the required functions and objects should be used to avoid potential name conflicts and improve compile times.

2. Optimize input/output operations:
   - The code uses `cin` and `cout` for input/output operations, which are slower compared to other methods like `scanf` and `printf`.
   - Replacing `cin` and `cout` with `scanf` and `printf` respectively can improve the performance of the program.

3. Optimize data structures:
   - The code uses a vector `v` to store the input elements and a set `s` to remove duplicates.
   - Instead of using a vector and a set, a single unordered_set can be used to store the unique elements of `v` and count their frequency.
   - This will reduce the memory usage and improve the efficiency of the program.

4. Optimize the loop for counting the frequencies:
   - The code uses a range-based for loop to iterate over the elements of `v` and insert them into the set `s` and map `m`.
   - This loop can be optimized by using a regular for loop with an index variable to directly access each element of `v`.
   - This will eliminate the need for creating iterators and improve the performance.

5. Optimize the loop for finding the maximum frequency:
   - The code uses a range-based for loop to iterate over the elements of `m` and find the maximum frequency.
   - This loop can be optimized by keeping track of the maximum frequency while counting the frequencies in the previous step.
   - This will avoid an additional loop and improve the efficiency of the program.

6. Optimize the conditions for printing the output:
   - The code uses multiple conditions to determine the output based on the size of the set `s` and the maximum frequency `M`.
   - These conditions can be simplified to reduce the number of comparisons and improve the performance.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Optimize includes and using namespace std:
   - Remove the unnecessary `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` from the code.
   - Replace `using namespace std;` with specific using statements for the required functions and objects.

2. Optimize input/output operations:
   - Replace `cin` and `cout` with `scanf` and `printf` respectively for input/output operations.
   - Use `%d` format specifier for reading integers and printing integers.

3. Optimize data structures:
   - Replace the vector `v` and set `s` with a single unordered_set `s` to store the unique elements of `v`.
   - Remove the map `m` as it is not required.

4. Optimize the loop for counting the frequencies:
   - Replace the range-based for loop with a regular for loop to directly access each element of `v`.
   - Use the index variable to insert the elements into the unordered_set `s` and increment the frequency count.

5. Optimize the loop for finding the maximum frequency:
   - Keep track of the maximum frequency `M` while counting the frequencies in the previous step.
   - Update `M` whenever a higher frequency is encountered.

6. Optimize the conditions for printing the output:
   - Simplify the conditions for printing the output based on the size of the set `s` and the maximum frequency `M`.
   - Use a single condition to check if `s.size()` is greater than `M`, and print `M` if true.
   - Use a single condition to check if `s.size()` is equal to `M`, and print `M - 1` if true.
   - Print `s.size()` if none of the above conditions are true.

Optimized Code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_set>
using std::cin;
using std::cout;
using std::endl;
using std::unordered_set;

int main() {
  int t;
  scanf("%d", &t);
  while (t--) {
    int n;
    scanf("%d", &n);
    unordered_set<int> s;
    int M = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      int x;
      scanf("%d", &x);
      s.insert(x);
      M = std::max(M, (int)s.count(x));
    }
    if (n >= 2 && s.size() == n) {
      printf("1\n");
    } else if (s.size() > M) {
      printf("%d\n", M);
    } else {
      printf("%d\n", (int)s.size());
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```
