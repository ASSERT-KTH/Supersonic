The given code is a C++ program that reads an integer `t` from the input, followed by `t` test cases. Each test case consists of an integer `n`, followed by `n` integers. The program then performs some calculations based on the input and outputs the result for each test case.

Upon analyzing the code, we can identify a few potential areas for optimization:

1. Redundant data structures: The code uses both a `set` and a `map` to store the unique elements of the input array and their frequencies. However, this is inefficient because the `map` already provides a way to count the frequencies of elements. We can eliminate the use of the `set` and use only the `map` to achieve the same result.

2. Unnecessary loop: The code iterates over the input array twice - once to insert the elements into the `set`, and again to insert them into the `map`. This can be optimized by combining these two steps into a single loop.

3. Unnecessary memory clearing: The code clears the `set` and `map` at the end of each test case. Since these data structures are re-initialized in each iteration, clearing them is unnecessary.

4. Unoptimized loop for finding the maximum frequency: The code uses a loop to find the maximum frequency in the `map`. This can be optimized by using the `max_element` function from the `<algorithm>` header.

Based on these observations, we can propose the following optimization strategy:

1. Replace the `set` with the `map` to store the unique elements and their frequencies.
2. Combine the two loops that insert elements into the `map` into a single loop.
3. Remove the unnecessary memory clearing statements.
4. Replace the loop for finding the maximum frequency with the `max_element` function.

Let's now proceed with the step-by-step explanation of the optimizations and provide the optimized code.
