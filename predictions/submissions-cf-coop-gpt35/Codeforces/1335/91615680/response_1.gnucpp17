The provided code aims to find the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from an array in order to make the count of all remaining elements equal. However, there are several areas in the code that can be optimized for better performance:

1. Inefficient Data Structure: The code uses a simple array to store the count of each element. This can be improved by using a more efficient data structure, such as a hash table or a map, to store the element-count pairs. This will reduce the memory usage and also improve the lookup time for each element.

2. Redundant Computations: The code iterates over the entire array to find the maximum count and also counts the number of elements that have a count greater than zero. This can be optimized by keeping track of the maximum count and the number of non-zero counts while reading the input array. This will eliminate the need for a separate loop at the end.

3. Compiler Optimizations: We can make use of compiler optimizations to further improve the performance. For example, we can use the `-O3` optimization flag to enable aggressive optimizations. Additionally, we can use the `__builtin_expect` intrinsic to provide a hint to the compiler about the expected branch outcome, which can help in optimizing the code.
