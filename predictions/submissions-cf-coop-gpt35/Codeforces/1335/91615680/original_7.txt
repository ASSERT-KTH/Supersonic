Analysis:
- The code reads an integer `t` as the number of test cases.
- For each test case, the code reads an integer `n` as the number of elements in an array and then reads `n` integers into the array.
- The code initializes an array `arr` of size 200001 with all elements set to 0.
- The code counts the frequency of each number in the array by incrementing the corresponding element in `arr`.
- The code then finds the maximum frequency `maks` and the number of elements with non-zero frequency `temp`.
- If `temp` is equal to `maks`, it decrements `maks` by 1.
- Finally, the code prints the minimum of `temp` and `maks`.

Potential optimizations:
1. The use of the `std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false)` function can improve the speed of input/output operations by disabling the synchronization between C and C++ standard streams.
2. The use of `cin` and `cout` for input/output can be slower than using `scanf` and `printf` functions. Replacing `cin` and `cout` with `scanf` and `printf` can improve performance.
3. The array `arr` has a fixed size of 200001, which may lead to inefficient memory usage if the actual number of elements is much smaller. Using a dynamic data structure, such as `std::unordered_map`, can save memory if the array size is significantly larger than the number of unique elements.
4. The loop `for (int x : arr)` iterates over the entire `arr` array, including elements with zero frequency. This loop can be optimized to iterate only over elements with non-zero frequency.
5. The use of `std::min` function to find the minimum of `temp` and `maks` can be replaced with a simple conditional statement for better performance.

Optimization strategy:
1. Replace `using namespace std;` with explicit `std` namespace usage to avoid potential conflicts and improve code readability.
2. Add `std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);` before the `main` function to improve input/output performance.
3. Replace `cin` and `cout` with `scanf` and `printf` respectively for input/output operations.
4. Replace the fixed-size array `arr` with a `std::unordered_map` to save memory.
5. Change the loop `for (int x : arr)` to iterate only over elements with non-zero frequency.
6. Replace the use of `std::min` function with a conditional statement.

Optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>

int main() {
  std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);

  int t, n, x;
  std::scanf("%d", &t);
  while (t--) {
    std::unordered_map<int, int> frequency;
    std::scanf("%d", &n);
    while (n--) {
      std::scanf("%d", &x);
      frequency[x]++;
    }
    int maks = 0, temp = 0;
    for (const auto& pair : frequency) {
      if (pair.second) {
        temp++;
        if (pair.second > maks)
          maks = pair.second;
      }
    }
    if (temp == maks) {
      maks--;
    }
    std::printf("%d\n", (temp < maks) ? temp : maks);
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Explanation:
1. Replacing `using namespace std;` with explicit `std` namespace usage is a good practice to avoid potential naming conflicts and improve code readability.
2. Adding `std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);` before the `main` function disables the synchronization between C and C++ standard streams, which can improve input/output performance.
3. Replacing `cin >> t` with `std::scanf("%d", &t)` and `cout << min(temp, maks) << endl` with `std::printf("%d\n", (temp < maks) ? temp : maks)` improves input/output performance by using `scanf` and `printf` functions instead of `cin` and `cout`.
4. Replacing the fixed-size array `arr` with a `std::unordered_map` saves memory by dynamically allocating memory only for elements with non-zero frequency.
5. Changing the loop `for (int x : arr)` to `for (const auto& pair : frequency)` allows iterating over elements with non-zero frequency in the `std::unordered_map` `frequency`.
6. Replacing the use of `std::min` function with a conditional statement simplifies the code and improves performance by avoiding function call overhead.

Trade-offs:
- The use of `std::unordered_map` instead of a fixed-size array introduces additional overhead due to dynamic memory allocation and hash table operations. However, this trade-off is acceptable considering the potential memory savings and improved performance for cases where the actual number of elements is much smaller than the fixed array size.
- The use of `scanf` and `printf` functions instead of `cin` and `cout` can lead to less readable code due to the format specifiers and lack of type safety. However, the performance improvement justifies this trade-off in performance-sensitive applications.
