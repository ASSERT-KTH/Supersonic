The given code seems to solve a problem that involves processing a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n`, followed by `n` integers. It counts the frequency of each integer and then determines the maximum frequency and the number of integers that have a non-zero frequency. Finally, it prints the minimum of these two values.

Upon analyzing the code, we can identify a few potential areas for optimization:

1. Inefficient Data Structure: The code uses an array `arr` of size 200001 to store the frequency of each integer. This array is initialized to 0 for each test case, even though the maximum value of `n` is not known in advance. This results in unnecessary memory allocation and initialization.

2. Redundant Computations: The code iterates over the entire `arr` array to count the number of non-zero frequency integers and find the maximum frequency. However, we can avoid this iteration by maintaining separate variables to track these values while updating the frequency array.

3. Compiler Optimizations: We can explore compiler-specific optimizations and pragmas to hint the compiler to optimize certain parts of the code. This can potentially result in more efficient code generation.

Let's proceed with the optimization strategy step by step.
