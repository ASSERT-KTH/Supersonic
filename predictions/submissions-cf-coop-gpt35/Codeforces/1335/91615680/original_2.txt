The given code reads an integer `t` as the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` followed by `n` integers. It counts the frequency of each integer and finds the maximum frequency and the number of distinct integers with non-zero frequency. It then prints the minimum of these two values.

To optimize this code, we can make the following changes:

1. Avoid using `using namespace std;`: While it may seem convenient, it is considered bad practice to include the entire `std` namespace. Instead, explicitly use `std::` before standard library objects and functions.

2. Use a more efficient data structure: The code currently uses an array of size `200001` to store the frequency of each integer. However, the range of integers is not specified, so it is not necessary to allocate such a large array. We can use a `std::unordered_map` to store the frequency of each integer. This will reduce memory usage and improve performance.

3. Remove unnecessary variables: The variables `temp` and `maks` are used to compute the minimum value, but they are not needed. We can directly compare the number of distinct integers with non-zero frequency and the maximum frequency without using these variables.

4. Optimize the loop: The range-based for loop `for (int x : arr)` iterates over the entire array, including elements with zero frequency. We can optimize this loop by using a regular for loop and iterating from `1` to `n` instead of `0` to `n-1`. This will skip elements with zero frequency and improve performance.

With these optimizations in mind, here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>

int main() {
  int t;
  std::cin >> t;

  while (t--) {
    int n;
    std::cin >> n;

    std::unordered_map<int, int> freq;

    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
      int x;
      std::cin >> x;
      freq[x]++;
    }

    int maxFreq = 0;
    int distinctCount = 0;

    for (const auto& pair : freq) {
      maxFreq = std::max(maxFreq, pair.second);
      if (pair.second > 0) {
        distinctCount++;
      }
    }

    if (distinctCount == maxFreq) {
      maxFreq--;
    }

    std::cout << std::min(distinctCount, maxFreq) << std::endl;
  }

  return 0;
}
```

These optimizations improve the performance and memory usage of the original code without changing the functionality or output. The code is now more efficient and easier to understand.
