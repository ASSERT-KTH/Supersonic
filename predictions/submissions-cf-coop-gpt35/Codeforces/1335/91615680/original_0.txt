The given code reads a number `t` and then performs the following steps `t` times:
1. Reads a number `n`.
2. Reads `n` integers and stores their frequencies in an array `arr`.
3. Finds the maximum frequency `maks` and the total number of non-zero frequencies `temp` in `arr`.
4. Prints the minimum of `temp` and `maks`.

While the code works correctly, there are several potential areas for optimization:

1. Inefficient memory usage: The array `arr` is declared and initialized with a size of 200001 for each test case. This is unnecessary and consumes a large amount of memory. We can optimize this by dynamically allocating memory for `arr` based on the maximum value of `x` read in each test case.

2. Redundant computations: The loop that finds the maximum frequency can be optimized. Instead of iterating over the entire `arr`, we can keep track of the maximum frequency while reading the numbers, eliminating the need for a separate loop.

3. Unnecessary comparison: The condition `if (temp == maks)` is unnecessary. If `temp` is equal to `maks`, we can simply decrement `maks` by 1 without checking the condition.

4. Compiler optimizations: We can suggest some compiler optimizations or pragma directives to hint the compiler to optimize certain parts of the code. This may include loop unrolling or enabling compiler optimizations like `-O2` or `-O3`.

Now, let's optimize the code step by step.
