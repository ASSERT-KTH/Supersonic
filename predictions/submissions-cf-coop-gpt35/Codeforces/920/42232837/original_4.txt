The given code appears to be a program that calculates the k-th number greater than x, which has exactly p distinct prime factors. The program uses a sieve to generate a list of prime numbers up to a certain limit, and then uses this list to factorize the given number p. It then calculates the number of values between x+1 and a certain limit that have exactly p distinct prime factors using the solve function.

Upon analyzing the code, the following potential areas of optimization can be identified:

1. Use a more efficient prime sieve algorithm: The current sieve implementation checks all numbers up to maxn for primality, which is not efficient. A more efficient algorithm, such as the Sieve of Eratosthenes or the segmented sieve, should be used.

2. Improve factorization algorithm: The current factorization algorithm iterates over all prime numbers up to sqrt(x) and checks if they divide x. This can be optimized by using a more efficient factorization algorithm, such as Pollard's rho algorithm or the quadratic sieve.

3. Optimize the solve function: The solve function iterates over all possible combinations of the prime factors of x. This can be optimized by using a more efficient algorithm, such as the inclusion-exclusion principle, to calculate the number of values between x+1 and a certain limit that have exactly p distinct prime factors.

4. Avoid unnecessary memory usage: The code currently uses a vector to store the list of prime numbers and factors. This can be optimized by using arrays or bitsets instead, which would reduce memory usage.

Based on these observations, the following optimization steps can be proposed:

1. Replace the current prime sieve implementation with a more efficient algorithm, such as the Sieve of Eratosthenes.

2. Replace the current factorization algorithm with a more efficient algorithm, such as Pollard's rho algorithm or the quadratic sieve.

3. Optimize the solve function by using a more efficient algorithm, such as the inclusion-exclusion principle.

4. Replace the vector data structure with arrays or bitsets to reduce memory usage.

Now, let's implement these optimization steps and provide the optimized code.
