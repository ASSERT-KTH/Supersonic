The given code is a C++ program that aims to solve a problem using number theory and prime factorization. However, the code can be optimized for better performance and memory usage. 

Let's analyze the code to identify potential areas for optimization:

1. The code uses a vector `pint` to store prime numbers. However, this vector is not required for the solution and can be eliminated.

2. The `fac` function calculates the prime factors of a given number `x` and stores them in the vector `f`. However, the vector `f` is cleared at the beginning of each function call, which is unnecessary. We can initialize `f` once outside the function and clear it only when needed.

3. The `solve` function calculates the number of integers in the range [1, `val`] that are not divisible by any of the prime factors in `f`. This calculation can be optimized by using the principle of inclusion-exclusion. Instead of iterating over all possible subsets of `f`, we can iterate over all numbers less than `lim` (where `lim` is the number of subsets of `f`) and calculate the product of prime factors corresponding to the set bits of the current number. By counting the number of set bits, we can determine whether to add or subtract the value of `val / tp` from the result.

4. The main loop in the `main` function reads inputs and calls the `solve` function multiple times. We can avoid repeatedly calculating the prime factors for the same value of `p` by calculating them once and storing them in a map or unordered_map.

Based on these observations, here is the optimization strategy:

1. Remove the unnecessary vector `pint`.

2. Initialize the vector `f` outside the `fac` function and clear it only when needed.

3. Rewrite the `solve` function to use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to calculate the result.

4. Use a map or unordered_map to store the prime factors for each value of `p` to avoid redundant calculations.

Let's now apply these optimizations step by step:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
const int maxn = 1.8e7;
bool pr[maxn + 100];
vector<long long> f;
unordered_map<int, vector<int>> prime_factors;

void fac(int x) {
  f.clear();
  for (auto i : prime_factors[x]) {
    if (i * i > x)
      break;
    f.push_back(i);
    while (x % i == 0)
      x /= i;
  }
  if (x != 1)
    f.push_back(x);
}

int solve(int val) {
  int ret = 0;
  int lim = 1 << f.size();
  for (int j = 1; j < lim; j++) {
    int tp = 1, ct = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < (int)f.size(); i++) {
      if ((j >> i) & 1) {
        tp *= f[i];
        ct++;
      }
    }
    ret += (ct % 2 ? 1 : -1) * val / tp;
  }
  return val - ret;
}

int main() {
  memset(pr, true, sizeof(pr));
  pr[0] = pr[1] = false;
  for (int i = 2; i <= maxn; i++)
    if (pr[i])
      for (int j = 2; j * i <= maxn; j++)
        pr[i * j] = false;

  for (int i = 2; i <= maxn; i++)
    if (pr[i]) {
      for (int j = i; j <= maxn; j += i)
        prime_factors[j].push_back(i);
    }

  int cas, x, p, k;
  cin >> cas;
  while (cas--) {
    scanf("%d%d%d", &x, &p, &k);
    fac(p);
    int a1 = solve(x), L = x + 1, R = maxn, ans = 0;
    while (L <= R) {
      int mid = (L + R) / 2;
      int val = solve(mid) - a1;
      if (val >= k)
        R = mid - 1, ans = mid;
      else
        L = mid + 1;
    }
    printf("%d\n", ans);
  }
  return 0;
}
```

In this optimized code:

1. The vector `pint` has been removed.

2. The vector `f` is initialized outside the `fac` function and cleared only when needed.

3. The `solve` function has been rewritten to use the principle of inclusion-exclusion.

4. The prime factors for each value of `p` are calculated once and stored in the `prime_factors` map.

These optimizations should improve the performance and memory usage of the code.
