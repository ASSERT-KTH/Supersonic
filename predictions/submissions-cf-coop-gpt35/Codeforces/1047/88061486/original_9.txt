Code Analysis:
1. The code calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all elements in the array 'a'.
2. It then divides each element of 'a' by the GCD and counts the frequency of each resulting value.
3. The code then iterates over all numbers from 2 to the maximum value in the frequency array and counts the maximum frequency of any number that is a divisor of the current number.
4. Finally, it prints the number of elements in 'a' minus the maximum frequency as the output.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Optimizing the GCD calculation:
   - The current GCD calculation is recursive, which can be inefficient for large inputs.
   - We can use the built-in `__gcd()` function from the `<algorithm>` library instead of the recursive `Gcd()` function.

2. Using a more efficient data structure for counting frequencies:
   - The current code uses an array `num[]` to count the frequency of each value.
   - We can use a `std::unordered_map<int, int>` to count the frequencies instead.
   - This will reduce the memory usage by only storing the frequencies of non-zero values.

3. Optimizing the loop over divisors:
   - The current code checks if a number `i` is prime by checking if `vis[i]` is zero.
   - Instead of checking for primality, we can directly iterate over divisors of `i`.
   - This will eliminate the need for the `vis[]` array and reduce the number of iterations.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Optimization 1 - GCD calculation:
   - Replace the `Gcd()` function with the `__gcd()` function from the `<algorithm>` library.
   - The `__gcd()` function is more efficient and avoids recursion.

2. Optimization 2 - Using `std::unordered_map` for counting frequencies:
   - Replace the `num[]` array with an `std::unordered_map<int, int>` called `frequency`.
   - Iterate over all elements in the array 'a' and update the frequency map accordingly.

3. Optimization 3 - Optimizing the loop over divisors:
   - Replace the loop over `i` from 2 to `maxx` with a loop over all divisors of `i`.
   - For each divisor `d` of `i`, update the frequency count `t` by adding the frequency of `d` from the frequency map.
   - Update the maximum frequency `cnt` accordingly.

Optimized Code:
```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <cmath>
#include <cstdio>
#include <cstring>
#include <ctime>
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>
#include <stack>
#include <unordered_map>
#define LL long long
#define maxn 300010
#define M 15000010
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int n;
  scanf("%d", &n);
  
  int a[maxn];
  for (register int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    scanf("%d", &a[i]);
  }

  // Optimization 1 - GCD calculation
  int g = __gcd(a[0], a[1]);
  for (register int i = 2; i < n; i++) {
    g = __gcd(g, a[i]);
  }

  // Optimization 2 - Using std::unordered_map for counting frequencies
  unordered_map<int, int> frequency;
  for (register int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    int t = a[i] / g;
    frequency[t]++;
  }

  int maxx = 0, cnt = 0;
  for (auto it = frequency.begin(); it != frequency.end(); ++it) {
    int t = 0;
    for (int j = it->first; j <= maxx; j += it->first) {
      t += frequency[j];
    }
    if (t > cnt) {
      cnt = t;
    }
  }

  if (cnt == 0) {
    printf("-1\n");
  } else {
    printf("%d\n", n - cnt);
  }

  return 0;
}
```

This optimized code eliminates the recursive GCD calculation, uses an unordered map for efficient frequency counting, and optimizes the loop over divisors. These optimizations improve the performance of the code by reducing redundant computations and optimizing data structures.
