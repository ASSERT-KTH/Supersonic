The provided code calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of an array of integers and then counts the number of integers that are divisible by each factor of the GCD. It then outputs the difference between the total count and the count of the most common factor.

To optimize this code, we can focus on the following areas:

1. Avoid unnecessary function calls: The code calls the `Gcd` function for each pair of elements in the array. This results in redundant calculations since the GCD of all elements can be calculated in a single pass. We can optimize this by calculating the GCD in a single loop.

2. Improve data structure efficiency: The code uses two arrays, `num` and `vis`, to store counts and flags respectively. Both arrays have a size of `M`, which is unnecessarily large. We can optimize this by resizing the arrays to a more appropriate size based on the maximum possible value of `maxx`.

3. Optimize the counting loop: The loop that counts the number of integers divisible by each factor can be optimized by only considering factors that are not already marked as visited. Additionally, we can use a variable to track the maximum count instead of repeatedly comparing values.

4. Use compiler optimizations: We can suggest the use of compiler optimizations, such as loop unrolling and optimization flags, to assist in optimizing the code.

Now, let's optimize the code step by step.
