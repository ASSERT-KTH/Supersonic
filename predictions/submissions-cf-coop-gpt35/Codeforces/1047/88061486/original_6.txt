The given code calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of an array of integers and then counts the frequency of each number divided by the GCD. It then finds the highest frequency and subtracts it from the total count to get the final result.

To optimize this code, we can focus on the following areas:

1. Avoid unnecessary calculations of GCD.
2. Optimize the frequency counting process.
3. Improve the loop for finding the highest frequency.

Let's go step by step to optimize the code.

### Step 1: Avoid unnecessary calculations of GCD

In the original code, the GCD is calculated for each pair of numbers in the array. However, we can optimize this by calculating the GCD of the entire array at once using the `std::gcd` function from the `<numeric>` header. This will reduce the number of function calls and improve performance.

### Step 2: Optimize the frequency counting process

The original code uses an array `num` to count the frequencies of numbers divided by the GCD. However, this approach requires a large amount of memory since the array size is based on the maximum value of the numbers divided by the GCD. 

To optimize this, we can use a `std::map` instead of an array to store the frequencies. This will dynamically allocate memory only for the numbers that are present in the array, resulting in better memory usage.

### Step 3: Improve the loop for finding the highest frequency

The original code uses a loop to iterate through the numbers in the range [2, maxx] and checks if each number is a prime or not using the `vis` array. This approach is not efficient and can be optimized.

To optimize this, we can use the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to find all prime numbers up to `maxx`. Then, we can iterate through the prime numbers and count their frequencies. This will reduce the number of iterations and improve performance.

Now, let's implement these optimizations in the code.

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <cmath>
#include <cstdio>
#include <cstring>
#include <ctime>
#include <iostream>
#include <map>
#include <numeric>
#include <queue>
#include <stack>

#define LL long long
#define maxn 300010
#define M 15000010

using namespace std;

int main() {
  int n;
  scanf("%d", &n);
  
  // Step 1: Calculate the GCD of the entire array
  int g;
  for (register int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    scanf("%d", &a[i]);
  }
  g = std::gcd(a[0], a[1]);
  for (register int i = 2; i < n; i++) {
    g = std::gcd(g, a[i]);
  }
  
  // Step 2: Optimize the frequency counting process
  map<int, int> num;
  int maxx = 0;
  for (register int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    int t = a[i] / g;
    num[t]++;
    if (t > maxx) {
      maxx = t;
    }
  }
  
  // Step 3: Improve the loop for finding the highest frequency
  int cnt = 0;
  int t = 0;
  
  // Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to find prime numbers up to maxx
  vector<bool> isPrime(maxx + 1, true);
  for (int p = 2; p * p <= maxx; p++) {
    if (isPrime[p]) {
      for (int i = p * p; i <= maxx; i += p) {
        isPrime[i] = false;
      }
    }
  }
  
  // Count frequencies of prime numbers
  for (register int i = 2; i <= maxx; i++) {
    if (isPrime[i]) {
      t = 0;
      for (register int j = i; j <= maxx; j += i) {
        t += num[j];
      }
      if (t > cnt) {
        cnt = t;
      }
    }
  }
  
  if (cnt == 0) {
    printf("-1\n");
  } else {
    printf("%d\n", n - cnt);
  }
  return 0;
}
```

These optimizations will improve the performance and reduce the memory usage of the original code while preserving its functionality and output.
