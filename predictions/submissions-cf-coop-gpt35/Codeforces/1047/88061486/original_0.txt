Analysis:
1. The code uses a recursive function `Gcd` to calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers. This function can be optimized to use the Euclidean algorithm, which has a time complexity of O(log(min(a,b))) instead of O(max(a,b)).
2. The code uses an array `num` to store the frequency of each element divided by the GCD. This array has a size of M (15000010), which is much larger than necessary for the given problem constraints. This can be optimized by using a dynamic data structure such as a map or unordered_map to store only the non-zero frequencies.
3. The code uses an array `vis` to mark the elements that have been visited in the loop. This array has the same size as `num` (M), which is unnecessary. It can be optimized by using a smaller array or a bitset to mark the visited elements.
4. The code calculates the maximum value of `t` in the first loop to determine the maximum index in the `num` array. This can be optimized by keeping track of the maximum value during the loop instead of using a separate variable.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Replace the recursive function `Gcd` with the Euclidean algorithm to improve efficiency.
2. Replace the array `num` with a dynamic data structure (e.g., map or unordered_map) to reduce memory usage.
3. Replace the array `vis` with a smaller array or a bitset to reduce memory usage.
4. Update the first loop to keep track of the maximum value of `t` instead of using a separate variable.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Replace the recursive function `Gcd` with the Euclidean algorithm to improve efficiency.
   - The Euclidean algorithm for calculating the GCD of two numbers `a` and `b` is as follows:
     ```
     int Gcd(int a, int b) {
       while (b != 0) {
         int temp = b;
         b = a % b;
         a = temp;
       }
       return a;
     }
     ```
   - This algorithm has a time complexity of O(log(min(a,b))) instead of O(max(a,b)).
   - The updated code for `Gcd` is as follows:
     ```
     int Gcd(int a, int b) {
       while (b != 0) {
         int temp = b;
         b = a % b;
         a = temp;
       }
       return a;
     }
     ```

2. Replace the array `num` with a dynamic data structure (e.g., map or unordered_map) to reduce memory usage.
   - The array `num` is used to store the frequency of each element divided by the GCD.
   - Since the maximum value of `t` is known, a dynamic data structure such as a map or unordered_map can be used to store only the non-zero frequencies.
   - The updated code for `num` is as follows:
     ```
     unordered_map<int, int> num;
     ```
     (Note: Make sure to include the `<unordered_map>` header.)

3. Replace the array `vis` with a smaller array or a bitset to reduce memory usage.
   - The array `vis` is used to mark the elements that have been visited in the loop.
   - Since the maximum value of `t` is known, a smaller array or a bitset can be used to mark the visited elements.
   - The updated code for `vis` is as follows:
     ```
     bool vis[maxx + 1];
     memset(vis, 0, sizeof(vis));
     ```
     (Note: Make sure to include the `<cstring>` header for the `memset` function.)

4. Update the first loop to keep track of the maximum value of `t` instead of using a separate variable.
   - Instead of using a separate variable `maxx` to store the maximum value of `t`, we can update `maxx` during the loop itself.
   - The updated code for the first loop is as follows:
     ```
     int maxx = 0, t;
     for (register int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
       t = a[i] / g;
       num[t]++;
       if (t > maxx) {
         maxx = t;
       }
     }
     ```

  bool vis[maxx + 1];
  memset(vis, 0, sizeof(vis));
  int cnt = 0;
  t = 0;
  for (register int i = 2; i <= maxx; i++) {
    if (vis[i] == 0) {
      t = 0;
      for (register int j = i; j <= maxx; j += i) {
        t += num[j];
        vis[j] = 1;
