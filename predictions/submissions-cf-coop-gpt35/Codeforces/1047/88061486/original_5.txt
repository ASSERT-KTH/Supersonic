Code Analysis:
1. The code includes unnecessary headers that are not used in the program, such as <algorithm>, <cmath>, <cstdio>, <cstring>, <ctime>, <iostream>, <queue>, and <stack>.
2. The macro definitions for "maxn" and "M" are not used in the code.
3. The function "Gcd" calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) using a recursive approach. However, a more efficient algorithm, such as Euclid's algorithm, can be used to calculate the GCD.
4. The program uses an array "a" to store the input numbers and calculates the GCD of all the numbers in the array. Then, it divides each number by the GCD and counts the occurrences of the resulting numbers.
5. The program uses an array "num" to store the count of each resulting number and an array "vis" to mark the visited numbers.
6. The program iterates through the resulting numbers to find the maximum count.
7. The program prints the result based on the maximum count.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Remove unnecessary header files to reduce compile time and memory usage.
2. Replace the recursive GCD function with a more efficient algorithm, such as Euclid's algorithm.
3. Use a more efficient data structure to count the occurrences of resulting numbers, such as a hash table or an unordered_map.
4. Avoid unnecessary iterations by optimizing the algorithm for finding the maximum count.
5. Apply compiler optimizations, such as loop unrolling or pragma directives, to improve performance.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Remove unnecessary header files:
   - Remove the unnecessary header files <algorithm>, <cmath>, <cstdio>, <cstring>, <ctime>, <iostream>, <queue>, and <stack> from the code.

2. Replace the recursive GCD function:
   - Replace the GCD function with the standard library function "std::gcd" from the <numeric> header. This function uses Euclid's algorithm to calculate the GCD efficiently.

3. Use a more efficient data structure:
   - Replace the array "num" with an unordered_map<int, int> to count the occurrences of resulting numbers. This will reduce the memory usage and improve the efficiency of counting.

4. Optimize the algorithm for finding the maximum count:
   - Instead of iterating through all the resulting numbers, iterate only through the numbers that are not marked as visited in the "vis" array.
   - Update the maximum count and mark all the multiples of the current number as visited.

5. Apply compiler optimizations:
   - Add compiler optimizations, such as loop unrolling or pragma directives, to hint the compiler to optimize the code. For example, use "#pragma GCC optimize" to enable compiler optimizations.

Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <cstdio>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <numeric>

int main() {
  int n;
  std::scanf("%d", &n);

  int g = 0;
  int a;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    std::scanf("%d", &a);
    g = std::gcd(g, a);
  }

  std::unordered_map<int, int> num;
  int maxx = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    int t = a / g;
    num[t]++;
    maxx = std::max(maxx, t);
  }

  int cnt = 0;
  for (int i = 2; i <= maxx; i++) {
    if (num.find(i) != num.end()) {
      cnt = std::max(cnt, num[i]);
      for (int j = i; j <= maxx; j += i) {
        num.erase(j);
      }
    }
  }

  if (cnt == 0) {
    std::printf("-1\n");
  } else {
    std::printf("%d\n", n - cnt);
  }

  return 0;
}
```

The optimized code minimizes unnecessary iterations and improves memory usage by using an unordered_map to count the occurrences of resulting numbers. It also replaces the recursive GCD function with std::gcd from the <numeric> header. Compiler optimizations, such as loop unrolling or pragma directives, can be added to further improve performance.
