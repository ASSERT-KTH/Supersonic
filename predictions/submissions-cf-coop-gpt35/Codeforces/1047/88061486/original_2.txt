Code Analysis:
- The code starts by including necessary header files.
- The `Gcd` function calculates the greatest common divisor of two numbers.
- The main function reads input, calculates the greatest common divisor, and then counts the frequency of each number divided by the greatest common divisor.
- Finally, it finds the maximum frequency and prints the difference between the total number of elements and the maximum frequency.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Remove unnecessary header files: The code includes several unnecessary header files such as `<cmath>`, `<cstdio>`, `<cstring>`, `<ctime>`, `<iostream>`, `<queue>`, and `<stack>`. These should be removed to improve compilation time.
2. Replace recursive Gcd function with an iterative version: The `Gcd` function is currently implemented recursively, which may lead to stack overflow for large inputs. We can replace it with an iterative version to avoid recursion overhead.
3. Optimize the loop for calculating the greatest common divisor: The current loop for calculating the greatest common divisor iterates over the entire array. We can optimize this loop by checking for the greatest common divisor only when necessary.
4. Optimize the loop for counting frequencies: The loop for counting frequencies can be optimized by using a more efficient data structure instead of an array to store the frequencies.
5. Optimize the loop for finding the maximum frequency: The loop for finding the maximum frequency can be optimized by avoiding unnecessary iterations and using a more efficient data structure to store visited numbers.
6. Use a more efficient data type for storing frequencies: The current code uses an array `num[]` to store frequencies, which requires a large amount of memory. We can use a more memory-efficient data structure to store frequencies.
7. Optimize the printing of the final result: The code uses an `if-else` statement to print the final result. We can simplify this by using a conditional operator.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Remove unnecessary header files: Remove the unnecessary header files `<cmath>`, `<cstdio>`, `<cstring>`, `<ctime>`, `<iostream>`, `<queue>`, and `<stack>`.

2. Replace recursive Gcd function with an iterative version:
```cpp
int Gcd(int a, int b) {
  while (b > 0) {
    int temp = b;
    b = a % b;
    a = temp;
  }
  return a;
}
```
The iterative version of the `Gcd` function avoids recursion overhead and is more efficient.

3. Optimize the loop for calculating the greatest common divisor:
Replace the loop for calculating the greatest common divisor with a single line of code:
```cpp
g = Gcd(g, a[i]);
```
This line calculates the greatest common divisor between the previous `g` and the current element `a[i]`.

4. Optimize the loop for counting frequencies:
Replace the array `num[]` with an `unordered_map<int, int>` to store frequencies:
```cpp
unordered_map<int, int> freq;
for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
  t = a[i] / g;
  freq[t]++;
  if (t > maxx) {
    maxx = t;
  }
}
```
By using an `unordered_map`, we can directly access and update the frequencies without iterating over the entire array.

5. Optimize the loop for finding the maximum frequency:
Replace the loop for finding the maximum frequency with the following code:
```cpp
unordered_set<int> visited;
for (int i = 2; i <= maxx; i++) {
  if (visited.find(i) == visited.end()) {
    t = 0;
    for (int j = i; j <= maxx; j += i) {
      t += freq[j];
      visited.insert(j);
    }
    if (t > cnt) {
      cnt = t;
    }
  }
}
```
By using an `unordered_set`, we can keep track of visited numbers and avoid unnecessary iterations.

6. Use a more efficient data type for storing frequencies:
Replace the `unordered_map<int, int>` with a `vector<int>` to store frequencies:
```cpp
vector<int> freq(maxx + 1, 0);
for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
  t = a[i] / g;
  freq[t]++;
  if (t > maxx) {
    maxx = t;
  }
}
```
Using a `vector` reduces memory usage compared to an `unordered_map`.

7. Optimize the printing of the final result:
Replace the `if-else` statement with a conditional operator:
```cpp
printf("%d\n", cnt == 0 ? -1 : n - cnt);
```
This simplifies the code and improves readability.

Optimized Code:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_set>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <vector>

#define LL long long
#define maxn 300010
#define M 15000010

using namespace std;

int Gcd(int a, int b) {
  while (b > 0) {
    int temp = b;
    b = a % b;
    a = temp;
  }
  return a;
}

int main() {
  int n, g;
  scanf("%d", &n);
  for (register int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    scanf("%d", &a[i]);
    if (i == 1) {
      g = Gcd(a[0], a[1]);
    } else if (i > 1) {
      g = Gcd(g, a[i]);
    }
  }
  int maxx = 0, t;
  vector<int> freq(maxx + 1, 0);
  for (register int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    t = a[i] / g;
    freq[t]++;
    if (t > maxx) {
      maxx = t;
    }
  }
  int cnt = 0;
  t = 0;
  unordered_set<int> visited;
  for (register int i = 2; i <= maxx; i++) {
    if (visited.find(i) == visited.end()) {
      t = 0;
      for (register int j = i; j <= maxx; j += i) {
        t += freq[j];
        visited.insert(j);
      }
      if (t > cnt) {
        cnt = t;
      }
    }
  }
  printf("%d\n", cnt == 0 ? -1 : n - cnt);
  return 0;
}
```

The optimized code improves performance by using more efficient data structures and algorithms. It reduces memory usage by replacing the array `num[]` with a `vector<int>` and the unnecessary header files are removed. The code is also simplified and easier to read.
