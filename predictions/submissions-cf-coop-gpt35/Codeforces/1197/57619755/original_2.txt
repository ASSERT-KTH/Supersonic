Upon analyzing the given code, the following potential optimizations can be identified:

1. Inefficient data structure: The code uses a simple array `a` to store the input values. However, using a `vector` instead of a fixed-size array can provide more flexibility and efficient memory usage.

2. Redundant computations: The `sum` variable is used to calculate the sum of elements in each iteration of the outer loop. However, this can be avoided by maintaining a running sum and updating it for each iteration.

3. Suboptimal loop condition: The inner loop condition `j >= 0 && i - j <= m` can be optimized. Since `j` starts from `i - 1`, it will always be greater than or equal to 0. Therefore, the condition `j >= 0` is redundant and can be removed.

4. Compiler optimizations: The code includes compiler pragmas to optimize the code using the `-O3` optimization level and unroll loops. These pragmas can help the compiler generate more efficient code.

Based on these observations, the following optimization steps can be proposed:

1. Replace the fixed-size array `a` with a `vector` to improve memory usage and flexibility.

2. Replace the `sum` variable with a running sum to avoid redundant computations.

3. Remove the redundant loop condition `j >= 0` in the inner loop.

4. Keep the compiler pragmas for optimization.

Here is the optimized code block:

```cpp
#pragma GCC optimize("O3", "unroll-loops")
#pragma GCC target("avx2")
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
#define ll long long

int main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(0);

  ll n, m, k, ans = 0;
  cin >> n >> m >> k;

  vector<ll> a(n + 1);
  for (ll i = 1; i <= n; i++)
    cin >> a[i];

  vector<ll> dp(n + 1);

  for (ll i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    ll sum = 0;
    for (ll j = i - 1; i - j <= m; j--) {
      dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + sum - k);
      sum += a[j];
    }
    ans = max(ans, dp[i]);
  }

  cout << ans;
  return 0;
}
```

In this optimized code, the changes made are minimal yet effective. The fixed-size array `a` has been replaced with a `vector` to improve memory usage and flexibility. The `sum` variable has been replaced with a running sum to avoid redundant computations. The redundant loop condition `j >= 0` has been removed. The compiler pragmas for optimization have been retained.

These optimizations aim to improve the efficiency of the code by reducing redundant computations and improving memory usage. The trade-off is a slight increase in code complexity due to the use of additional data structures and the removal of redundant code. However, the overall performance gain outweighs this trade-off.
