The provided code calculates the maximum sum of a subarray of length at most `m` in an array `a`, with a constraint that each element in the subarray must be reduced by `k`. The code uses dynamic programming to calculate the maximum sum for each index `i` and stores the results in the array `dp`. Finally, it outputs the maximum sum.

To optimize this code, we can focus on the following areas:

1. Unnecessary memory usage: The array `dp` is declared with a size of `1005000`. However, the loop index `i` only goes up to `n`, which means that we only need an array of size `n`. Therefore, we can reduce the size of `dp` to `n` to save memory.

2. Redundant calculations: The code calculates the sum of the subarray for each index `i` in the outer loop. However, we can optimize this by calculating the sum incrementally. Instead of recalculating the sum for each index, we can update the sum by subtracting `a[j+1]` and adding `a[i]` in each iteration of the inner loop.

3. Loop optimization: The inner loop iterates from `i-1` to `0`. However, since `j` is used to access `dp[j]` and `a[j]`, it should start from `i` instead of `i-1`. This way, we can avoid accessing out-of-bounds memory.

4. Compiler optimizations: The provided code includes two pragmas to hint the compiler to optimize the code. The first pragma hints the compiler to use aggressive optimizations (`O3`), and the second pragma targets the AVX2 instruction set. These pragmas can help the compiler generate more efficient code.

Based on these optimizations, here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#pragma GCC optimize("O3", "unroll-loops")
#pragma GCC target("avx2")
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(0);

  int n, m, k;
  cin >> n >> m >> k;

  vector<int> a(n + 1);
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++)
    cin >> a[i];

  vector<int> dp(n + 1);
  int ans = 0;
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    int sum = a[i];
    for (int j = i; j > 0 && i - j + 1 <= m; j--) {
      dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j - 1] + sum - k);
      sum += a[j - 1];
    }
    ans = max(ans, dp[i]);
  }

  cout << ans;
  return 0;
}
```

The optimizations made in this code improve the efficiency by reducing unnecessary memory usage and redundant calculations. The code also uses a `vector` instead of a plain array, which provides better memory management and avoids out-of-bounds errors.

Note: The code assumes that the input values `n`, `m`, and `k` are within the required constraints. It does not handle any edge cases or error checking.
