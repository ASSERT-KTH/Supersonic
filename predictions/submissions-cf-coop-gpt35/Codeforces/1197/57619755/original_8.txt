Optimization Strategy:

1. Use a more efficient data structure to store the input array `a`. The current array `a` is defined as `a[1005000]`, which is unnecessary and wastes memory. Since the size of the array is given by `n`, we can declare `a` as a dynamic array of size `n` instead.

2. Avoid unnecessary computations by eliminating redundant calculations. In the inner loop, the condition `i - j <= m` is checked in every iteration. However, this condition is equivalent to `j >= i - m`. We can change the loop condition to `j >= i - m` to avoid computing `i - j` in every iteration.

3. Optimize the inner loop by using prefix sums. The inner loop calculates the sum of elements from index `j` to `i`. This can be optimized using prefix sums, where we calculate the cumulative sums of the elements in array `a` beforehand. Then, we can calculate the sum of elements from index `j` to `i` in constant time using the prefix sums.

4. Consider loop unrolling for the inner loop. Loop unrolling is a technique where multiple iterations of a loop are combined into a single iteration. This can potentially improve performance by reducing loop overhead and instruction cache misses.

5. Utilize compiler optimizations. The `#pragma` directives at the beginning of the code suggest compiler optimizations, such as loop unrolling (`unroll-loops`) and vectorization (`avx2`). These optimizations can be helpful in improving performance, but their effectiveness may vary depending on the specific hardware and compiler being used.

Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. Replace the declaration of array `a` with a dynamic array of size `n`:
```cpp
ll* a = new ll[n];
```
2. Change the condition in the inner loop from `i - j <= m` to `j >= i - m`:
```cpp
for (int j = i - 1; j >= max(0, i - m); j--)
```
3. Calculate prefix sums of array `a` before the outer loop:
```cpp
ll* prefixSum = new ll[n + 1];
prefixSum[0] = 0;
for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++)
  prefixSum[i] = prefixSum[i - 1] + a[i];
```
4. Modify the inner loop to use prefix sums and loop unrolling:
```cpp
for (int j = i - 1; j >= max(0, i - m); j -= 4) {
  ll sum = prefixSum[i] - prefixSum[j];
  dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + sum - k);
  if (j >= 1) {
    sum += a[j];
    dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j - 1] + sum - k);
  }
  if (j >= 2) {
    sum += a[j - 1];
    dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j - 2] + sum - k);
  }
  if (j >= 3) {
    sum += a[j - 2];
    dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j - 3] + sum - k);
  }
}
```
5. Delete the dynamic arrays `a` and `prefixSum` after they are no longer needed:
```cpp
delete[] a;
delete[] prefixSum;
```

Optimized Code:

```cpp
#pragma GCC optimize("O3", "unroll-loops")
#pragma GCC target("avx2")
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
#define ll long long
ll n, m, k, ans, sum, dp[1005000];
int main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(0);
  cin >> n >> m >> k;
  ll* a = new ll[n];
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    cin >> a[i];
  ll* prefixSum = new ll[n + 1];
  prefixSum[0] = 0;
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++)
    prefixSum[i] = prefixSum[i - 1] + a[i - 1];
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    sum = a[i - 1];
    for (int j = i - 1; j >= max(0, i - m); j -= 4) {
      ll sum = prefixSum[i] - prefixSum[j];
      dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + sum - k);
      if (j >= 1) {
        sum += a[j - 1];
        dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j - 1] + sum - k);
      }
      if (j >= 2) {
        sum += a[j - 2];
        dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j - 2] + sum - k);
      }
      if (j >= 3) {
        sum += a[j - 3];
        dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j - 3] + sum - k);
      }
    }
    ans = max(ans, dp[i]);
  }
  cout << ans;
  delete[] a;
  delete[] prefixSum;
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized code reduces memory usage by declaring `a` as a dynamic array of size `n` instead of a fixed-size array. It also eliminates redundant calculations by changing the loop condition in the inner loop and using prefix sums to calculate the sum of elements. Additionally, loop unrolling is applied to the inner loop to potentially improve performance. Finally, the dynamic arrays `a` and `prefixSum` are deleted after they are no longer needed to free up memory.
