The provided code calculates whether a given number is a perfect square and a prime number. It does this by first generating a sieve of prime numbers up to a certain limit (here, 1000000) and then checking if the number is a perfect square and if the square root of the number is a prime number.

However, there are several areas where this code can be optimized for efficiency:

1. Avoid using the `bits/stdc++.h` header: This header includes all standard library headers, which can lead to excessive memory usage. Instead, include only the necessary headers, such as `<iostream>` for input/output and `<cmath>` for mathematical functions like `sqrt`.

2. Remove unnecessary preprocessor directives: The `#define` directives for `ll` and `endl` are not used in the code and can be removed.

3. Optimize the `power` function: The `power` function uses a loop to calculate the power of a number. This can be optimized using exponentiation by squaring, which reduces the number of multiplications required. Additionally, the function can be made recursive to improve readability and reduce code duplication.

4. Optimize the `sieve` function: The `sieve` function uses an array to store whether each number is prime or not. However, this array is unnecessarily large and can be reduced in size to match the maximum prime number needed. Additionally, the loop can be optimized to start from 2 and only iterate up to the square root of the maximum prime number.

5. Avoid unnecessary calculations: The code calculates the square of the input number using `trex * trex` and then checks if it is equal to the input number. This can be optimized by directly checking if the square root of the number is an integer.

6. Optimize the output: Instead of printing "YES" or "NO" for each number, it would be more efficient to store the results in an array or vector and then print them all at once after the loop.
