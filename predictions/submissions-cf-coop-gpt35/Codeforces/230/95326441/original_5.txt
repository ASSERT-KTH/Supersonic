Code Analysis:
1. The code uses the `bits/stdc++.h` header, which includes many standard C++ libraries. This can result in slower compilation times and may not be necessary for this specific program.
2. The `power` function calculates the power of a number using an iterative approach. However, it can be optimized further.
3. The `sieve` function uses the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to find prime numbers up to a given number. This function can be optimized by reducing the loop range and using a more memory-efficient data structure.
4. The main loop iterates over `n` numbers and performs various calculations to check if each number is a perfect square and a prime number. There are some unnecessary calculations and checks that can be eliminated.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Remove the unnecessary header `bits/stdc++.h` and include only the necessary headers (`iostream`, `cmath`, `vector`, `algorithm`) to reduce compilation time and avoid potential conflicts.
2. Optimize the `power` function by using exponentiation by squaring, which reduces the number of multiplications required.
3. Optimize the `sieve` function by using a `vector<bool>` instead of an array of booleans. This reduces memory usage and allows for more efficient access.
4. Simplify the main loop by eliminating unnecessary calculations and checks. Instead of checking if `a` is a perfect square, we can directly find if `trex * trex` is equal to `a`.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Remove the unnecessary header `bits/stdc++.h` and include only the necessary headers (`iostream`, `cmath`, `vector`, `algorithm`) to reduce compilation time and avoid potential conflicts.
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
```

2. Optimize the `power` function by using exponentiation by squaring.
- Replace the `power` function with the following optimized implementation:
```cpp
ll power(ll a_power, ll b_power) {
  ll result_power = 1;
  while (b_power > 0) {
    if (b_power % 2 == 1) {
      result_power *= a_power;
    }
    a_power *= a_power;
    b_power /= 2;
  }
  return result_power;
}
```
- Explanation:
  - The original code uses a simple iterative approach to calculate the power of a number. However, this can be optimized further using the exponentiation by squaring algorithm.
  - In each iteration, we check if `b_power` is odd by using the condition `b_power & 1`. However, this can be simplified to `b_power % 2 == 1` for better readability.
  - Instead of calculating `a_power * a_power` in each iteration, we can square `a_power` using `a_power *= a_power` to reduce the number of multiplications.
  - Finally, we divide `b_power` by 2 in each iteration to reduce it by half and move towards the base case.

3. Optimize the `sieve` function by using a `vector<bool>` instead of an array of booleans.
- Replace the `isPrime` array with a `vector<bool> isPrime` in the `sieve` function.
- Modify the initialization of `isPrime` to use the `vector` constructor:
```cpp
void sieve(ll maxPrime) {
  vector<bool> isPrime(maxPrime + 1, true);
  ...
}
```
- Explanation:
  - Using a `vector<bool>` instead of an array of booleans reduces memory usage because the `vector<bool>` implementation packs each boolean into a single bit.
  - Initializing the `vector` with `maxPrime + 1` elements and setting them all to `true` simplifies the code and ensures that the indices match the numbers being checked.

4. Simplify the main loop by eliminating unnecessary calculations and checks.
- Replace the main loop with the following optimized version:
```cpp
for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
  cin >> a;
  ll trex = sqrt(a);
  if (trex * trex == a && isPrime[trex]) {
    cout << "YES" << endl;
  } else {
    cout << "NO" << endl;
  }
}
```
- Explanation:
  - Instead of assigning `trex` and then calculating `crex`, we can directly check if `trex * trex` is equal to `a`.
  - We can combine the conditions to check if `trex * trex` is equal to `a` and if `trex` is prime in a single `if` statement to avoid unnecessary `else` checks.

Optimized Code:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;
#define ll long long
#define endl "\n"
#define MOD 1000000007

ll power(ll a_power, ll b_power) {
  ll result_power = 1;
  while (b_power > 0) {
    if (b_power % 2 == 1) {
      result_power *= a_power;
    }
    a_power *= a_power;
    b_power /= 2;
  }
  return result_power;
}

void sieve(ll maxPrime) {
  vector<bool> isPrime(maxPrime + 1, true);
  isPrime[0] = isPrime[1] = false;
  for (int i = 2; i * i <= maxPrime; i++) {
    if (isPrime[i]) {
      for (int j = i * i; j <= maxPrime; j += i) {
        isPrime[j] = false;
      }
    }
  }
}

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  cout.tie(0);

  ll n, a;
  cin >> n;
  sieve(1000000);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> a;
    ll trex = sqrt(a);
    if (trex * trex == a && isPrime[trex]) {
      cout << "YES" << endl;
    } else {
      cout << "NO" << endl;
    }
  }

  return 0;
}
```

This optimized code reduces unnecessary calculations, uses a more memory-efficient data structure, and simplifies the main loop. It should result in improved performance and reduced memory usage compared to the original code.
