The given code appears to be a program that checks whether a given number is a perfect square and a prime number. It uses the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to generate a boolean array indicating whether each number up to a given maximum prime is prime or not. Then, it iterates through each number, checks if it is a perfect square, and checks if the square root of the number is a prime number.

Upon analyzing the code, I have identified several potential optimization opportunities:

1. Remove unnecessary header files: The code includes the entire `<bits/stdc++.h>` header, which is not necessary for this program. Instead, we can include only the necessary header files, such as `<iostream>` and `<cmath>`.

2. Improve variable naming: The variable names used in the code are not descriptive. It would be beneficial to use more meaningful names to improve code readability.

3. Optimize the `power` function: The `power` function uses a loop to calculate the power of a number. This can be optimized by using the exponentiation by squaring algorithm, which reduces the number of multiplications needed.

4. Optimize the `sieve` function: The `sieve` function uses a boolean array to store whether each number is prime or not. However, the array size is fixed at 1000001, which is not efficient for larger inputs. It would be better to dynamically allocate the array based on the maximum prime number needed.

5. Avoid unnecessary computations: The code calculates the square root of a number multiple times, even if the number is not a perfect square. We can optimize this by calculating the square root only once and storing it in a variable.

6. Remove redundant checks: The code checks if a number is a perfect square and then checks if its square root is a prime number. However, if the number is not a perfect square, we already know that its square root is not a prime number. We can avoid the redundant check in this case.

7. Simplify the logic for printing the result: The code uses nested if-else statements to determine whether to print "YES" or "NO". We can simplify this logic by using a ternary operator.

Based on these observations, I will now provide an optimized version of the code.
