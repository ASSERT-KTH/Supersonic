Code Analysis:
1. The code uses `memset` to initialize the `flag` array to `true` and then manually sets `flag[1]` to `false`. This can be optimized to directly initialize `flag[1]` as `false` and the rest of the array as `true`.
2. The code uses `vector` to store prime numbers. However, it is not necessary to store all the prime numbers up to 1,000,000. We only need to check if a number is prime or not. Therefore, instead of storing all the prime numbers, we can use a more efficient algorithm to check for primes.
3. The code calculates the square root of each input number using `sqrt` function. This can be optimized by using integer arithmetic instead of floating-point arithmetic.
4. The code uses `cout` to print "YES" or "NO" for each input number. It would be more efficient to store the results in a `vector` and print them all at once after the loop.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Initialize `flag[1]` as `false` and the rest of the `flag` array as `true`, without using `memset`.
2. Use a more efficient algorithm to check for prime numbers, instead of storing all the prime numbers in a `vector`.
3. Replace the `sqrt` function with integer arithmetic to calculate the square root of input numbers.
4. Store the results in a `vector` and print them all at once after the loop.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Remove the `memset` function and directly initialize `flag[1]` as `false` and the rest of the `flag` array as `true`.
2. Replace the `Prem` function with a more efficient algorithm to check for prime numbers. This can be done by iterating from 2 to the square root of the input number and checking for divisibility.
3. Replace the `sqrt` function with integer arithmetic to calculate the square root of input numbers. This can be done by iterating from 1 to the input number and checking if the square of the current number is equal to the input number.
4. Store the results in a `vector` and print them all at once after the loop. This can be done by pushing the results into a `vector` and then printing them using a loop.

Optimized Code:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <cmath>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

bool isPrime(int n) {
  if (n < 2)
    return false;
  for (int i = 2; i * i <= n; i++) {
    if (n % i == 0)
      return false;
  }
  return true;
}

int main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(0);
  
  int n;
  int a;
  vector<string> results;
  
  cin >> n;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> a;
    if (isPrime(a) && isPerfectSquare(a)) {
      results.push_back("YES");
    } else {
      results.push_back("NO");
    }
  }
  
  for (const auto& result : results) {
    cout << result << "\n";
  }
  
  return 0;
}
