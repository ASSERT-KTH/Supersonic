Code Analysis:
1. The code uses the `sqrt` function to check if a number is a perfect square.
2. The code uses an array `flag` to mark numbers as prime or not.
3. The code uses a vector `k` to store prime numbers.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Remove unnecessary includes: The code includes unnecessary headers (`algorithm`, `cmath`, `cstring`, `iostream`) that are not required for the current implementation. Removing them will reduce compilation time.
2. Improve array initialization: The code uses `memset` to initialize the `flag` array. However, since `flag` is a boolean array, we can use `std::fill` to initialize it with `true` values.
3. Use a more efficient prime sieve algorithm: The current implementation uses the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm, which is efficient for generating prime numbers, but it can be further optimized.
4. Avoid unnecessary conversions: The code converts the result of `sqrt` to `long long`. Instead, we can use an integer variable to check if the number is a perfect square.
5. Optimize the prime number check: Instead of checking if a number is prime by accessing the `flag` array, we can use the prime numbers stored in the `k` vector to perform a binary search for faster lookup.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Remove unnecessary includes: Remove the unnecessary headers (`algorithm`, `cmath`, `cstring`, `iostream`) since they are not used in the current implementation.

2. Improve array initialization: Replace the `memset` call with `std::fill` to initialize the `flag` array with `true` values. This will improve code readability and remove the need for `memset`.

3. Use a more efficient prime sieve algorithm: Replace the existing `Prem` function with an optimized version of the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm. The optimized sieve algorithm includes the following improvements:
   a. Use a fixed-size array instead of a vector: Instead of using a vector, use a fixed-size array to store prime numbers. This avoids dynamic memory allocation and improves cache locality.
   b. Use a separate boolean array to mark composites: Instead of using a single boolean array to mark prime numbers, use a separate boolean array to mark composites. This reduces the number of operations required to mark non-prime numbers.
   c. Optimize the inner loop: The inner loop can be optimized by starting from the square of the current prime number and incrementing by `2 * prime`. This ensures that only odd multiples of the prime number are marked as composites, reducing the number of iterations required.

4. Avoid unnecessary conversions: Instead of converting the result of `sqrt` to `long long`, use an integer variable to check if the number is a perfect square. This eliminates the need for the floating-point conversion and comparison.

5. Optimize the prime number check: Instead of accessing the `flag` array to check if a number is prime, use the prime numbers stored in the `k` vector to perform a binary search. This reduces the time complexity of the prime number check from linear to logarithmic.

Optimized Code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

const int MAX_N = 1000010;
bool flag[MAX_N];
int primes[MAX_N];

void prem() {
    std::fill(flag, flag + MAX_N, true);
    flag[0] = flag[1] = false;
    int primeCount = 0;

    for (int i = 2; i < MAX_N; i++) {
        if (flag[i]) {
            primes[primeCount++] = i;
            for (int j = i * i; j < MAX_N; j += 2 * i) {
                flag[j] = false;
            }
        }
    }
}

bool isPerfectSquare(int n) {
    int root = sqrt(n);
    return root * root == n;
}

int main() {
    std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
    std::cin.tie(0);

    int n;
    std::cin >> n;

    prem();

    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        long long a;
        std::cin >> a;

        if (!isPerfectSquare(a) || !std::binary_search(primes, primes + MAX_N, (int)sqrt(a))) {
            std::cout << "NO\n";
        } else {
            std::cout << "YES\n";
        }
    }

    return 0;
}
```

The optimized code makes the following changes:
1. Removes unnecessary includes.
2. Replaces `memset` with `std::fill` for array initialization.
3. Replaces the `Prem` function with an optimized version of the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm.
4. Uses an integer variable to check if a number is a perfect square.
5. Uses `std::binary_search` to check if a number is prime.

Trade-offs:
1. The optimized code may be slightly more complex due to the changes in the prime sieve algorithm.
2. The optimized code uses a fixed-size array for prime numbers, which limits the maximum number of primes that can be stored. However, this limitation is unlikely to be reached in practice given the input constraints mentioned in the code.
