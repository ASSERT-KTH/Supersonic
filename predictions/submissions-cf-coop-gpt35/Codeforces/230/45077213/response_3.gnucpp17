Code Analysis:
1. The code uses an array `flag` to store whether a number is prime or not. It initializes all the elements of `flag` to `true` using `memset`.
2. The code then calls the `Prem` function to generate all prime numbers up to 1000000 and store them in the vector `k`.
3. The code then reads an integer `n` and for each value of `n` it checks whether it is a perfect square and if the square root is a prime number or not.

Optimization Strategy:
1. The `memset` operation is not necessary because `flag` is already initialized to `true` for all elements.
2. The `Prem` function can be optimized by using the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to generate prime numbers instead of the current algorithm.
3. The check for perfect square can be optimized by using integer arithmetic instead of floating-point arithmetic.
4. The check for prime numbers can be optimized by checking divisibility only up to the square root of the number.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Remove the `memset` operation because it is not needed.
2. Replace the `Prem` function with the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to generate prime numbers. This algorithm marks all multiples of each prime number as composite, thus generating a list of prime numbers.
3. Replace the floating-point arithmetic with integer arithmetic for checking perfect square.
4. Optimize the check for prime numbers by checking divisibility only up to the square root of the number.
