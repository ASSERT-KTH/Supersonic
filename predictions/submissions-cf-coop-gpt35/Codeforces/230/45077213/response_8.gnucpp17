Upon analyzing the given code, I have identified a few potential areas for optimization:

1. Unnecessary inclusion of headers: The code includes unnecessary headers such as `<algorithm>` and `<vector>`. Since these headers are not used in the code, they can be removed to reduce compilation time and improve code readability.

2. Inefficient memory usage: The code uses two arrays, `x` and `flag`, to store prime numbers and a flag indicating whether a number is prime or not. However, these arrays are not used effectively. Instead of storing all numbers up to 1000000 in the `x` array, we can use the `flag` array to store only the prime numbers. This will reduce memory usage and improve cache efficiency.

3. Redundant square root calculation: The code calculates the square root of each input number `a` to check if it is a perfect square. However, this calculation is unnecessary since we can directly check if the number is a perfect square without calculating its square root.

4. Inefficient loop iteration: The `Prem` function uses a nested loop to mark non-prime numbers in the `flag` array. However, we can optimize this loop by using the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm, which eliminates the need for the inner loop.

Based on these observations, I propose the following optimization strategy:

1. Remove unnecessary headers: Remove the unnecessary headers `<algorithm>` and `<vector>`.

2. Optimize memory usage: Remove the `x` array and modify the `flag` array to store only prime numbers.

3. Eliminate square root calculation: Instead of calculating the square root of each input number, directly check if it is a perfect square.

4. Optimize the `Prem` function: Implement the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to mark non-prime numbers in the `flag` array.
