Code Analysis:
- The code begins by including the necessary header files and defining some macros.
- The `SPF()` function initializes the `spf` array with prime factors.
- The `main()` function takes input for the number of test cases and an array of integers.
- It then checks if each number in the array is a perfect square and if its square root is a prime number.
- Finally, it prints "YES" or "NO" based on the above condition.

Potential Performance Bottlenecks:
1. The `SPF()` function precomputes the smallest prime factor for each number up to 1000000. This computation can be time-consuming and can be optimized.
2. The code checks if each number is a perfect square by calculating its square root using the `sqrt()` function. This function can be expensive and can be optimized.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Improve `SPF()` function:
   - Currently, the `SPF()` function initializes the `spf` array by assigning each index to itself. This is unnecessary because the initialization should already be done by default.
   - The outer loop iterates up to the square root of the maximum number, but it can be optimized to iterate up to the maximum number itself.
   - The inner loop iterates from `i` to `i * i`, which can be optimized to iterate from `i * i` to `n` with a step size of `i`.
   - Overall, these changes will reduce the time complexity of the `SPF()` function.

2. Improve square root calculation:
   - Instead of using the `sqrt()` function, we can compare the square of an integer with the given number to check if it is a perfect square. This will avoid the overhead of calculating square roots.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Improve `SPF()` function:
   - Remove the unnecessary initialization of the `spf` array.
   - Change the outer loop condition from `i * i < 1000001` to `i < 1000001`.
   - Change the inner loop from `for (int j = i; j * i < 1000001; ++j)` to `for (int j = i * i; j < 1000001; j += i)`.
   - These changes will optimize the initialization of the `spf` array.

2. Improve square root calculation:
   - Replace the condition `root * root == a` with `root * root == a * a` to avoid using the `sqrt()` function.
   - This change will optimize the square root calculation and improve performance.
