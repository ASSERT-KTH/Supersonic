The given code calculates whether each input number is a perfect square and if it is, whether it is also a prime number. The program first initializes an array `spf` using the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to store the smallest prime factor for each number from 2 to 1000000. Then, it reads an integer `n` from the input, followed by `n` integers. For each input number, it checks if it is a perfect square and if its square root is a prime number. If both conditions are satisfied, it sets the corresponding element in the `ans` array to 1, otherwise it remains 0. Finally, it prints "YES" or "NO" for each element in the `ans` array.

Let's analyze the code to identify potential optimizations.

1. Inefficient Data Structure:
   - The array `spf` is declared as `spf[1000001]`, which is not necessary since the maximum value of `i` in the second loop is `sqrt(1000001) = 1000`. Therefore, the array can be reduced to `spf[1001]`.
   - The array `ans` is declared as `ans[n]` and all elements are initialized to 0. However, the program only sets elements to 1 when certain conditions are met. Instead of initializing the entire array, we can change the program to dynamically store and print the result as we process each input number.

2. Redundant Computations:
   - The program calculates the square root of each input number twice: once to check if it is a perfect square and again to check if its square root is a prime number. We can optimize this by calculating the square root only once and storing it in a variable.
   - The check `a != 1` is unnecessary because the condition `root * root == a` already guarantees that `a` is not 1. We can remove this redundant check.

3. Loop Optimization:
   - The second loop iterates over all elements of the `ans` array and prints "YES" or "NO" based on the value of each element. Instead of iterating over the array, we can directly print the result as we process each input number.

4. Compiler Optimization:
   - We can use compiler optimizations to optimize the generated machine code. For example, we can use the `-O3` flag to enable aggressive optimization levels during compilation.

Based on these observations, let's optimize the code step by step.
