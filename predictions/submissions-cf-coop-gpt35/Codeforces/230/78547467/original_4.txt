This code aims to determine whether a given number is a perfect square and a prime number at the same time. The code initializes an array `spf` to store the smallest prime factor of each number from 1 to 1000000. It then reads an integer `n`, followed by `n` integers. For each input number, the code checks if it is a perfect square and if its square root is a prime number. The result is printed as "YES" if the number satisfies these conditions, and "NO" otherwise.

Now, let's analyze the code for potential optimizations.

1. **Unnecessary includes**: The code includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header, which is not recommended because it includes all standard library headers, leading to increased compilation time and unnecessary memory usage. It would be better to include only the necessary headers.

2. **Global array**: The `spf` array is declared as a global variable. While this is not inherently wrong, it is generally considered better practice to limit the scope of variables as much as possible. In this case, it would be more appropriate to declare `spf` within the `SPF` function.

3. **Redundant check**: The code checks if `a` is equal to 1 before checking if it is a perfect square. This check is unnecessary because a perfect square cannot be equal to 1. We can remove this check to improve efficiency.

4. **Inefficient loop**: The loop that checks if a number is a perfect square iterates over all numbers from 0 to `n-1`. Instead of doing this, we can calculate the square root of each number only once and store it in a variable for later use.

5. **Inefficient output**: The code prints "YES" or "NO" for each number individually. This can be optimized by storing the results in an array and printing them all at once after the loop.

6. **Redundant memory allocation**: The `ans` array is initialized with zeros, but this is not necessary since we are assigning values to its elements within the loop. We can remove this initialization to save memory.

Now that we have identified potential optimizations, let's proceed with the optimization strategy.
