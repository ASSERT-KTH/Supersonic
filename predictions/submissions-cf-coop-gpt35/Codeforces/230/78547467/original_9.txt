The given code checks if each number in the input array is a perfect square and if its square root is also a prime number. It then prints "YES" if the conditions are satisfied, and "NO" otherwise.

Here are some potential optimizations for the given code:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The code includes the entire `bits/stdc++.h` library, which is not required. Instead, include only the necessary headers, such as `<iostream>` and `<cmath>`.

2. Avoid using `using namespace std;`: While using `using namespace std;` is convenient, it is considered bad practice in large codebases. Instead, explicitly specify the namespace for each standard library function, such as `std::cout` and `std::cin`.

3. Use a more efficient data structure for `spf[]`: The `spf[]` array is used to store the smallest prime factor of each number. Currently, it is implemented as a simple array. However, we can optimize it by using a `std::vector` instead, which provides dynamic resizing and better memory management.

4. Remove unnecessary modulo operation: The code defines a constant `mod` but never uses it. If it is not needed, remove it from the code.

5. Avoid repeated calculations: The code calculates the square root of each number multiple times. Instead, calculate it once and store it in a variable for reuse.

6. Optimize the loop conditions: The outer loop runs from 0 to `n`, and within each iteration, it checks if `ans[t]` is equal to 1. We can optimize this by using a range-based loop to directly iterate over `ans` and eliminate the need for the index variable `t`.

7. Use a more efficient way to check if a number is a perfect square: Currently, the code checks if a number is a perfect square by calculating its square root and comparing it to the original number. However, this can be done more efficiently by checking if the square of the integer square root is equal to the original number.

8. Use a more efficient way to check if a number is prime: Currently, the code checks if a number is prime by iterating from 2 to the square root of the number and checking if any number divides it. This can be optimized by using the smallest prime factor array `spf[]` and checking if it equals the number itself.

Now, let's implement these optimizations step-by-step in the code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <cmath>

void SPF(std::vector<int>& spf) {
  spf[0] = spf[1] = -1;
  for (int i = 2; i < spf.size(); ++i)
    spf[i] = i;
  for (int i = 2; i * i < spf.size(); ++i) {
    if (spf[i] == i) {
      for (int j = i; j * i < spf.size(); ++j)
        spf[i * j] = i;
    }
  }
}

int main() {
  int n;
  std::cin >> n;
  
  std::vector<int> spf(1000001);
  SPF(spf);
  
  int a;
  std::vector<bool> ans(n, false);
  
  for (int t = 0; t < n; ++t) {
    std::cin >> a;
    int root = std::sqrt(a);
    if (a != 1 && root * root == a && spf[root] == root)
      ans[t] = true;
  }
  
  for (const auto& flag : ans) {
    if (flag)
      std::cout << "YES" << std::endl;
    else
      std::cout << "NO" << std::endl;
  }
  
  return 0;
}
```

With these optimizations, we have improved the efficiency of the code by using a more efficient data structure for `spf[]`, avoiding unnecessary calculations, and optimizing the loop conditions. The code is now cleaner and more readable while preserving the functionality and output of the original code.
