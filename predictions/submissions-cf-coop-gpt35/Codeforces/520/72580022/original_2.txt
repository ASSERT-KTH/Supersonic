The given code appears to check if a given string contains all 26 English alphabets at least once. The code reads an integer `n` and a string `s`, converts all characters in `s` to lowercase, and then counts the frequency of each character using a `map`. Finally, it checks if the count of distinct characters is equal to 26 and prints "YES" if true, and "NO" otherwise.

To optimize this code, we can make the following changes:

1. Remove unnecessary header files: The code includes several unnecessary header files such as `<algorithm>`, `<cmath>`, `<cstdlib>`, `<ctime>`, `<deque>`, `<iomanip>`, `<queue>`, `<set>`, `<stack>`, `<stdexcept>`, and `<vector>`. Since these headers are not used in the code, we can remove them.

2. Remove unnecessary macros: The code includes several unnecessary macros such as `sf`, `sfl`, `sff`, `sffl`, `sfff`, `sfffl`, `ll gcd`, `ll lcm`, `my_sizeof`, `watch`, `all`, `per`, `rep`, `ppr`, `REP`, `sz`, `vec`, `MAX`, `MIN`, `ll`, `endl`, and `pi`. These macros are either unused or have syntax errors. We can remove them.

3. Optimize the `isprime` function: The `isprime` function checks if a number is prime by iterating from 3 to the square root of the number. However, we can make a few optimizations:
   - We can start the loop from 2 and increment `i` by 2 in each iteration, as we have already checked if the number is divisible by 2.
   - We can check divisibility of the number by 2 separately before the loop, and then iterate from 3 to the square root of the number with a step of 2.
   - We can return `false` immediately if the number is divisible by `i`, instead of continuing the loop.
   - We can use the `ll` type for `i` to avoid integer overflow.

4. Optimize the counting of distinct characters: The code uses a `map` to count the frequency of each character in the string. However, we can optimize this process by using an array of size 26 to directly count the frequency of each character. We can iterate over the string and increment the corresponding count in the array.

5. Use a boolean variable instead of an integer: Instead of using an integer variable `c` to count the number of distinct characters, we can use a boolean variable `found` initialized to `false`. We can set `found` to `true` whenever we encounter a distinct character.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#define _CRT_SECURE_NO_WARNINGS
#include <iostream>
#include <map>
#include <string>

void open() {
#ifndef ONLINE_JUDGE
  freopen("input.txt", "r", stdin);
  freopen("output.txt", "w", stdout);
#endif
}

void Adnan() {
  std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0);
  std::cin.tie(0);
  std::cout.tie(0);
}

bool isprime(long long n) {
  if (n < 2)
    return false;
  if (n == 2)
    return true;
  if (n % 2 == 0)
    return false;
  for (long long i = 3; i * i <= n; i += 2) {
    if (n % i == 0)
      return false;
  }
  return true;
}

int main() {
  open();
  Adnan();

  int n;
  std::string s;
  std::cin >> n >> s;

  int count[26] = {0};
  for (char c : s) {
    c = tolower(c);
    count[c - 'a']++;
  }

  bool found = false;
  for (int i = 0; i < 26; i++) {
    if (count[i] >= 1) {
      found = true;
      break;
    }
  }

  if (found)
    std::cout << "YES";
  else
    std::cout << "NO";

  return 0;
}
```

By optimizing the code as described above, we have removed unnecessary header files and macros, optimized the `isprime` function, improved the counting of distinct characters, and used a boolean variable instead of an integer. These changes should result in improved performance and reduced memory usage.
