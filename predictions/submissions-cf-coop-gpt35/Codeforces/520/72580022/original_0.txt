Upon analyzing the given code, I have identified several potential areas for optimization:

1. Unnecessary Header Files: The code includes multiple unnecessary header files, such as `algorithm`, `cmath`, `cstdlib`, `ctime`, `deque`, `iomanip`, `queue`, `set`, `stack`, and `stdexcept`. These header files are not used in the code and can be removed.

2. Redundant Macros: The code includes several redundant macros, such as `sf`, `sfl`, `sff`, `sffl`, `sfff`, `sfffl`, `ll`, `my_sizeof`, `watch`, `all`, `per`, `rep`, `ppr`, `REP`, `sz`, `vec`, `MAX`, `MIN`, `ll`, `endl`, and `pi`. These macros are not used in the code and can be removed.

3. Inefficient String Conversion: The code converts each character of the input string to lowercase using the `tolower` function. This conversion is unnecessary and can be avoided.

4. Inefficient Map Iteration: The code iterates over the map `mp` to count the number of unique characters in the input string. This can be optimized by tracking the count while iterating over the string itself.

5. Inefficient Output: The code outputs "YES" or "NO" based on the count of unique characters in the input string. Instead of using an if-else statement, a ternary operator can be used to simplify the code.

To optimize the code, I propose the following steps:

Step 1: Remove unnecessary header files.

Step 2: Remove redundant macros.

Step 3: Remove the conversion of characters to lowercase.

Step 4: Optimize the counting of unique characters in the input string.

Step 5: Use a ternary operator for output.

The optimized code is as follows:
