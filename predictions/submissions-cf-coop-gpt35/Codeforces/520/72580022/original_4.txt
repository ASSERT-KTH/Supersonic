Code Analysis:
1. The code includes multiple unnecessary header files, such as <cstdlib>, <ctime>, <deque>, <iomanip>, <queue>, <set>, <stack>, <stdexcept>, and <stdlib.h>. These are not used in the code and can be removed.
2. The code defines multiple unnecessary macros, such as sf, sfl, sff, sffl, sfff, sfffl, ll, my_sizeof, watch, per, rep, ppr, REP, sz, vec, MAX, MIN, ll, endl, and pi. These macros are not used in the code and can be removed.
3. The code defines multiple unnecessary functions, such as gcd and lcm. These functions are not used in the code and can be removed.
4. The code includes an unused function called "open". This function can be removed.
5. The code includes unnecessary comments and empty lines, which can be removed to improve code readability.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Remove unnecessary header files, macros, and functions to reduce code complexity and improve compilation time.
2. Avoid unnecessary computations and data conversions. For example, the code unnecessarily converts characters to lowercase and calculates the size of a string in each iteration.
3. Use more efficient data structures and algorithms to minimize memory usage and improve performance. For example, instead of using a map to count the frequency of characters, we can use a boolean array of size 26 to store the presence of each character.
4. Utilize compiler optimizations, such as loop unrolling and inline expansion, to improve performance.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Remove unnecessary header files, macros, and functions. This will reduce code complexity and improve compilation time.

2. Avoid unnecessary computations and data conversions. Instead of converting characters to lowercase in each iteration, we can convert the entire string to lowercase once before the loop. Additionally, we can store the size of the string in a variable instead of calculating it in each iteration.

3. Use a more efficient data structure to count the frequency of characters. Instead of using a map, we can use a boolean array of size 26 to store the presence of each character. This will reduce memory usage and improve performance.

4. Utilize compiler optimizations, such as loop unrolling and inline expansion, to improve performance. We can use pragmas or compiler flags to enable these optimizations.

Optimized Code Block:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

bool isprime(int n) {
  if (n < 2)
    return false;
  if (n == 2)
    return true;
  if (n % 2 == 0)
    return false;
  for (int i = 3; i * i <= n; i += 2) {
    if (n % i == 0)
      return false;
  }
  return true;
}

int main() {
  string s;
  int n, c = 0;
  cin >> n >> s;

  // Convert the entire string to lowercase
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    s[i] = tolower(s[i]);
  }

  // Use a boolean array to store the presence of each character
  bool present[26] = {false};
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    present[s[i] - 'a'] = true;
  }

  // Count the number of unique characters
  for (int i = 0; i < 26; i++) {
    if (present[i]) {
      c++;
    }
  }

  if (c == 26)
    cout << "YES";
  else
    cout << "NO";

  return 0;
}
```

This optimized code removes unnecessary header files, macros, and functions. It also avoids unnecessary computations and data conversions by converting the entire string to lowercase once before the loop and storing the size of the string in a variable. Additionally, it uses a boolean array instead of a map to count the frequency of characters, reducing memory usage. Finally, it preserves the functionality and output of the original code while improving performance.
