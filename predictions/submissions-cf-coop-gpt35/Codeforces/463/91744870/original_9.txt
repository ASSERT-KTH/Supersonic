The given code seems to be a solution to a problem that involves finding the maximum sum of elements in a grid, subject to the constraint that no two chosen elements share a row or column. The code uses a brute force approach to solve the problem, iterating over all possible pairs of elements and calculating the sum for each pair.

To optimize this code, we can focus on the following aspects:

1. Avoiding unnecessary memory usage: The code currently uses a 2D array `a` to store the input grid, which is not necessary. We can directly calculate the sum of elements for each pair `(i, j)` without storing the entire grid. This will save memory usage.

2. Avoiding unnecessary calculations: The code currently calculates the sums `cnt[i + j]` and `cnt1[i - j]` for each element `(i, j)` in the grid. However, these sums can be pre-calculated before iterating over the grid to avoid redundant calculations.

3. Optimizing the update process: The code currently iterates over all elements in the grid and updates the maximum sum and corresponding indices for each pair `(i, j)`. We can optimize this process by directly calculating the maximum sum and indices in a single pass over the grid.

4. Compiler optimizations: We can use compiler optimizations and pragma directives to hint the compiler to optimize certain parts of the code.

Now, let's proceed with optimizing the code step by step.
