The given code seems to be solving a problem that involves finding the maximum sum of elements in a matrix when two elements are selected such that they are not in the same row or column. 

Let's analyze the code to identify potential optimizations:

1. Unnecessary imports: The code includes the entire `<bits/stdc++.h>` library, which is not recommended. It is better to include only the necessary libraries.

2. Data types: The code uses `ll` and `ull` data types, which are not necessary for this problem. We can use `int` instead.

3. Memory allocation: The code uses a 2D array `a[n][n]` to store the matrix elements. This can be inefficient in terms of memory usage. We can optimize this by using a 1D vector and calculating the matrix index using a formula.

4. Redundant calculations: The code calculates the sum of elements for each row and column multiple times. We can optimize this by calculating the sum only once and storing it in a separate array.

5. Loop optimization: The code uses nested loops to iterate over the matrix elements. We can optimize this by using a single loop and calculating the row and column indices using a formula.

6. Output optimization: The code prints the output using multiple `cout` statements. We can optimize this by storing the output in a string and printing it all at once.
