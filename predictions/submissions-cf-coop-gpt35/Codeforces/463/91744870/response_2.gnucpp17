Code Analysis:
- The code includes unnecessary header files.
- There are several unnecessary typedefs and macros.
- The code uses a 2D array to store the input, which can be inefficient for large inputs.
- The code uses a map to calculate the sum of elements in each diagonal, which can be inefficient for large inputs.
- The code uses a vector to store the sums and coordinates, which can be inefficient for large inputs.
- The code uses a loop to iterate through the input and update the sums and coordinates, which can be optimized.
- The code prints the output in a specific format, which is not necessary for performance optimization.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Remove unnecessary header files.
2. Remove unnecessary typedefs and macros.
3. Use a more efficient data structure to store the input.
4. Calculate the sums of elements in each diagonal without using a map.
5. Use variables instead of vectors to store the sums and coordinates.
6. Optimize the loop to update the sums and coordinates.
7. Remove unnecessary output formatting.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Remove unnecessary header files:
   - The code includes "bits/stdc++.h" header file, which includes all standard C++ headers. This can increase compilation time and unnecessary dependencies. Instead, include only the required headers.
   
2. Remove unnecessary typedefs and macros:
   - The code includes several typedefs and macros that are not used. Remove them to simplify the code and improve readability.

3. Use a more efficient data structure to store the input:
   - The code currently uses a 2D array to store the input. However, this can be inefficient for large inputs as it requires contiguous memory allocation. Instead, use a 1D array or a vector to store the input.

4. Calculate the sums of elements in each diagonal without using a map:
   - The code uses a map to calculate the sum of elements in each diagonal. However, this can be inefficient for large inputs as it requires hashing and memory allocation. Instead, calculate the sums directly by iterating through the input.

5. Use variables instead of vectors to store the sums and coordinates:
   - The code uses a vector to store the sums and coordinates. However, this can be inefficient for large inputs as it requires dynamic memory allocation. Instead, use variables to store the sums and coordinates.

6. Optimize the loop to update the sums and coordinates:
   - The code currently uses a nested loop to iterate through the input and update the sums and coordinates. However, this can be optimized by using a single loop and calculating the sums and coordinates directly.

7. Remove unnecessary output formatting:
   - The code prints the output in a specific format, which is not necessary for performance optimization. Remove the formatting to simplify the code.
