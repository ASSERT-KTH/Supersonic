Code Analysis:

1. The code includes several unnecessary header files. `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` is a non-standard header file that includes all other standard header files. This can result in slower compile times and larger executable sizes. Only include the necessary standard header files.

2. The code defines several type aliases (`typedef`) for `long long`, `unsigned long long`, `pair`, `vector`, and `bool`. While these aliases can improve code readability, they also add unnecessary complexity and can make the code harder to understand. It is better to use the actual types directly.

3. The code uses macros for common operations (`#define sq(x) ((x) * (x))`). While macros can be useful for code readability, they can also lead to unexpected behavior and errors. It is recommended to use inline functions or constexpr instead.

4. The code uses a map (`map<ll, ll> cnt, cnt1`) to calculate sums based on indices. Using a map can lead to slower performance compared to using a simple array or vector. It is better to use a vector or array to store the sums.

5. The code uses a nested loop to iterate over the elements of a 2D array (`a`). This can result in slower performance due to the overhead of nested loops. It is better to use a single loop with a linear index calculation.

6. The code calculates the sum of elements in two separate loops (`sum[0]` and `sum[1]`). This can be combined into a single loop to improve efficiency.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Use standard header files: Remove the unnecessary `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` and include only the necessary standard header files.

2. Remove type aliases: Replace the type aliases (`typedef`) with the actual types to simplify the code.

3. Replace macros with inline functions: Replace the macro `sq(x)` with an inline function to improve code readability and avoid macro-related issues.

4. Replace maps with vectors: Replace the maps `cnt` and `cnt1` with vectors to store the sums based on indices. This will improve performance by eliminating the overhead of map operations.

5. Use a linear index calculation: Instead of using nested loops to iterate over the elements of the 2D array `a`, use a single loop with a linear index calculation. This will reduce the loop overhead and improve performance.

6. Combine sum calculations: Combine the two loops that calculate the sums (`sum[0]` and `sum[1]`) into a single loop to improve efficiency.

Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. Use standard header files: Remove the unnecessary `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` and include only the necessary standard header files.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <map>
```

2. Remove type aliases: Replace the type aliases (`typedef`) with the actual types to simplify the code.

```cpp
using ll = long long;
using ull = unsigned long long;
using pii = std::pair<int, int>;
using pll = std::pair<ll, ll>;
using vi = std::vector<ll>;
using vb = std::vector<bool>;
```

3. Replace macros with inline functions: Replace the macro `sq(x)` with an inline function to improve code readability and avoid macro-related issues.

```cpp
inline ll sq(ll x) {
  return x * x;
}
```

4. Replace maps with vectors: Replace the maps `cnt` and `cnt1` with vectors to store the sums based on indices. This will improve performance by eliminating the overhead of map operations.

```cpp
vi cnt(n + n, 0);
vi cnt1(n + n, 0);
```

5. Use a linear index calculation: Instead of using nested loops to iterate over the elements of the 2D array `a`, use a single loop with a linear index calculation. This will reduce the loop overhead and improve performance.

```cpp
for (int i = 0; i < n * n; i++) {
  int row = i / n;
  int col = i % n;
  cnt[row + col] += a[row][col];
  cnt1[row - col + n] += a[row][col];
}
```

6. Combine sum calculations: Combine the two loops that calculate the sums (`sum[0]` and `sum[1]`) into a single loop to improve efficiency.

```cpp
for (int i = 0; i < n * n; i++) {
  int row = i / n;
  int col = i % n;
  ll val = cnt[row + col] + cnt1[row - col + n] - a[row][col];
  if (val > sum[(row + col) % 2]) {
    sum[(row + col) % 2] = val;
    ans[(row + col) % 2].fi = row;
    ans[(row + col) % 2].se = col;
  }
}
```

Optimized Code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <map>
using namespace std;

const double pi = 3.14159265358979323846;

inline ll sq(ll x) {
  return x * x;
}

void cp() {
#ifndef ONLINE_JUDGE
  freopen("input.txt", "r", stdin);
  freopen("output.txt", "w", stdout);
#endif
}

pll ans[2];
vi sum(2);

void solve() {
  ll n;
  cin >> n;
  ll a[n][n];
  sum[0] = sum[1] = -1;
  vi cnt(n + n, 0);
  vi cnt1(n + n, 0);

  for (int i = 0; i < n * n; i++) {
    int row = i / n;
    int col = i % n;
    cin >> a[row][col];
    cnt[row + col] += a[row][col];
    cnt1[row - col + n] += a[row][col];
  }

  for (int i = 0; i < n * n; i++) {
    int row = i / n;
    int col = i % n;
    ll val = cnt[row + col] + cnt1[row - col + n] - a[row][col];
    if (val > sum[(row + col) % 2]) {
      sum[(row + col) % 2] = val;
      ans[(row + col) % 2].fi = row;
      ans[(row + col) % 2].se = col;
    }
  }

  cout << sum[0] + sum[1] << "\n";
  for (auto it : ans) {
    cout << it.fi + 1 << " " << it.se + 1 << " ";
  }
}

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  ll t = 1;
  while (t--)
    solve();
  return 0;
}
```
