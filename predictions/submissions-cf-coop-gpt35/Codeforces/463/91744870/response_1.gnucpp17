The given code is a C++ program that solves a problem related to a matrix. The program reads a square matrix of size `n` from the input and performs some calculations to find the maximum sum of two elements in the matrix. It then outputs the maximum sum and the positions of the two elements.

Upon initial analysis, here are some potential performance bottlenecks and areas for optimization:

1. Memory Usage: The program uses a 2D array `a` of size `n x n` to store the matrix. This can be quite memory-intensive, especially for large values of `n`. Consider using a more memory-efficient data structure.

2. Unnecessary Map Usage: The program uses two `map` containers, `cnt` and `cnt1`, to store the sums of matrix elements based on their indices. However, the purpose of these maps is unclear, as their values are not used directly. It might be possible to eliminate the maps and perform the calculations directly within the nested loops.

3. Redundant Calculation: The `update` function is called for each element of the matrix, even if the sum calculated for that element is not greater than the current maximum sum. This can be optimized by only calling the `update` function when necessary.

4. Slow Input/Output: The program uses `cin` and `cout` for input and output, which can be relatively slow for large inputs/outputs. Consider using faster input/output methods like `scanf` and `printf`.

Based on these observations, here is an optimization strategy:

1. Replace the 2D array `a` with a 1D vector `a` of size `n*n`. This will reduce memory usage and improve cache efficiency.

2. Eliminate the `map` containers `cnt` and `cnt1`. Instead, calculate the sums directly within the nested loops and update the maximum sum and corresponding indices.

3. Optimize the `update` function to avoid redundant calculations. Only call the function when necessary, i.e., when the calculated sum is greater than the current maximum sum.

4. Replace `cin` and `cout` with `scanf` and `printf` for faster input/output.
