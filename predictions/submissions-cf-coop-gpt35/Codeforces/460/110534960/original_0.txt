The given code appears to be a C++ program that solves a problem involving the calculation of an optimal value. The program reads input from the standard input, performs some calculations, and then prints the result to the standard output.

To optimize this program, we can focus on the `check` function, as it is the most computationally intensive part of the code. The `check` function is used to determine whether a given value `x` satisfies certain conditions. The function iterates over the input array `h` and performs some calculations based on the current element and the previous elements.

Here is the step-by-step optimization plan:

1. Avoid unnecessary memory allocation:
   - The `vl s(n, 0ll)` statement creates a vector `s` of size `n` and initializes all elements to zero. However, this initialization is not necessary since the elements of `s` will be updated in the loop. We can avoid this unnecessary memory allocation and initialization by declaring `s` as an empty vector: `vl s;`.

2. Optimize the loop:
   - The loop in the `check` function iterates over the input array `h` and performs calculations based on the current and previous elements. However, the current implementation has some redundant calculations that can be eliminated.
   - Instead of calculating `cur -= s[i - w]` in every iteration, we can move this calculation outside the loop and update `cur` only when `i >= w`. This will save unnecessary calculations for the first `w` elements.
   - Similarly, we can move the calculation of `mm += s[i]` outside the loop and update `mm` only when `s[i]` is non-zero. This will save unnecessary calculations when `s[i]` is zero.
   - Finally, we can remove the `continue` statement inside the loop, as it is not necessary.

3. Optimize the binary search:
   - The program uses a binary search algorithm to find the maximum value `x` that satisfies the conditions in the `check` function.
   - The current implementation uses the binary search algorithm correctly, but we can make a small optimization by changing the condition in the `check` function from `if (mm > m)` to `if (mm >= m)`. This will allow us to find the maximum value `x` that satisfies the conditions without having to perform an additional iteration.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include "bits/stdc++.h"
using namespace std;
typedef long long ll;
typedef unsigned long long ull;
typedef long double ld;
typedef pair<int, int> pii;
typedef pair<ll, ll> pll;
typedef vector<int> vi;
typedef vector<ll> vl;
#define all(v) v.begin(), v.end()
#define FASTBOI                                                                \
  ios::sync_with_stdio(0);                                                     \
  cin.tie(0);                                                                  \
  cout.tie(0);
const int N = 1e5 + 70;
const ll M = 1e9 + 7;
ll gcd(ll a, ll b) { return !b ? a : gcd(b, a % b); }
ll lcm(ll a, ll b) { return (a / gcd(a, b)) * b; }
ll n, m, w, h[N];
bool check(ll x) {
  vl s;
  ll cur = 0, mm = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    if (i >= w)
      cur -= s[i - w];
    if (h[i] + cur < x) {
      s.push_back(x - h[i] - cur);
      cur += s.back();
      mm += s.back();
    }
  }
  return mm >= m;
}
void solve() {
  scanf("%lld%lld%lld", &n, &m, &w);
  ll mn = 1e18;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
    scanf("%lld", h + i), mn = min(mn, h[i]);
  ll l = 0, r = mn + m, ans = 0;
  while (l <= r) {
    ll md = l + ((r - l) >> 1);
    if (check(md)) {
      ans = max(ans, md);
      l = md + 1;
    } else {
      r = md - 1;
    }
  }
  printf("%lld", ans);
}
int main() {
  int t = 1;
  for (int tt = 1; tt <= t; ++tt) {
    solve();
    puts("");
  }
}
```

By following this optimization plan, we have reduced unnecessary memory allocation, eliminated redundant calculations, and optimized the binary search algorithm. These changes should improve the performance and reduce the memory usage of the program.
