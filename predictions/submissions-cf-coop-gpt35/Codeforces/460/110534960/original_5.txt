The given code appears to be solving a problem that involves finding the maximum height of a tower given some constraints. The main bottleneck in this code is the `check` function, which is called repeatedly in a binary search loop. The `check` function calculates the number of additional blocks required to make the tower of height `x` feasible, and this calculation is done for every possible height in the binary search loop. This calculation involves iterating over the entire `h` array and maintaining a sliding window of size `w`.

To optimize this code, we can make the following improvements:
1. Avoid unnecessary array initialization: The `vl s(n, 0ll)` line initializes an array with all elements set to zero. However, this array is only used temporarily in the `check` function and can be avoided altogether.
2. Optimize the sliding window calculation: Instead of recalculating the sliding window sum for every element, we can maintain a running sum and update it incrementally. This can be done by subtracting the value of the element that falls outside the window and adding the value of the element that enters the window.
3. Optimize the loop condition: The current loop condition `i < n` can be optimized to `i < n - w + 1` since there is no need to iterate over elements that cannot form a window of size `w`.
4. Optimize the binary search: The binary search loop can be optimized by using a simpler condition and eliminating unnecessary calculations. Instead of using `l + ((r - l) >> 1)` to calculate the middle element, we can use `(l + r) / 2`. Additionally, we can eliminate the `max` function and update `ans` directly.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include "bits/stdc++.h"
using namespace std;
typedef long long ll;
typedef unsigned long long ull;
typedef long double ld;
typedef pair<int, int> pii;
typedef pair<ll, ll> pll;
typedef vector<int> vi;
typedef vector<ll> vl;
#define all(v) v.begin(), v.end()
#define FASTBOI                                                                \
  ios::sync_with_stdio(0);                                                     \
  cin.tie(0);                                                                  \
  cout.tie(0);
const int N = 1e5 + 70;
const ll M = 1e9 + 7;
ll gcd(ll a, ll b) { return !b ? a : gcd(b, a % b); }
ll lcm(ll a, ll b) { return (a / gcd(a, b)) * b; }
ll n, m, w, h[N];
bool check(ll x) {
  ll cur = 0, mm = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < n - w + 1; ++i) {
    if (i - w >= 0)
      cur -= h[i - w];
    if (h[i] >= x)
      continue;
    if (h[i] + cur < x) {
      ll additional_blocks = x - h[i] - cur;
      cur += additional_blocks;
      mm += additional_blocks;
    }
    if (mm > m)
      return false;
  }
  return true;
}
void solve() {
  scanf("%lld%lld%lld", &n, &m, &w);
  ll mn = 1e18;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
    scanf("%lld", h + i), mn = min(mn, h[i]);
  ll l = 0, r = mn + m, ans = 0;
  while (l <= r) {
    ll md = (l + r) / 2;
    if (check(md)) {
      ans = md;
      l = md + 1;
    } else {
      r = md - 1;
    }
  }
  printf("%lld", ans);
}
int main() {
  int t = 1;
  for (int tt = 1; tt <= t; ++tt) {
    solve();
    puts("");
  }
}
```

These optimizations reduce unnecessary memory usage, simplify the sliding window calculation, and improve the efficiency of the binary search loop. The overall time complexity of the code remains the same, but the optimized code should run faster due to the reduced number of operations and memory accesses.
