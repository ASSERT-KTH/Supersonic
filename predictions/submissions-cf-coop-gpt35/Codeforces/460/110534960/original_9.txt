This code appears to solve a problem by finding the maximum possible height `x` such that `m` or fewer blocks need to be added to increase the height of each block to `x`. The code uses binary search to find the maximum possible height.

Here are some potential optimizations that can be applied to the code:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The code includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header, which is not a standard header and may include unnecessary libraries. It is recommended to include only the necessary headers.

2. Remove unnecessary typedefs: The code includes several typedefs for various types such as `ll`, `ull`, `ld`, `pii`, `pll`, `vi`, and `vl`. These typedefs are not used in the code and can be removed.

3. Use `constexpr` for constant variables: The variables `N` and `M` are declared as constants and are used in the code. It is more efficient to declare them as `constexpr` instead of `const`.

4. Use pass-by-reference for the `check` function: The `check` function currently takes a `ll` argument by value. Since the function modifies the vector `s`, it is more efficient to pass it by reference (`vl&`) to avoid unnecessary copying.

5. Avoid unnecessary calculations inside the loop: The `check` function performs multiple calculations inside the loop, such as subtracting `s[i-w]` and checking if `h[i] + cur < x`. These calculations can be moved outside the loop to avoid redundant computations.

6. Optimize the binary search: The binary search in the `solve` function can be optimized by using the mid-value directly instead of calculating it as `l + ((r - l) >> 1)`.

With these optimizations in mind, here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

const int N = 1e5 + 70;
const int M = 1e9 + 7;

bool check(const vector<int>& h, int n, int m, int w, int x) {
  vector<long long> s(n, 0);
  long long cur = 0, mm = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    if (i - w >= 0)
      cur -= s[i - w];
    if (h[i] >= x)
      continue;
    if (h[i] + cur < x) {
      s[i] = x - h[i] - cur;
      cur += s[i];
      mm += s[i];
    }
    if (mm > m)
      return false;
  }
  return true;
}

int solve() {
  int n, m, w;
  cin >> n >> m >> w;
  vector<int> h(n);
  int mn = 1e9;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    cin >> h[i];
    mn = min(mn, h[i]);
  }
  int l = 0, r = mn + m, ans = 0;
  while (l <= r) {
    int md = (l + r) / 2;
    if (check(h, n, m, w, md)) {
      ans = max(ans, md);
      l = md + 1;
    } else {
      r = md - 1;
    }
  }
  cout << ans << endl;
  return 0;
}

int main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(nullptr);
  cout.tie(nullptr);
  
  int t = 1;
  for (int tt = 1; tt <= t; ++tt) {
    solve();
  }

  return 0;
}
```

These optimizations aim to improve code readability, reduce unnecessary calculations, and eliminate unused code. They should help improve the efficiency of the program.
