### Code Analysis

Upon analyzing the given code, the following potential areas for optimization can be identified:

1. The `vector` `s` is being used to store intermediate calculations. However, it is being resized and accessed in each iteration of the loop. Resizing and accessing vectors can be expensive operations, especially if done repeatedly in a loop.

2. The `check` function is called multiple times in the binary search loop. In each call, the vector `s` is initialized to all zeros. This is not necessary since the vector is reset in each call.

3. The `mm` variable is used to keep track of the sum of all elements in the vector `s`. However, this sum can be calculated in constant time using a separate variable.

4. The `check` function returns a boolean value, but it is not necessary to keep track of the exact number of elements that satisfy the condition. Therefore, we can modify the function to return the sum of elements that satisfy the condition, rather than a boolean value.

5. The `scanf` and `printf` functions are used for input and output operations. These functions have a higher time complexity compared to their C++ counterparts (`cin` and `cout`). Therefore, it is recommended to replace them with `cin` and `cout` for improved performance.

### Optimization Strategy

Based on the analysis above, the following optimization steps can be proposed:

1. Replace the `vector` `s` with a single variable `cur` to store the sum of elements that satisfy the condition. This eliminates the need for resizing and accessing the vector in each iteration of the loop.

2. Remove the initialization of the vector `s` in the `check` function, as it is not required.

3. Replace the `mm` variable with a single variable `sum` to keep track of the sum of elements that satisfy the condition. This eliminates the need for iterating over the vector `s` to calculate the sum.

4. Modify the `check` function to return the value of `sum` instead of a boolean value.

5. Replace the `scanf` and `printf` functions with `cin` and `cout` respectively for improved performance.

### Step-by-Step Explanation

1. Replace the `vector` `s` with a single variable `cur` to store the sum of elements that satisfy the condition. This eliminates the need for resizing and accessing the vector in each iteration of the loop.

```cpp
ll cur = 0, mm = 0;
```

2. Remove the initialization of the vector `s` in the `check` function, as it is not required.

```cpp
vl s(n, 0ll);
```

3. Replace the `mm` variable with a single variable `sum` to keep track of the sum of elements that satisfy the condition. This eliminates the need for iterating over the vector `s` to calculate the sum.

```cpp
ll cur = 0, sum = 0;
```

4. Modify the `check` function to return the value of `sum` instead of a boolean value. Update the conditions accordingly.

```cpp
ll check(ll x) {
  ll cur = 0, sum = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    if (i - w >= 0)
      cur -= s[i - w];
    if (h[i] >= x)
      continue;
    if (h[i] + cur < x) {
      cur += x - h[i] - cur;
      sum += x - h[i] - cur;
    }
    if (sum > m)
      return 0;
  }
  return sum;
}
```

5. Replace the `scanf` and `printf` functions with `cin` and `cout` respectively for improved performance.

```cpp
cin >> n >> m >> w;
for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
  cin >> h[i];

cout << ans;
```
