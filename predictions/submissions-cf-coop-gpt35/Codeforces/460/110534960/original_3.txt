The provided code is a C++ program that solves a problem using binary search. The program takes input parameters `n`, `m`, and `w` from the user and an array `h` of size `n`. The goal is to find the maximum height `x` such that it is possible to increase the heights of some elements in the array `h` such that the sum of all the increases is at most `m`.

Here is a step-by-step analysis and optimization strategy for the given code:

1. Inefficient Data Structures:
   - The code uses a vector of long long integers (`vl`) to store the increases in height for each element. However, since the increases are only needed for the current element and the previous `w` elements, a simple array of long long integers can be used instead of a vector to improve memory usage and access time.

2. Redundant Computations:
   - The code computes the minimum height in the array `h` using the `min` function in each iteration of the loop. This computation can be moved outside the loop to improve efficiency.

3. Loop Optimization:
   - The loop in the `check` function iterates over each element of the array `h`. Since the loop only needs to iterate from index `w` to `n-1`, the loop condition can be modified to start the loop from `w` instead of `0`. This optimization will reduce the number of unnecessary iterations.

4. Compiler Optimization:
   - The code can benefit from compiler optimizations such as loop unrolling and function inlining. However, since these optimizations are highly dependent on the compiler and its settings, it is recommended to enable the highest level of optimization (`-O3`) when compiling the code.

Based on the above analysis, here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include "bits/stdc++.h"
using namespace std;
typedef long long ll;
typedef unsigned long long ull;
typedef long double ld;
typedef pair<int, int> pii;
typedef pair<ll, ll> pll;
typedef vector<int> vi;
typedef vector<ll> vl;
#define all(v) v.begin(), v.end()
#define FASTBOI                                                                \
  ios::sync_with_stdio(0);                                                     \
  cin.tie(0);                                                                  \
  cout.tie(0);
const int N = 1e5 + 70;
const ll M = 1e9 + 7;
ll gcd(ll a, ll b) { return !b ? a : gcd(b, a % b); }
ll lcm(ll a, ll b) { return (a / gcd(a, b)) * b; }
ll n, m, w, h[N];
bool check(ll x) {
  ll s[N] = {0};
  ll cur = 0, mm = 0;
  for (int i = w; i < n; ++i) {
    cur -= s[i - w];
    if (h[i] >= x)
      continue;
    if (h[i] + cur < x) {
      s[i] = x - h[i] - cur;
      cur += s[i];
      mm += s[i];
    }
    if (mm > m)
      return 0;
  }
  return 1;
}
void solve() {
  scanf("%lld%lld%lld", &n, &m, &w);
  ll mn = h[0];
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    scanf("%lld", &h[i]);
    mn = min(mn, h[i]);
  }
  ll l = 0, r = mn + m, ans = 0;
  while (l <= r) {
    ll md = l + ((r - l) >> 1);
    if (check(md)) {
      ans = max(ans, md);
      l = md + 1;
    } else {
      r = md - 1;
    }
  }
  printf("%lld", ans);
}
int main() {
  int t = 1;
  for (int tt = 1; tt <= t; ++tt) {
    solve();
    puts("");
  }
}
```

Please note that the optimized code may still contain some areas for further improvement, but the provided optimizations should significantly improve the performance and memory usage of the original code.
