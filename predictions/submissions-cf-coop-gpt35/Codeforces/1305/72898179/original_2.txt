Upon analyzing the provided code, here are some potential areas for optimization:

1. Redundant `#include` statements: The code includes `<bits/stdc++.h>`, which is not a standard C++ header file. It is recommended to include only the necessary header files that are actually used in the code.

2. Macro definitions: The code uses macros `fo`, `ff`, `fd`, `ll`, `pp`, and `hh` to define loop structures and print statements. Using macros can lead to code readability and maintainability issues. It is better to replace these macros with inline functions or regular loops and print statements.

3. Inefficient data structure: The code uses an array `bz` to mark the non-prime numbers and an array `p` to store prime numbers. This approach requires a linear scan to find non-prime numbers and prime numbers, resulting in a time complexity of O(n^2). Instead, the code can use a sieve algorithm to find prime numbers up to a given limit in O(n log log n) time complexity.

4. Unnecessary memory usage: The code defines an array `a` of size N to store the input numbers. However, the code shuffles the array and only uses the first `min(n, 1000)` elements. This leads to unnecessary memory consumption. It is better to use a dynamically allocated array or a vector to store the shuffled elements.

5. Inefficient loop structure: The code uses nested loops to iterate over the prime numbers and calculate the minimum difference between each number and the given input numbers. This results in a time complexity of O(n * p0), where p0 is the number of prime factors. This can be optimized by using a more efficient algorithm to calculate the minimum difference.

Based on the above analysis, here is an optimization strategy:

1. Remove unnecessary `#include` statements and replace them with the required standard C++ headers.

2. Replace the macro definitions with inline functions and regular loops.

3. Optimize the prime number generation by using the sieve algorithm instead of the current approach.

4. Replace the array `a` with a dynamically allocated array or a vector to save memory.

5. Optimize the loop structure to reduce the time complexity.

Now, let's proceed with the step-by-step explanation and the optimized code block.
