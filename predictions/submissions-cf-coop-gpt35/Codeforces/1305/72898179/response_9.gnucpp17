Upon analyzing the provided code, here are some potential optimizations that can be made:

1. Remove unnecessary header file inclusion: The `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` header file includes a large number of other header files, which can increase compile time and memory usage. Instead, we can include only the necessary header files.

2. Remove unnecessary macros: The macros `fo`, `ff`, `fd`, `ll`, `pp`, and `hh` are used for loop iteration and printing purposes. However, these macros make the code less readable and can be replaced with standard C++ constructs.

3. Remove unnecessary global variables: The global variables `p`, `p0`, `u`, `u0`, `w`, `ans` are used to store intermediate results and can be replaced with local variables.

4. Optimize the `sieve` function: The `sieve` function is used to generate prime numbers up to `n`. We can optimize this function by using a more efficient algorithm, such as the Sieve of Eratosthenes.

5. Optimize the `fen` function: The `fen` function is used to factorize a number `n` into its prime factors. We can optimize this function by using a more efficient algorithm, such as trial division.

6. Optimize the `check` function: The `check` function is used to calculate the minimum cost for a given value of `x`. We can optimize this function by using a more efficient algorithm, such as calculating the cost incrementally instead of recalculating it for each value of `x`.

7. Optimize the loop iteration: The loop iteration `fo(i, 1, min(n, 1000))` can be optimized by using a more efficient loop construct, such as a range-based loop.
