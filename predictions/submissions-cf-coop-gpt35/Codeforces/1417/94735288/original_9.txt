Code Analysis:
The given code appears to solve a problem for a given number of test cases. For each test case, it takes an input value of `n`, followed by `n` elements in an array `a`, and an integer value `t`. It then performs some calculations based on the values of `a` and `t` and outputs the result.

Potential Performance Bottlenecks:
1. The code includes unnecessary header files (`<bits/stdc++.h>`) that can slow down the compilation process.
2. The code uses the `cin` and `cout` functions, which are generally slower than other methods of input/output in C++. This can impact the overall running time, especially for larger inputs.
3. The code uses an array (`a[]`) to store the input values. However, using a dynamic data structure like a `vector` might be more efficient, as it can dynamically allocate memory and avoid potential memory wastage.
4. The code performs calculations and checks conditions in a loop, which may result in redundant computations. This can be improved by optimizing these calculations and reducing the number of operations performed inside the loop.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Remove unnecessary header files and replace them with the required ones to improve compilation time.
2. Replace the use of `cin` and `cout` with faster input/output methods such as `scanf` and `printf`.
3. Replace the array `a[]` with a `vector` to improve memory efficiency.
4. Optimize the calculations and conditions inside the loop to reduce the number of operations performed.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Remove unnecessary header files and replace them with the required ones:
   - Remove `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` and replace it with the specific header files required for the program, such as `<iostream>`, `<vector>`, and `<algorithm>`.
2. Replace the use of `cin` and `cout` with faster input/output methods:
   - Remove the line `#define ios ...` and replace it with the necessary `#include` directives for the required input/output methods (`<cstdio>` and `<iostream>`).
   - Replace the usage of `cin` with `scanf` and `cout` with `printf` for faster input/output operations.
3. Replace the array `a[]` with a `vector`:
   - Replace the declaration `int a[n]` with `vector<int> a(n)`.
4. Optimize the calculations and conditions inside the loop:
   - Replace the condition `if (t % 2 == 0 && a[i] == t / 2)` with `if (a[i] == t / 2)`.
   - Combine the conditions `2 * a[i] < t` and `else` into a single condition `else if (2 * a[i] < t)`.
   - Move the variable declaration `int r` outside the loop to avoid repeated declaration and initialization.
   - Replace the `cout` statement inside the loop with `printf` for faster output.

Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

int expo(int base, int exponent, int mod = 1000000007) {
  int ans = 1;
  base %= mod;
  while (exponent != 0) {
    if (exponent & 1)
      ans = (1LL * ans * base) % mod;
    base = (1LL * base * base) % mod;
    exponent >>= 1;
  }
  return ans % mod;
}

int inverse(int x) { return expo(x, 1000000007 - 2, 1000000007); }

void solve() {
  int n, t;
  scanf("%d %d", &n, &t);
  vector<int> a(n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    scanf("%d", &a[i]);
  }
  int curMid = 1;
  int r;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    if (a[i] == t / 2) {
      r = (curMid++) % 2;
    } else if (2 * a[i] < t) {
      r = 0;
    } else {
      r = 1;
    }
    printf("%d ", r);
  }
  printf("\n");
}

int main() {
#ifndef ONLINE_JUDGE
  freopen("input.txt", "r", stdin);
  freopen("output.txt", "w", stdout);
#endif
  int t = 1;
  scanf("%d", &t);
  while (t--) {
    solve();
  }
  return 0;
}
```

The optimized code uses faster input/output methods (`scanf` and `printf`) instead of `cin` and `cout`, replaces the array `a[]` with a `vector` for efficient memory usage, and optimizes the calculations and conditions inside the loop. These changes should result in improved performance and reduced memory usage.
