Code Analysis:
- The code includes unnecessary header files.
- The use of `bits/stdc++.h` is discouraged as it includes all standard library headers, which can result in longer compilation time.
- The `#define` statements are not used in the code.
- The `gcd` and `lcm` macros can be replaced with their respective built-in functions from the `<numeric>` header.
- The `expo` function calculates the exponentiation of a base number. It can be optimized by reducing the number of multiplications and modulo operations.
- The `inverse` function calculates the modular inverse of a number. It can be optimized by using Fermat's little theorem.
- The `solve` function reads input and performs a series of calculations. The logic can be simplified and optimized.
- The `main` function reads the number of test cases and calls the `solve` function for each test case.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Remove unnecessary header files.
2. Replace the `#define` statements with their respective usage in the code.
3. Optimize the `expo` function by reducing the number of multiplications and modulo operations.
4. Optimize the `inverse` function by using Fermat's little theorem.
5. Simplify and optimize the logic in the `solve` function.
6. Remove the unused variable `t` in the `main` function.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Remove unnecessary header files: The `<bits/stdc++.h>` header file includes all standard library headers, which can result in longer compilation time. We can remove it and include only the necessary headers.

2. Replace the `#define` statements: The `#define` statements for `int long long`, `hell`, `endl`, `F`, `S`, `gcd`, `lcm`, and `ios` are not used in the code. We can remove them.

3. Optimize the `expo` function: The `expo` function calculates the exponentiation of a base number. Currently, it performs multiple modulo operations, which can be expensive. We can optimize it by reducing the number of modulo operations. 

   - We can calculate `(base * base) % mod` once and store it in a variable before the loop.
   - Instead of performing modulo operation on `ans` in every iteration, we can perform it only after the loop.
   - We can also remove the `ans % mod` operation at the end, as it is redundant.

4. Optimize the `inverse` function: The `inverse` function calculates the modular inverse of a number. Currently, it uses the `expo` function to calculate the inverse. We can optimize it by using Fermat's little theorem, which states that for a prime modulus `hell`, the inverse of `x` is `x^(hell-2) % hell`. 

   - We can modify the `inverse` function to directly calculate `x^(hell-2) % hell` using the `expo` function.

5. Simplify and optimize the `solve` function: The `solve` function reads input and performs a series of calculations. The logic can be simplified and optimized.

   - We can remove the unused variable `r`.
   - Instead of checking for `t % 2 == 0` and `2 * a[i] < t` separately, we can combine the conditions and use a single if-else statement.
   - We can remove the `curMid` variable and replace it with a single variable `r`, initialized to 1.
   - Instead of printing the result immediately, we can store it in a vector and print the vector at the end.

6. Remove the unused variable `t` in the `main` function.

Optimized Code:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

int expo(int base, int exponent, int mod) {
  int ans = 1;
  base %= mod;
  int baseSquare = (base * base) % mod;
  while (exponent != 0) {
    if (exponent & 1)
      ans = (1LL * ans * base) % mod;
    base = baseSquare;
    exponent >>= 1;
  }
  return ans;
}

int inverse(int x, int mod) {
  return expo(x, mod - 2, mod);
}

void solve() {
  int n, t;
  cin >> n >> t;
  vector<int> a(n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> a[i];
  }
  vector<int> result;
  int r = 1;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    if (2 * a[i] < t) {
      result.push_back(0);
    } else {
      result.push_back(r);
      r = 1 - r;
    }
  }
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cout << result[i] << " ";
  }
  cout << endl;
}

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(0);
  cout.tie(0);
  int t;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    solve();
  }
  return 0;
}
