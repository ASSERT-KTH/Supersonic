Code Analysis:
- The code includes unnecessary header files like `bits/stdc++.h` which can slow down compilation time.
- The code uses a lot of macros which can make the code less readable and harder to maintain.
- The code uses an array `a` to store the input values, but the size of the array is not known at compile-time. This can lead to inefficient memory usage.
- The code uses a loop to read the input values, but it doesn't take advantage of the fact that the input values are already in a contiguous memory block.
- The code uses a loop to calculate the value of `r` for each input value, but it doesn't take advantage of the fact that the value of `r` only depends on whether `a[i]` is less than or greater than `t/2`.
- The code includes unnecessary calculations in the `expo` and `inverse` functions, such as the modulo operation on every iteration of the loop.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Remove unnecessary header files and macros to improve code readability and compilation time.
2. Use a `vector` instead of an array to store the input values, as the size of the input is not known at compile-time.
3. Use the `reserve` function to pre-allocate memory for the `vector`, as the size of the input is known before reading the values.
4. Use the `emplace_back` function to read the input values directly into the `vector`, taking advantage of the fact that the input values are already in a contiguous memory block.
5. Simplify the calculation of `r` by using a conditional expression instead of an if-else statement.
6. Use the `reserve` function to pre-allocate memory for the output values, as the size of the output is known before calculating the values.
7. Use the `emplace_back` function to calculate and store the output values directly into the output `vector`.
8. Use the `reserve` function to pre-allocate memory for the result `vector`, as the size of the result is known before printing the values.
9. Use the `emplace_back` function to concatenate the values of the output `vector` into the result `vector` in a single step.
10. Avoid unnecessary modulo operations in the `expo` and `inverse` functions by applying the modulo operation only once at the end.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Remove unnecessary header files and macros to improve code readability and compilation time.
   - Remove the `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` line and replace it with the necessary standard library headers, such as `<iostream>`.
   - Remove the `#define` macros for constants, as they are not used in the code.
   - Remove the `#define` macros for functions, as they can be replaced with regular function declarations.

2. Use a `vector` instead of an array to store the input values, as the size of the input is not known at compile-time.
   - Replace `int a[n];` with `vector<int> a;`.

3. Use the `reserve` function to pre-allocate memory for the `vector`, as the size of the input is known before reading the values.
   - Add `a.reserve(n);` after reading the values of `n` and `t`.

4. Use the `emplace_back` function to read the input values directly into the `vector`, taking advantage of the fact that the input values are already in a contiguous memory block.
   - Replace the loop `for (i = 0; i < n; i++) { cin >> a[i]; }` with `for (i = 0; i < n; i++) { int value; cin >> value; a.emplace_back(value); }`.

5. Simplify the calculation of `r` by using a conditional expression instead of an if-else statement.
   - Replace the if-else statement with `r = (2 * a[i] >= t) ? 1 : 0;`.

6. Use the `reserve` function to pre-allocate memory for the output values, as the size of the output is known before calculating the values.
   - Add `vector<int> output; output.reserve(n);` before the loop that calculates the values of `r`.

7. Use the `emplace_back` function to calculate and store the output values directly into the output `vector`.
   - Replace `cout << r << " ";` with `output.emplace_back(r);`.

8. Use the `reserve` function to pre-allocate memory for the result `vector`, as the size of the result is known before printing the values.
   - Add `vector<int> result; result.reserve(n);` before the loop that prints the values of `r`.

9. Use the `emplace_back` function to concatenate the values of the output `vector` into the result `vector` in a single step.
   - Replace `cout << endl;` with `result.emplace_back(output.begin(), output.end());`.

10. Avoid unnecessary modulo operations in the `expo` and `inverse` functions by applying the modulo operation only once at the end.
    - Replace `return ans % mod;` with `return ans;` in the `expo` function.
    - Replace `return expo(x, hell - 2, hell);` with `return expo(x, hell - 2);` in the `inverse` function.

Optimized Code Block:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

int expo(int base, int exponent, int mod = 1000000007) {
  int ans = 1;
  base %= mod;
  while (exponent != 0) {
    if (exponent & 1)
      ans = (1LL * ans * base) % mod;
    base = (1LL * base * base) % mod;
    exponent >>= 1;
  }
  return ans;
}

int inverse(int x) {
  return expo(x, 1000000007 - 2);
}

void solve() {
  int n, t;
  cin >> n >> t;
  vector<int> a;
  a.reserve(n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    int value;
    cin >> value;
    a.emplace_back(value);
  }
  vector<int> output;
  output.reserve(n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    int r = (2 * a[i] >= t) ? 1 : 0;
    output.emplace_back(r);
  }
  vector<int> result;
  result.reserve(n);
  result.emplace_back(output.begin(), output.end());
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cout << result[i] << " ";
  }
  cout << endl;
}

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(0);
  cout.tie(0);
  int t = 1;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    solve();
  }
}
