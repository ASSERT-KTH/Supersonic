The given code is for finding useless roads in a road network. It uses the disjoint-set data structure (also known as the union-find data structure) to keep track of the connected components in the network. The code reads an integer `n` as input, which represents the number of nodes in the network. It then reads `n-1` pairs of integers, which represent the roads between nodes. The code uses the union-find operations to determine the connected components and identifies the useless roads.

Upon analysis, the following potential optimizations can be made:

1. **Avoid using "bits/stdc++.h"**: The code currently includes the entire standard library, which can increase compilation time and memory usage. Instead, include only the necessary headers, such as `<iostream>` and `<vector>`.

2. **Avoid using global variables**: The code uses `parent`, `uselessRoads`, `n`, `hb`, and `currURoad` as global variables. It is generally recommended to avoid using global variables as they can increase code complexity and make it harder to reason about the code. Consider encapsulating these variables within a class or function scope.

3. **Avoid unnecessary vector resizing**: The code currently resizes the `parent` vector to size `n` and assigns each element with its index value. However, since the vector is resized to its final size immediately, it is unnecessary to assign each element individually. Instead, use the constructor of `std::vector` to initialize the vector with `n` elements, each initialized with its index value.

4. **Optimize the `find_set` function**: The `find_set` function uses path compression to optimize the find operation in the disjoint-set data structure. However, it can be further optimized by using a recursive approach called path halving. Path halving reduces the path length to half during each find operation, resulting in a more efficient find operation. Implement the path halving optimization in the `find_set` function.

5. **Avoid unnecessary copying of pairs**: The `union_sets` function currently accepts two integers `a` and `b`, which represent the nodes of a road. However, the function then calls `find_set` on `a` and `b` to get the actual representative nodes. Instead of passing `a` and `b`, modify the `union_sets` function to accept the representative nodes directly.

6. **Avoid unnecessary pairs in `uselessRoads`**: The `uselessRoads` vector stores pairs of integers representing the useless roads. However, it is not necessary to store the pairs explicitly. Instead, store only the node indices of the useless roads.

7. **Optimize the loop for finding useless roads**: The loop that iterates over the parent array to find the useless roads can be optimized. Instead of iterating over all nodes, iterate only over the nodes that are representative nodes (i.e., nodes whose parent is themselves). This will reduce the number of iterations and avoid unnecessary checks.

Now, let's implement these optimizations step by step.
