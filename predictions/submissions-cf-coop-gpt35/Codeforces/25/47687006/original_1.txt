The given code implements a union-find algorithm to determine useless roads in a graph. The algorithm starts by initializing each node as a separate set and then iteratively merges sets based on the input roads. Finally, it prints the number of useless roads and the pairs of nodes representing the useless roads.

Upon analyzing the code, the following potential optimizations can be identified:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The code includes the entire `bits/stdc++.h` library, which is not only unnecessary but can also slow down the compilation process. We can remove this line and add the specific headers required for the code.

2. Avoid using the `vector` class for small sizes: The `parent` vector is used to store the parent of each node. Since the number of nodes is known at compile time, we can replace the `vector` with a fixed-size array, which can lead to faster and more memory-efficient code.

3. Optimize the `find_set` function: The current implementation of the `find_set` function uses recursion, which can be slow and might lead to stack overflow for large inputs. We can optimize this function by implementing path compression, which flattens the tree structure and reduces the height of each node. This can be achieved by assigning the parent directly to the root of the set during the find operation.

4. Optimize the `union_sets` function: The current implementation of the `union_sets` function unions two sets by always assigning one set's parent to the other. This can lead to unbalanced trees, resulting in longer find operations. We can optimize this function by using the union-by-rank technique, which assigns the parent based on the rank (i.e., the height) of each set.

5. Avoid unnecessary checks in the main loop: The main loop iterates over all nodes and checks if the current node is the root of its set. However, we can optimize this loop by iterating only over the roots of the sets, as they uniquely represent each set.

6. Optimize input/output operations: The code uses `cin` and `cout` for input and output operations, respectively. These operations can be slow, especially when dealing with large inputs or outputs. We can optimize this by disabling the synchronization between C and C++ input/output operations using `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false)`. Additionally, we can use newline character '\n' instead of `endl` for faster output.

Based on these observations, let's proceed with the optimization steps.
