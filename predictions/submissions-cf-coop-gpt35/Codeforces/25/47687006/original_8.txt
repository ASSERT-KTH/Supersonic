The given code is an implementation of a disjoint-set data structure. It takes an input of roads connecting cities and identifies the useless roads, i.e., the roads that can be removed without disconnecting any cities. The code uses the union-find algorithm to perform this task.

Upon analyzing the code, the following potential optimizations can be made:

1. Use a smaller data type for variables: The variables `n`, `hb`, and `currURoad` can be changed to a smaller data type (e.g., `int16_t` or `uint8_t`) if the input size is small. This will reduce memory usage.

2. Avoid unnecessary `pair` creation: The `uselessRoads` vector stores pairs of integers representing the useless roads. However, since the roads are stored as pairs in the input as well, we can directly store the indices of the useless roads instead of creating pairs. This will reduce memory usage and eliminate the need for converting indices to pairs later.

3. Avoid unnecessary copying of pairs: In the `union_sets` function, the `push_back` operation is used to add useless roads to the `uselessRoads` vector. However, this operation involves copying the pair, which can be avoided by using `emplace_back` instead.

4. Use reserve for vector resizing: The `parent` vector is resized in the `main` function, but the final size is known in advance. Using `reserve` instead of `resize` will avoid unnecessary reallocation and copying of elements.

5. Optimize the find_set function: The current implementation of `find_set` uses recursive calls, which can lead to stack overflow for large values of `n`. By using path compression, we can optimize the function to reduce the number of recursive calls and improve its running time.

6. Optimize the union_sets function: The current implementation of `union_sets` uses two `find_set` calls, which can be reduced to one by directly assigning `parent[bb] = aa` instead of using `find_set` for `bb`.

7. Disable synchronization with standard I/O: The code uses `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0)` to synchronize C++ streams with C standard I/O. However, this synchronization can incur a runtime penalty. Since the code does not mix C and C++ I/O operations, this synchronization can be disabled to improve performance.

Based on these optimizations, the following is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

vector<int> parent;
vector<int> uselessRoads;
int16_t n, hb, currURoad;

int16_t find_set(int16_t ii) {
  if (ii == parent[ii])
    return ii;
  return parent[ii] = find_set(parent[ii]);
}

void union_sets(int16_t a, int16_t b) {
  int16_t aa = find_set(a);
  int16_t bb = find_set(b);
  if (aa != bb)
    parent[bb] = aa;
  else
    uselessRoads.emplace_back(a);
}

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);

#ifdef fileIO
  freopen("input.txt", "r", stdin);
  freopen("output.txt", "w", stdout);
#endif

  cin >> n;
  parent.reserve(n);
  for (int16_t i = 0; i < n; i++)
    parent.emplace_back(i);

  for (int16_t i = 1; i < n; i++) {
    int16_t rd1, rd2;
    cin >> rd1 >> rd2;
    union_sets(rd1 - 1, rd2 - 1);
  }

  cout << uselessRoads.size() << '\n';
  
  hb = -1;
  for (int16_t i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    if (parent[i] == i) {
      if (hb == -1)
        hb = i;
      else {
        cout << uselessRoads[currURoad] + 1 << ' ' << i + 1 << ' ' << hb + 1 << ' '
             << i + 1 << '\n';
        currURoad++;
      }
    }
  }

  return 0;
}
```

These optimizations aim to reduce memory usage, eliminate unnecessary operations, and improve the running time of the program. However, it's important to note that the actual performance gain will depend on the input size and the specific characteristics of the input data.
