The provided code is a C++ program that reads an integer `n` from the user and finds the smallest number greater than or equal to `n` that is divisible by all its digits. The program uses a brute force approach, starting from `n` and incrementing it by 1 until it finds a number that satisfies the condition.

To optimize this program, we can focus on the following aspects:

1. Avoid unnecessary string operations: The `check` function converts the input number `n` to a string and iterates over each digit to check if it divides `n`. This operation is not efficient and can be avoided.

2. Improve the divisibility check: The `check` function checks if each digit divides `n` individually. Instead, we can optimize this by checking if the number itself divides `n`.

3. Avoid unnecessary output statements: The `deb` and `deb2` statements are used for debugging and can be removed in the optimized version.

4. Use `cin` and `cout` instead of `scanf` and `printf`: The use of `scanf` and `printf` can be slower than `cin` and `cout` since they involve additional format parsing.

5. Remove unnecessary header files: The `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` includes a large number of header files, many of which are not needed for this program. It is recommended to include only the necessary header files.

Now, let's proceed with the step-by-step explanation of the optimization process.
