Code Analysis:
1. The code includes unnecessary and potentially inefficient header inclusion (`<bits/stdc++.h>`).
2. The code uses macros for common operations like for loop, input/output, etc. Macros can lead to code bloat and can be error-prone.
3. The code uses unnecessary data type aliases (`typedef`) for common types like `pii`, `pl`, etc.
4. The `check` function converts the number `n` to a string for each iteration, which is inefficient.
5. The `check` function checks if a number is divisible by all its digits. This can be optimized by checking divisibility in a single loop and avoiding unnecessary iterations.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Remove unnecessary and potentially inefficient header inclusion.
2. Replace macros with inline functions or use the standard library equivalents.
3. Remove unnecessary data type aliases.
4. Optimize the `check` function to avoid converting the number to a string and optimize the divisibility check.
5. Use more efficient algorithms or techniques to find the next divisible number.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Remove unnecessary and potentially inefficient header inclusion:
   - Remove the line `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` as it includes a large number of standard library headers, which can be unnecessary and lead to slower compilation times.

2. Replace macros with inline functions or use the standard library equivalents:
   - Replace the macro `fo(i, n)` with an inline function `for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)` to avoid code bloat and potential issues with macros.
   - Replace the macros `si(x)`, `sl(x)`, `ss(s)`, `sd(n)`, `sf(n)`, `pnl`, `deb(x)`, `deb2(x, y)`, `pb`, `mp`, `F`, `S`, `tr(it, a)`, `fast`, `endl`, `end_routine()` with their standard library equivalents or remove them if not necessary.

3. Remove unnecessary data type aliases:
   - Remove the `typedef` statements for `pii`, `pl`, etc., as they are not necessary and can make the code harder to understand.

4. Optimize the `check` function:
   - Instead of converting the number `n` to a string, we can use integer division and modulus to extract the digits.
   - Combine the divisibility check and digit extraction in a single loop.
   - Use an early exit strategy by setting the flag to `false` as soon as a digit is found that does not divide the number.
   - Remove the unnecessary `fo(i, s.length())` loop.

5. Use more efficient algorithms or techniques to find the next divisible number:
   - Instead of incrementing the number by 1 until a divisible number is found, we can use a more efficient algorithm to find the next divisible number.
   - We can increment the number by the smallest factor that is not yet checked. This can be done by finding the smallest prime factor of the number and incrementing by that factor.

Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

bool check(ll n) {
  std::vector<int> digits;
  ll temp = n;
  while (temp > 0) {
    digits.push_back(temp % 10);
    temp /= 10;
  }
  for (int i = 0; i < digits.size(); i++) {
    if (digits[i] == 0)
      continue;
    if (n % digits[i] != 0) {
      return false;
    }
  }
  return true;
}

void solve() {
  ll n;
  std::cin >> n;
  while (!check(n)) {
    int smallestFactor = 2;
    while (n % smallestFactor != 0) {
      smallestFactor++;
    }
    n += smallestFactor;
  }
  std::cout << n << std::endl;
}

int main() {
  int t = 1;
  std::cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    solve();
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Note: This optimized code assumes that the required headers have been included properly. Also, the optimized code does not include the unnecessary macros, unnecessary data type aliases, and unnecessary I/O statements for brevity.
