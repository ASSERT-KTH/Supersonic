Code Analysis:
1. The code reads two integers, `n` and `m`, from the input.
2. It then reads `m` integers into the array `a`.
3. The array `a` is sorted in ascending order.
4. The code contains two nested loops. The outer loop iterates from 1 to `m`, and the inner loop iterates from 0 to `a[i] - 1`.
5. Inside the inner loop, the code checks if `k` is greater than 0. If it is, it adds `a[i] - j` to `sum` and decrements `k`.
6. After the loops, another loop iterates from 1 to `n`. Inside this loop, it finds the maximum element of `a` and adds it to `sum1`, then decrements that element.
7. Finally, the code prints the values of `sum1` and `sum`.

Potential Performance Bottlenecks:
1. The code uses the `bits/stdc++.h` header, which includes all standard library headers. This can increase compilation time and may include unnecessary headers.
2. The code uses `scanf` and `printf` for input and output, respectively. These functions are slower than their C++ counterparts, `std::cin` and `std::cout`.
3. The code sorts the array `a` using the `std::sort` function. Sorting the entire array may be unnecessary, as we are only interested in finding the maximum element in each iteration.
4. The first nested loop has a time complexity of O(m*a_max), where `a_max` is the maximum value in `a`. This can be time-consuming if `a_max` is large.
5. The second loop iterates `n` times and uses the `std::max_element` function to find the maximum element in `a` in each iteration. This can be optimized to avoid unnecessary iterations and function calls.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Replace the `bits/stdc++.h` header with the necessary standard library headers.
2. Replace the `scanf` and `printf` functions with their C++ counterparts, `std::cin` and `std::cout`.
3. Optimize the sorting step by finding the maximum element in each iteration and swapping it with the last element of the unsorted portion of the array.
4. Replace the first nested loop with a single loop that calculates `sum` and updates `k` in a more efficient way.
5. Optimize the second loop by finding the maximum element in `a` only once and decrementing it in each iteration.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Replace the `bits/stdc++.h` header with the necessary standard library headers:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>
```

2. Replace the `scanf` and `printf` functions with their C++ counterparts, `std::cin` and `std::cout`:
```cpp
std::cin >> n >> m;
```

3. Optimize the sorting step by finding the maximum element in each iteration and swapping it with the last element of the unsorted portion of the array:
```cpp
for (int i = m; i >= 1; i--) {
    int maxIndex = i;
    for (int j = 1; j < i; j++) {
        if (a[j] > a[maxIndex]) {
            maxIndex = j;
        }
    }
    std::swap(a[maxIndex], a[i]);
}
```

4. Replace the first nested loop with a single loop that calculates `sum` and updates `k` in a more efficient way:
```cpp
for (int i = 1; i <= m; i++) {
    int j = a[i];
    j = std::min(j, k);
    sum += (j * (j + 1)) / 2;
    k -= j;
}
```

5. Optimize the second loop by finding the maximum element in `a` only once and decrementing it in each iteration:
```cpp
int maxIndex = std::max_element(a + 1, a + m + 1) - a;
for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    sum1 += a[maxIndex];
    a[maxIndex]--;
    maxIndex = (a[maxIndex] >= a[maxIndex + 1]) ? maxIndex : (maxIndex + 1);
}
```
