Code Analysis:
- The code reads two integers `n` and `m` from input.
- It then reads `m` integers and stores them in an array `a`.
- The array `a` is then sorted in non-decreasing order.
- Two nested loops are used to calculate the sum of the largest `n` elements in the array `a`, and the sum of all elements in the array `a` minus their indices.
- The results are then printed.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Avoid unnecessary includes: The line `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` includes a large number of libraries, which can slow down compilation. We can replace it with only the necessary includes, such as `#include <cstdio>` for `printf` and `scanf`, and `#include <algorithm>` for `sort` and `max_element`.

2. Avoid unnecessary memory usage: The array `a` is declared with a fixed size of 1020 elements, but it is only used up to index `m`. We can reduce the size of the array to `m` to save memory.

3. Use a more efficient sorting algorithm: The current code uses the `sort` function from the `<algorithm>` library, which has a time complexity of O(n log n). Since we only need to sort `m` elements, we can use a more efficient sorting algorithm, such as counting sort or radix sort, which have a time complexity of O(m).

4. Optimize the calculation of `sum` using mathematical formulas: The inner loop can be replaced with a mathematical formula to calculate the sum of arithmetic series. This will eliminate the need for the inner loop and reduce the number of iterations.

5. Optimize the calculation of `sum1` using a priority queue: The current code uses the `max_element` function to find the maximum element in the array `a`, which has a time complexity of O(m). We can optimize this by using a priority queue (e.g., `std::priority_queue`) to keep track of the largest `n` elements in `a`. This will reduce the time complexity to O(m log n).

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Remove unnecessary includes and replace them with the necessary ones:
```cpp
#include <cstdio>
#include <algorithm>
```

2. Reduce the size of the array `a` to `m`:
```cpp
int a[m];
```

3. Replace the `sort` function with a more efficient sorting algorithm such as counting sort or radix sort. Here, we will use counting sort:
```cpp
int count[1001] = {0}; // Count array to store the count of each element
for (int i = 1; i <= m; i++) {
  scanf("%d", &a[i]);
  count[a[i]]++; // Increment the count of the corresponding element
}
int index = 1;
for (int i = 1; i <= 1000; i++) {
  while (count[i] > 0) {
    a[index++] = i; // Reconstruct the sorted array
    count[i]--;
  }
}
```

4. Replace the inner loop in the first loop with a mathematical formula to calculate the sum of arithmetic series:
```cpp
for (int i = 1; i <= m; i++) {
  int diff = a[i] - 0; // Calculate the difference between the current element and 0
  int num = min(k, diff); // Take the minimum of k and diff
  sum += (num * (2 * a[i] - num + 1)) / 2; // Use the arithmetic series formula
  k -= num;
}
```

5. Use a priority queue (e.g., `std::priority_queue`) to optimize the calculation of `sum1`:
```cpp
std::priority_queue<int> pq(a + 1, a + m + 1); // Create a priority queue with elements from a
for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
  int max_element = pq.top(); // Get the largest element
  pq.pop(); // Remove the largest element
  sum1 += max_element; // Add the largest element to sum1
  pq.push(max_element - 1); // Decrement the largest element and insert it back into the priority queue
}
```

6. Print the results:
```cpp
printf("%d %d\n", sum1, sum);
```

Optimized Code:
```cpp
#include <cstdio>
#include <algorithm>
#include <queue>

int main() {
  int n, m, sum = 0, sum1 = 0, k;
  scanf("%d%d", &n, &m);
  k = n;
  int a[m];
  int count[1001] = {0};
  for (int i = 1; i <= m; i++) {
    scanf("%d", &a[i]);
    count[a[i]]++;
  }
  int index = 1;
  for (int i = 1; i <= 1000; i++) {
    while (count[i] > 0) {
      a[index++] = i;
      count[i]--;
    }
  }
  for (int i = 1; i <= m; i++) {
    int diff = a[i] - 0;
    int num = std::min(k, diff);
    sum += (num * (2 * a[i] - num + 1)) / 2;
    k -= num;
  }
  std::priority_queue<int> pq(a + 1, a + m + 1);
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    int max_element = pq.top();
    pq.pop();
    sum1 += max_element;
    pq.push(max_element - 1);
  }
  printf("%d %d\n", sum1, sum);
  return 0;
}
```

The optimized code preserves the functionality and output of the original code while improving performance by reducing memory usage and optimizing the sorting and calculation algorithms. It also uses a priority queue to optimize the calculation of `sum1`.
