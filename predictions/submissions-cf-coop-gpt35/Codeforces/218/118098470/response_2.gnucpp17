The provided code calculates two sums, `sum` and `sum1`, based on the input values `n` and `m`. The `sum` is calculated by iterating over the sorted array `a` and adding the difference between each element and the loop variable `j`. The `sum1` is calculated by repeatedly finding the maximum element in `a`, adding it to `sum1`, and decrementing it.

To optimize this code, we can focus on the following areas:

1. Sorting the array `a` is unnecessary since we only need to find the maximum element repeatedly. Sorting can be an expensive operation with a time complexity of O(m log m). We can eliminate the sorting step and find the maximum element directly.

2. The nested loop that calculates `sum` can be optimized. Instead of iterating `j` from 0 to `a[i]`, we can calculate the sum using a mathematical formula. The sum of numbers from 1 to `a[i]` can be calculated as `(a[i] * (a[i] + 1)) / 2`. This formula allows us to compute the sum in constant time, avoiding the need for a nested loop.

3. The second loop that calculates `sum1` can also be optimized. Instead of finding the maximum element repeatedly using `max_element`, we can keep track of the maximum element when reading the input and update it when necessary.

4. We can consider using compiler optimizations and pragma directives to hint the compiler to optimize certain parts of the code.
