The provided code aims to solve a problem where there are 'n' people and 'm' tasks. Each task has a certain number of points assigned to it. The goal is to distribute the tasks among the people in such a way that the total points earned by the people are maximized. 

However, the code could benefit from several optimizations. Let's go through each step one by one.

1. Code Analysis:
   - The code uses an array `a` to store the points for each task. It performs a sort operation on this array, which has a time complexity of O(m*log(m)).
   - The first loop calculates the sum of points earned based on the number of tasks completed by each person. This loop has a time complexity of O(n*m).
   - The second loop finds the task with the maximum points, subtracts one point from it, and adds it to the total sum. This loop has a time complexity of O(n*m).
   - Overall, the time complexity of the code is O(n*m*log(m)).

2. Optimization Strategy:
   - Replace the use of `std::sort` with a more optimized sorting algorithm.
   - Optimize the calculation of the sum of points earned by each person.
   - Optimize the loop that finds the task with the maximum points.

3. Step-by-Step Explanation:
   1. Sorting Optimization:
      - The code uses `std::sort` to sort the array `a`. However, we can use a counting sort algorithm instead, which has a time complexity of O(m).
      - Counting sort works by counting the frequency of each element in the array, and then reconstructing the sorted array based on these frequencies.
      - Since the array `a` has a fixed range of values (up to 1020), counting sort can be used to sort it efficiently.

   2. Calculation of Points Optimization:
      - The first loop calculates the sum of points earned by each person based on the number of tasks completed.
      - Instead of iterating over all tasks for each person, we can optimize this calculation by using a cumulative sum approach.
      - We can calculate the cumulative sum of points for each task and store it in a separate array. Then, for each person, we can directly access the cumulative sum corresponding to the number of tasks completed by that person.
      - This approach reduces the time complexity of this calculation to O(m).

   3. Task Selection Optimization:
      - The second loop finds the task with the maximum points, subtracts one point from it, and adds it to the total sum.
      - Instead of repeatedly finding the maximum element in the array `a`, we can maintain a separate variable to track the current task with the maximum points.
      - We can update this variable whenever a task with more points is encountered, and directly subtract one point from it.
      - This optimization reduces the time complexity of this loop to O(n).
