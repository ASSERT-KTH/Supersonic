The given code calculates the sum of the maximum elements in an array `a` and the sum of the differences between the maximum element and each element in the array. The code reads two integers `n` and `m`, followed by an array `a` of `m` integers. It then sorts the array `a`, calculates the two sums, and outputs the results.

Upon analyzing the code, we can identify a few potential performance bottlenecks and inefficient memory usage:

1. Inefficient sorting: The code uses the `sort` function from the C++ standard library to sort the array `a`. This function utilizes a comparison-based sorting algorithm, which has a time complexity of O(m*log(m)). However, we can optimize this sorting step by using a counting sort algorithm since the array elements are integers in a limited range.

2. Redundant calculations: The code calculates the sum of the differences between the maximum element and each element in the array using nested loops. This can be optimized by calculating the difference once and then multiplying it by the number of remaining elements to be processed.

3. Memory usage: The code uses an array `a` to store the input integers. However, the size of the array is fixed at 1020 elements, which may be larger than necessary and can consume excessive memory.

Based on these observations, we can formulate the following optimization strategy:

1. Replace the sorting step with a counting sort algorithm to improve efficiency.
2. Optimize the calculation of the sum of differences by calculating the difference once and multiplying it by the number of remaining elements to be processed.
3. Reduce the size of the array `a` to the minimum required size.
4. Consider compiler optimizations, such as loop unrolling or pragma directives, to further enhance performance.
