Code Analysis:
- The code reads an integer `n` followed by another integer `m`.
- It then creates a map `mp` to store key-value pairs where the key is a string and the value is also a string.
- It creates a vector `v` of strings of size `m`.
- It then reads `m` pairs of strings into `x` and `y`. It checks the length of `x` and assigns either `x` or `y` to `mp[x]` depending on the length comparison.
- It assigns `x` to `v[i]` for each iteration of the loop.
- It then reads `n` strings into `z`.
- It iterates over the vector `v` and checks if `z` is equal to any element in `v`. If a match is found, it prints the corresponding value in `mp` followed by a space.
- The program ends.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Use `unordered_map` instead of `map`: Since the order of the elements does not matter in this case, we can use `unordered_map` which has a faster average lookup time compared to `map`.
2. Use `reserve` for vector `v`: Since the size of `v` is known in advance, we can use `reserve` to allocate the required memory upfront instead of resizing it dynamically.
3. Use references for loop variables: To avoid unnecessary copying, we can use references in the for-each loop to iterate over `v`.
4. Use `find` instead of a for-each loop: Instead of iterating over `v` and checking for equality, we can use the `find` function of `unordered_map` to directly find the value corresponding to `z`.
5. Move `z` inside the loop: To reduce memory usage, we can move the declaration of `z` inside the loop as it is not needed outside.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Replace `map<string, string>` with `unordered_map<string, string>` to use an unordered map which has faster average lookup time.
2. Add `v.reserve(m)` before the loop to allocate memory for `v` in advance, avoiding dynamic resizing.
3. Change the for-each loop to use references: `for (const auto& x : v)`.
4. Replace the for-each loop with `auto it = mp.find(z)` and check if `it != mp.end()` to find the value corresponding to `z` in the unordered map.
5. Move the declaration of `string z` inside the loop to reduce memory usage.

Optimized Code:
```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int n, m;
  cin >> n >> m;
  unordered_map<string, string> mp;
  vector<string> v;
  v.reserve(m);
  
  for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
    string x, y;
    cin >> x >> y;
    mp[x] = (x.length() <= y.length()) ? x : y;
    v.push_back(x);
  }
  
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    string z;
    cin >> z;
    auto it = mp.find(z);
    if (it != mp.end()) {
      cout << it->second << " ";
    }
  }
  
  return 0;
}
```
The optimized code retains the functionality and output of the original code while improving performance and reducing memory usage.
