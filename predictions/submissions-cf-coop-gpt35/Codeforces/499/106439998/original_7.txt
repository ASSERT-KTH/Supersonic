The given code reads a number `n` and a number `m` from the input, followed by `m` pairs of strings. It then reads `n` strings and checks if each string is present in the vector `v`. If a match is found, it prints the corresponding value from the `mp` map.

Here are a few potential optimizations that can be applied to improve the performance and memory usage of the code:

1. Avoid using `bits/stdc++.h`: The `bits/stdc++.h` header is not a standard C++ header and its usage is discouraged. It includes a large number of unnecessary headers, which can slow down the compilation process. Instead, include only the required headers (`iostream`, `map`, and `vector` in this case).

2. Use `std::unordered_map` instead of `std::map`: The `std::unordered_map` provides constant-time average complexity for insertion, search, and deletion operations, while `std::map` has logarithmic complexity. Since the order of elements is not required in this program, using `std::unordered_map` can improve performance.

3. Avoid unnecessary copies: In the current code, when inserting a key-value pair into the `mp` map, it creates a copy of the string `x` or `y`. Instead, we can use `std::move` to move the string into the map, avoiding the unnecessary copy.

4. Remove the `continue` statement: In the inner loop, the `continue` statement is not needed because there are no statements after it. Removing it will make the code cleaner and easier to read.

5. Use `std::unordered_set` instead of `std::vector` for `v`: Since the order of elements in `v` is not important, using an `std::unordered_set` instead of an `std::vector` can improve the performance of searching for elements.

6. Use `const auto&` instead of `auto` in the range-based loop: In the inner loop, using `const auto&` instead of `auto` allows the loop to operate on a const reference to the element, avoiding unnecessary copying.

7. Reserve space for `v` and `mp`: Since the size of `v` and `mp` is known in advance, we can reserve space for them to avoid unnecessary reallocations during insertion.

Here is the optimized code incorporating the above optimizations:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <unordered_set>
#include <string>
#include <vector>

int main() {
  int n, m;
  std::cin >> n >> m;

  std::unordered_map<std::string, std::string> mp;
  mp.reserve(m); // Reserve space for m elements

  std::unordered_set<std::string> v;
  v.reserve(m); // Reserve space for m elements

  for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
    std::string x, y;
    std::cin >> x >> y;
    mp[x] = (x.length() <= y.length()) ? std::move(x) : std::move(y);
    v.insert(x);
  }

  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    std::string z;
    std::cin >> z;
    for (const auto& x : v) {
      if (z == x) {
        std::cout << mp[x] << " ";
        break;
      }
    }
  }

  return 0;
}
```

With these optimizations, the code should run faster and use less memory compared to the original implementation.
