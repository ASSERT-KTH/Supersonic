The given code reads an integer `n` followed by another integer `m`, and then reads `m` pairs of strings `x` and `y`. The code creates a map `mp` where for each pair `x` and `y`, it maps `x` to itself if `x` is shorter or equal in length to `y`, otherwise it maps `x` to `y`. Then, the code reads `n` strings `z` and for each string, it checks if it exists in the vector `v`. If it does, it prints the corresponding value from the map `mp`.

Here is an optimization strategy to improve the performance and memory usage of the given code:

1. Avoid using `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`. Instead, include only the necessary standard libraries. In this case, we only need `iostream`, `string`, `map`, and `vector`.

2. Initialize the vector `v` with a size of `m` to avoid unnecessary reallocation during the loop.

3. Instead of using a map, which has a worst-case time complexity of O(log(n)) for insertion and retrieval, use an unordered_map. The unordered_map has an average time complexity of O(1) for insertion and retrieval, which is more efficient for this problem.

4. Use the move constructor when assigning strings to the vector `v` to avoid unnecessary copying.

5. Avoid using the range-based for loop for iterating over the vector `v`. Instead, use the traditional for loop with an index variable. This will avoid creating an iterator object for each iteration, which can improve performance.

6. Use the `find` function of the unordered_map to check if a string exists in the map. This avoids unnecessary comparisons in the loop.

7. Use `cout` with the `<<` operator instead of `printf` for output to take advantage of C++ stream buffering.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <vector>

int main() {
  int n, m;
  std::cin >> n >> m;

  std::unordered_map<std::string, std::string> mp;
  std::vector<std::string> v(m);

  for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
    std::string x, y;
    std::cin >> x >> y;

    mp[x] = (x.length() <= y.length()) ? x : y;
    v[i] = std::move(x);
  }

  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    std::string z;
    std::cin >> z;

    auto it = mp.find(z);
    if (it != mp.end()) {
      std::cout << it->second << " ";
    }
  }

  return 0;
}
```

By following this optimization strategy, we have minimized unnecessary copying and improved the runtime efficiency of the code. The trade-off is that the optimized code might be slightly more complex due to the additional use of move semantics and the unordered_map, but the performance gain justifies it.
