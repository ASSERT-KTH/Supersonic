The given code reads two integers `n` and `m` from the input, then reads `m` pairs of strings and stores them in a map `mp` and a vector `v`. Finally, it reads `n` strings from the input and prints the corresponding value from the map `mp` if it exists in the vector `v`.

Here are some potential optimizations for this code:

1. Use `unordered_map` instead of `map`: The code currently uses a `map` to store the key-value pairs. However, for this problem, there is no need to maintain the order of the keys. Using an `unordered_map` will provide faster average lookup time compared to a `map`.

2. Avoid unnecessary string copy: The code copies the string `x` to `mp[x]` and `v[i]` using the assignment operator. This can be avoided by using the `emplace` function for insertion in the map and `push_back` for insertion in the vector.

3. Use `reserve` for vector: Since the size of the vector `v` is known in advance (`m`), we can use the `reserve` function to allocate memory for `m` elements. This will avoid unnecessary reallocations and improve performance.

4. Use `const auto&` for loop variable: The loop `for (auto x : v)` currently makes a copy of each string in `v`. Using `const auto& x` will avoid unnecessary copies and improve performance.

Here's the optimized code with the above optimizations:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int n, m;
  cin >> n >> m;

  unordered_map<string, string> mp;
  vector<string> v;
  v.reserve(m);

  for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
    string x, y;
    cin >> x >> y;
    mp.emplace(x, (x.length() <= y.length()) ? x : y);
    v.push_back(move(x));
  }

  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    string z;
    cin >> z;
    for (const auto& x : v) {
      if (z == x) {
        cout << mp[x] << " ";
        break;
      }
    }
  }

  return 0;
}
```

These optimizations improve the performance and memory usage of the original code by using more efficient data structures, avoiding unnecessary copies, and reserving memory in advance. The optimized code is also easier to understand and maintain.
