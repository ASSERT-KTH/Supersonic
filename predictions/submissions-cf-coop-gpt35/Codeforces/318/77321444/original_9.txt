Code Analysis:

1. The code includes unnecessary header files like `<bits/stdc++.h>`, which can slow down the compilation process. It is recommended to include only the necessary header files.

2. The `#define` statements for `FAST`, `vl`, `pb`, `mp`, `all`, and `int` are not used in the code and can be removed.

3. The code uses a loop to iterate `t` times, but `t` is always assigned the value 1. This loop is unnecessary and can be removed.

4. The code uses bitwise operator `&` to check if `n` is odd. This operation is not necessary and can be replaced with the modulo operator `%`.

5. The code uses multiple `if-else` conditions to calculate the result based on the values of `n` and `k`. These conditions can be simplified.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Remove unnecessary header files and unused `#define` statements to improve compilation time and reduce memory usage.

2. Replace the bitwise operator `&` with the modulo operator `%` to check if `n` is odd.

3. Simplify the `if-else` conditions to reduce the number of comparisons and improve readability.

Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. Remove unnecessary header files and unused `#define` statements:
   - Remove the line `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`.
   - Remove the `#define` statements for `vl`, `pb`, `mp`, `all`, and `int`.

2. Replace the bitwise operator `&` with the modulo operator `%`:
   - Replace the condition `if (n & 1)` with `if (n % 2 == 1)`.

3. Simplify the `if-else` conditions:
   - Combine the conditions `if (n & 1)` and `if (k <= (n / 2) + 1)` into a single condition `if (k <= (n + 1) / 2)`.
   - Combine the conditions `if (n & 1)` and `if (k <= n / 2)` into a single condition `if (k <= n / 2)`.

Optimized Code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(NULL);
    cout.tie(NULL);
    
    int n, k;
    cin >> n >> k;

    if (k <= (n + 1) / 2) {
        cout << 2 * k - 1 << endl;
    } else {
        cout << 2 * (k - n / 2) << endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

This optimized code removes unnecessary header files and unused `#define` statements, replaces the bitwise operator `&` with the modulo operator `%`, and simplifies the `if-else` conditions. The changes improve code readability and potentially reduce memory usage.
