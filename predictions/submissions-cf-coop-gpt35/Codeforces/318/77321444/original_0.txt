Code Analysis:
1. The code includes unnecessary header files `<bits/stdc++.h>` and `using namespace std`. These can be removed to improve compilation time and reduce namespace pollution.
2. Macros like `FAST`, `vl`, `pb`, `mp`, `all`, and `int` are defined but not used in the code. They can be removed to simplify the code.
3. The variable `i` and `j` are declared but not used. They can be removed.
4. The `main` function has a redundant check `while (t--)` where `t` is always 1. This can be simplified to a single iteration.
5. The code uses `endl` to print a newline character. Using `'\n'` is more efficient.
6. The code checks if `n` is odd or even multiple times. This check can be simplified and moved outside the loop.
7. Multiplication and subtraction operations are repeated multiple times. These can be reduced to improve performance.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Remove unnecessary header files and macros.
2. Simplify and optimize the logic for calculating the result based on the values of `n` and `k`.
3. Use a single `cout` statement outside the loop instead of multiple `cout` statements inside the loop.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Remove unnecessary header files and macros:
   - Remove `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` and `using namespace std` as they are not required.
   - Remove unused macros `FAST`, `vl`, `pb`, `mp`, `all`, and `int`.
   - Remove unused variables `i` and `j`.

2. Simplify and optimize the logic for calculating the result:
   - Move the check for odd or even `n` outside the loop.
   - Simplify the logic for calculating the result based on the values of `n` and `k`.
   - Use a single `cout` statement outside the loop instead of multiple `cout` statements inside the loop.

3. Use `'\n'` instead of `endl` to improve efficiency.

Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(nullptr);
    cout.tie(nullptr);

    int n, k;
    cin >> n >> k;

    int result;
    if (n % 2 == 0) {
        if (k <= n / 2) {
            result = 2 * k - 1;
        } else {
            result = 2 * (k - n / 2);
        }
    } else {
        if (k <= (n / 2) + 1) {
            result = 2 * k - 1;
        } else {
            result = 2 * (k - n / 2 - 1);
        }
    }

    cout << result << '\n';

    return 0;
}
```

The code has been optimized by removing unnecessary header files, macros, and variables. The logic for calculating the result has been simplified and optimized. A single `cout` statement is used outside the loop. The code now uses `'\n'` instead of `endl` for better efficiency.
