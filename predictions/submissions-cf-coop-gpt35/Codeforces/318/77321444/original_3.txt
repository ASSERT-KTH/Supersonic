Code Analysis:
- The code reads an integer `t` to determine the number of test cases.
- For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`.
- The code then performs some calculations based on the values of `n` and `k` and prints the result.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Remove unnecessary includes: The code includes `bits/stdc++.h`, which is a very large header and slows down the compilation process. We can remove this include and only include the necessary headers.
2. Remove unnecessary macros: The code defines several macros that are not used or not necessary. We can remove these macros to simplify the code.
3. Use a more efficient data structure: The code uses a vector to store long long integers. However, since we only need to store a single value, we can use a simple long long variable instead of a vector.
4. Simplify the calculations: The code contains several if-else statements to perform the calculations. We can simplify these calculations to make the code more efficient.
5. Remove unnecessary I/O operations: The code includes freopen statements to redirect input and output to files. These statements are not necessary for the optimization task and can be removed.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Remove unnecessary includes:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
```
2. Remove unnecessary macros:
```cpp
// Remove the macros
```
3. Use a more efficient data structure:
```cpp
// Replace vector<long long> with a long long variable
long long n, k;
```
4. Simplify the calculations:
```cpp
// Simplify the calculations
if (n & 1) {
  cout << 2 * k - (k <= (n / 2) + 1) << endl;
} else {
  cout << 2 * k - (k <= n / 2) << endl;
}
```
5. Remove unnecessary I/O operations:
```cpp
// Remove the freopen statements
```

Optimized Code Block:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0);
  cin.tie(0);
  cout.tie(0);

  int t = 1;
  while (t--) {
    long long n, k;
    cin >> n >> k;
    if (n & 1) {
      cout << 2 * k - (k <= (n / 2) + 1) << endl;
    } else {
      cout << 2 * k - (k <= n / 2) << endl;
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```
