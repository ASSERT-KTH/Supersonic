The provided code calculates the value of an expression based on the values of two input variables `n` and `k`. The code uses a series of conditional statements to determine the result based on the values of `n` and `k`. 

Upon analyzing the code, the following potential performance bottlenecks and optimization opportunities can be identified:

1. Unnecessary includes: The code includes the entire standard library (`<bits/stdc++.h>`), which can lead to slower compilation times. It is recommended to include only the necessary headers.

2. Redundant variable definitions: The code defines two global variables `i` and `j`, which are not used. These definitions can be removed to improve code readability.

3. Redundant macros: The macros `vl`, `pb`, `mp`, and `all` are defined but not used in the code. These macros can be removed to simplify the code.

4. Redundant use of `int` keyword: The code redefines `int` as `long long`, which is unnecessary since `int` is not used anywhere in the code. This redefinition can be removed.

5. Redundant loop: The code uses a `while` loop with `t--` as the exit condition, but `t` is always equal to 1. This loop is unnecessary and can be removed.

6. Redundant file I/O operations: The code includes file I/O operations (`freopen`) that are not used in the given code block. These operations can be removed.

7. Redundant parentheses: The code uses unnecessary parentheses in the conditional statements. These parentheses can be removed to improve code readability.

8. Redundant multiplication: The code contains multiple instances of `2 * x`, where `x` is a variable. This multiplication can be simplified by using bit shifting (`x << 1`) which is faster than multiplication.

9. Avoiding division: The code uses division operations (`n/2`) multiple times, which can be computationally expensive. It is recommended to avoid division operations and use bit shifting (`n >> 1`) instead, which is faster.

Based on these analysis points, the following optimization steps can be proposed:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: Replace the line `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` with the necessary headers, such as `#include <iostream>`.

2. Remove redundant variable definitions: Remove the global variable definitions `int i, j;` as they are not used in the code.

3. Remove redundant macros: Remove the macros `vl`, `pb`, `mp`, and `all` as they are not used in the code.

4. Remove redundant `int` redefinition: Remove the line `#define int long long` as `int` is not used anywhere in the code.

5. Remove redundant loop: Remove the while loop with `t--` as the exit condition.

6. Remove redundant file I/O operations: Remove the lines `freopen("input.txt", "r", stdin);` and `freopen("output.txt", "w", stdout);` as they are not used in the code.

7. Remove redundant parentheses: Remove unnecessary parentheses in the conditional statements to improve code readability.

8. Simplify multiplication: Replace instances of `2 * x` with `x << 1` to simplify the multiplication operation.

9. Avoid division: Replace division operations (`n/2`) with bit shifting (`n >> 1`) to avoid division and improve performance.

10. Comment the changes made to the code to make it easily understandable.
