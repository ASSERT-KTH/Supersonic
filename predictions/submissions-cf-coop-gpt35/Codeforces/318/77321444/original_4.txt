Analysis:
- The code reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input.
- It then calculates the result based on the values of `n` and `k` and prints it.
- The code is using a vector and some macros that are not necessary for this particular problem.
- The code is correct and functional, but there are some potential areas for optimization.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Remove unnecessary macros and headers:
   - The `bits/stdc++.h` header includes many unnecessary standard library headers. We can replace it with the specific headers that are actually used in the code (`iostream` and `vector`).
   - The `FAST` macro is not necessary for this particular problem, so we can remove it.
   - The `vl` macro is not used in the code, so we can remove it.
   - The `pb`, `mp`, and `all` macros are not used in the code, so we can remove them.
   - The `int` macro is defined twice, once as `int` and once as `long long`. We can remove the duplicate definition.
   - The `i` and `j` variables are declared but not used, so we can remove them.

2. Simplify the calculation logic:
   - The code contains multiple if-else statements to calculate the result based on the values of `n` and `k`. We can simplify this logic by using a single formula.
   - The formula is:
     - If `n` is odd, the result is `2 * k - 1` if `k` is less than or equal to `(n / 2) + 1`, and `2 * (k - n / 2 - 1)` otherwise.
     - If `n` is even, the result is `2 * k - 1` if `k` is less than or equal to `n / 2`, and `2 * (k - n / 2)` otherwise.

3. Optimize input and output operations:
   - The code uses `cin` and `cout` for input and output operations. These operations can be slow when reading or writing large amounts of data. We can use `scanf` and `printf` for faster input and output.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Remove unnecessary macros and headers:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;
```

2. Simplify the calculation logic:
```cpp
int main() {
  int t = 1;
  while (t--) {
    int n, k;
    scanf("%lld %lld", &n, &k);

    int result;
    if (n & 1) {
      result = (k <= (n / 2) + 1) ? 2 * k - 1 : 2 * (k - n / 2 - 1);
    } else {
      result = (k <= n / 2) ? 2 * k - 1 : 2 * (k - n / 2);
    }

    printf("%lld\n", result);
  }
  return 0;
}
```

3. Optimize input and output operations:
```cpp
int main() {
  int t = 1;
  while (t--) {
    int n, k;
    scanf("%lld %lld", &n, &k);

    int result;
    if (n & 1) {
      result = (k <= (n / 2) + 1) ? 2 * k - 1 : 2 * (k - n / 2 - 1);
    } else {
      result = (k <= n / 2) ? 2 * k - 1 : 2 * (k - n / 2);
    }

    printf("%lld\n", result);
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Optimized Code:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int t = 1;
  while (t--) {
    int n, k;
    scanf("%lld %lld", &n, &k);

    int result;
    if (n & 1) {
      result = (k <= (n / 2) + 1) ? 2 * k - 1 : 2 * (k - n / 2 - 1);
    } else {
      result = (k <= n / 2) ? 2 * k - 1 : 2 * (k - n / 2);
    }

    printf("%lld\n", result);
  }
  return 0;
}
```
