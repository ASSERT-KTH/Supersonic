The provided code calculates and outputs the value of an expression based on the input values of 'n' and 'k'. It uses a loop to repeat the calculation multiple times. 

Let's analyze the code and identify potential areas for optimization:

1. Unnecessary includes: The code includes the entire `bits/stdc++.h` header, which is not recommended as it includes all standard library headers and can lead to longer compilation times. We should only include the necessary standard library headers.

2. Macro usage: Macros like `FAST`, `vl`, `pb`, `mp`, and `all` are used to define shortcuts for certain operations. While they can make the code more concise, they can also make it harder to read and understand. We should consider removing unnecessary macros to improve code readability.

3. Redundant variables: The variables `i` and `j` are declared but not used anywhere in the code. We should remove these variables to eliminate unnecessary memory usage.

4. Loop optimization: The code uses a `while` loop that is executed only once (`t` is always 1). This loop can be removed as it serves no purpose.

5. Redundant calculations: The code repeats the calculation `2 * k - 1` multiple times. We can optimize this by calculating it only once and storing it in a variable.

6. Redundant conditions: The conditions inside the nested `if-else` statements can be simplified. We can combine the conditions to reduce the number of comparisons.

7. Redundant parentheses: Some parentheses in the code are unnecessary and can be removed to improve code readability.

8. Function calls: The code uses `cin` and `cout` for input and output. While convenient, these functions can be slower compared to other input/output methods. We can optimize the input/output operations using alternative methods like `scanf` and `printf`.

Based on the above analysis, we can propose the following optimization strategy:

1. Remove unnecessary includes and use specific standard library headers only.
2. Remove unnecessary macros to improve code readability.
3. Remove unused variables (`i` and `j`).
4. Remove the redundant `while` loop.
5. Calculate the expression `2 * k - 1` only once and store it in a variable.
6. Simplify the conditions inside the nested `if-else` statements.
7. Remove unnecessary parentheses to improve code readability.
8. Optimize input/output operations using `scanf` and `printf`.
