The provided code seems to solve a problem that involves querying a series of arrays for a specific property. However, there are several potential areas for optimization.

1. Inefficient memory usage: The code uses a dynamic array `int v[n]` to store the elements of each array. This can be inefficient, especially for large values of `n`. Instead, we can use a `vector<int>` which dynamically resizes itself as needed.

2. Redundant computation: The code uses `abs(v[j + 1] - v[j]) == 1` to check if two adjacent elements differ by 1. However, this computation is performed in every iteration of the loop, even if the condition has already been satisfied. We can optimize this by breaking out of the loop as soon as we find a pair of adjacent elements that differ by 1.

3. Loop optimization: The loop `for (int j = 0; j < n - 1; j++)` iterates over all elements of the array except the last one. We can optimize this by using `for (int j = 0; j < n - 1 && f == 1; j++)` and breaking out of the loop as soon as `f` is updated to 2.

4. Unnecessary header inclusion: The code includes the entire `bits/stdc++.h` header, which is not necessary and can slow down compilation. We can include only the necessary headers, such as `<iostream>` and `<algorithm>`.

To optimize the code, we can make the following changes:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

int main() {
  short q;
  std::cin >> q;
  for (short i = 0; i < q; i++) {
    short n, f = 1;
    std::cin >> n;
    std::vector<int> v(n);
    for (int j = 0; j < n; j++)
      std::cin >> v[j];
    std::sort(v.begin(), v.end());
    for (int j = 0; j < n - 1 && f == 1; j++) {
      if (v[j + 1] - v[j] == 1) {
        f = 2;
        break;
      }
    }
    std::cout << f << '\n';
  }
}
```

These optimizations improve the memory usage by using `vector<int>` instead of a dynamic array, optimize the loop by breaking out as soon as the condition is satisfied, and reduce unnecessary header inclusion. The code complexity is not significantly increased, and the performance gain should be noticeable, especially for large values of `n`.
