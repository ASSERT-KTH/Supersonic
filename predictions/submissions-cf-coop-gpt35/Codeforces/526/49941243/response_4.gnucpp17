The given code is a C++ program that reads an integer `n`, an integer `k`, and a string `s` of length `n`, and then performs some computations on the string `s`. The program calculates an array `f` using the Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm and then prints a series of characters based on the values in the array `f`.

Upon analyzing the code, the following potential performance bottlenecks and areas for optimization can be identified:

1. Inefficient Memory Usage: The array `s` of size `1000005` and the array `f` of size `1000005` are both declared as global variables. This can lead to inefficient memory usage, especially if the input strings are much smaller than the maximum size.

2. Redundant Computation: The program performs multiple divisions to calculate the characters to be printed. These divisions can be computationally expensive and can be optimized.

3. Lack of Loop Optimization: The loops in the program can be optimized to improve performance. Loop unrolling and other loop optimizations can potentially speed up the execution.

4. Lack of Compiler Optimization: The code does not include any compiler optimizations or pragma directives that can hint the compiler to optimize certain parts of the code. Adding compiler optimizations can potentially improve performance.

Based on the analysis, the following optimization strategy can be formulated:

1. Use dynamically allocated arrays instead of global arrays to optimize memory usage.

2. Replace the divisions in the printing loop with more efficient operations.

3. Optimize the loops by unrolling or using other loop optimization techniques.

4. Enable compiler optimizations to leverage the compiler's optimization capabilities.
