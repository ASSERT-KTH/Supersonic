Upon analyzing the provided code, the following potential optimizations can be identified:

1. Use more descriptive variable names: The variable names used in the code are not very descriptive, making it difficult to understand their purpose. By using more meaningful variable names, the code will become more readable and easier to optimize.

2. Optimize the memory usage of the "f" array: The "f" array is used to store the longest proper suffix which is also a proper prefix of the substring ending at the current index. Since the maximum length of the input string is 1000005, the "f" array can also be of the same size. However, the current implementation uses an array of size 1000005, which results in inefficient memory usage. By reducing the size of the "f" array to n, we can optimize the memory usage.

3. Optimize the loop conditions: The loop conditions in the code are not easily understandable. By rewriting the loop conditions in a more readable manner, the code will become easier to understand and optimize.

4. Remove unnecessary computations: The expression `x / (x - f[x]) / k` is being computed twice in the code. By computing it once and storing the result in a variable, we can avoid redundant computations.

5. Add compiler optimizations: Depending on the compiler being used, there might be specific compiler optimizations or pragma directives that can be applied to improve the performance of the code. These optimizations can be explored and applied to further enhance the performance.
