The given code appears to be a C++ program that reads an input string `s` of length `n` and an integer `k`. It then computes an array `f` and uses it to determine the output. The output is a binary sequence printed to the standard output.

Upon initial analysis, the code seems to implement the KMP (Knuth-Morris-Pratt) algorithm, which is an efficient string searching algorithm. However, there are several areas where the code can be optimized for better performance and reduced memory usage.
