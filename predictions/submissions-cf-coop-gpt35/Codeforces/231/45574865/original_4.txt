The provided code reads an integer `n` from the user, followed by a sequence of `n` triplets of integers. For each triplet, it counts the number of occurrences of the value `1` and increments a counter `hasil` if there are at least two occurrences of `1`. Finally, it prints the value of `hasil`.

Upon analyzing the code, a few potential performance bottlenecks and areas for optimization can be identified:
1. The code includes unnecessary header files (`math.h` and `string.h`) that are not used.
2. The code uses the `namespace std` directive, which is generally discouraged in favor of explicitly qualifying the use of standard library functions and types.
3. The code uses a nested loop to iterate over the triplets, which has a time complexity of O(n).
4. The code uses a temporary variable `temp` to count the occurrences of `1`, which is reset to zero for each triplet. This is unnecessary since the value of `temp` is only used within the context of each triplet.
5. The code uses an additional variable `hasil` to count the number of triplets with at least two occurrences of `1`. This can be avoided by directly printing the count while iterating over the triplets.

Based on these observations, the following optimization strategy can be formulated:
1. Remove unnecessary header files (`math.h` and `string.h`).
2. Remove the `namespace std` directive.
3. Replace the nested loop with a single loop that iterates over the triplets.
4. Remove the `temp` variable and directly check for at least two occurrences of `1` within each triplet.
5. Print the count of triplets with at least two occurrences of `1` while iterating over the triplets.

Now, I will provide a step-by-step explanation of each optimization step and present the optimized code.
