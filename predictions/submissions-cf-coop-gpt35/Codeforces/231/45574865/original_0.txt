Code Analysis:
- The code reads an integer `n` from the user.
- It then enters a loop that iterates `n` times.
- Within this loop, there is another loop that iterates 3 times.
- Inside the inner loop, an integer `y` is read from the user.
- If `y` is equal to 1, a counter `temp` is incremented.
- After the inner loop finishes, if `temp` is greater than or equal to 2, another counter `hasil` is incremented.
- Finally, the value of `hasil` is printed.

Potential optimizations:
1. Remove unnecessary headers: The code includes `<math.h>` and `<string.h>` headers, but they are not used. These headers can be removed to reduce unnecessary overhead.
2. Remove `using namespace std;`: The `using namespace std;` statement can be removed to avoid polluting the global namespace. Instead, we can use the `std::` prefix for standard library functions and types.
3. Avoid repeated calculations: The code checks if `y` is equal to 1 inside the inner loop and increments `temp` accordingly. However, this check can be moved outside the loop and performed once after reading all three values of `y`. This avoids redundant checks and increment operations.
4. Initialize variables inside the loop: The variables `temp` and `hasil` are initialized outside the loop, but they are reset to 0 inside the loop. It is better to initialize these variables inside the loop to avoid unnecessary memory operations.
5. Optimize loop termination conditions: The inner loop always iterates exactly 3 times. Instead of using a loop, we can manually read three values of `y` and perform the necessary checks and increments outside the loop. This eliminates the overhead of the inner loop and reduces the number of iterations.
6. Optimize input/output operations: The code uses `cin` and `cout` for input and output operations, respectively. These operations can be slow, especially when used in a loop. Instead, we can use faster input/output functions like `scanf` and `printf` from the C standard library.

Optimization Steps:
1. Remove unnecessary headers:
    - Remove the lines `#include <math.h>` and `#include <string.h>`.
2. Remove `using namespace std;`:
    - Remove the line `using namespace std;`.
3. Avoid repeated calculations:
    - Move the `if (y == 1)` check outside the inner loop.
    - Remove the `temp++` increment statement inside the inner loop.
    - After the inner loop, check if `temp` is greater than or equal to 2 and increment `hasil` accordingly.
4. Initialize variables inside the loop:
    - Remove the line `int temp = 0, hasil = 0;`.
    - Inside the loop, add the line `int temp = 0, hasil = 0;`.
5. Optimize loop termination conditions:
    - Remove the inner loop.
    - Instead, use three separate `scanf` statements to read the three values of `y`.
    - After reading the three values of `y`, check if `temp` is greater than or equal to 2 and increment `hasil` accordingly.
6. Optimize input/output operations:
    - Replace `cin` with `scanf` for reading the value of `n`.
    - Replace `cin` with `scanf` for reading the values of `y`.
    - Replace `cout` with `printf` for printing the value of `hasil`.

Optimized Code:
```cpp
#include <cstdio>

int main() {
  int n;
  scanf("%d", &n);
  int hasil = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    int temp = 0;
    int y1, y2, y3;
    scanf("%d %d %d", &y1, &y2, &y3);
    if (y1 == 1) temp++;
    if (y2 == 1) temp++;
    if (y3 == 1) temp++;
    if (temp >= 2) hasil++;
  }
  printf("%d\n", hasil);
  return 0;
}
```

The optimized code eliminates unnecessary headers, removes the `using namespace std;` statement, avoids repeated calculations, initializes variables inside the loop, optimizes the loop termination conditions, and uses faster input/output functions. These changes improve the efficiency of the code by reducing unnecessary operations and improving memory access patterns.
