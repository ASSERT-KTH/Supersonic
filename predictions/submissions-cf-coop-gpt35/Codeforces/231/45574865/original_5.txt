The provided code seems to be a program that takes an integer input `n`, followed by `n` sets of three integers. For each set, it counts the number of occurrences of the integer `1` and increments the `hasil` variable if the count is greater than or equal to `2`. Finally, it outputs the value of `hasil`.

To optimize this code, we can focus on the following areas:

1. Minimize the number of function calls and unnecessary operations.
2. Optimize the loop structure.
3. Reduce memory usage where possible.

Let's go through each optimization step in detail:

**1. Minimize function calls and unnecessary operations:**

- Remove the `using namespace std;` statement and prefix `cin` and `cout` with `std::` to avoid the overhead of importing the entire `std` namespace.

**2. Optimize the loop structure:**

- Use a more efficient loop structure for reading input. Instead of using nested loops, we can use a single loop and read three integers at a time using `cin` into variables `y1`, `y2`, and `y3`. This eliminates the need for the inner loop and reduces the number of function calls.

**3. Reduce memory usage where possible:**

- We can remove the `math.h` and `string.h` headers as they are not being used in the code.

Now, let's apply these optimizations to the code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  int n, temp = 0, hasil = 0;
  std::cin >> n;
  
  int y1, y2, y3;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    std::cin >> y1 >> y2 >> y3;
    if (y1 == 1) {
      temp++;
    }
    if (y2 == 1) {
      temp++;
    }
    if (y3 == 1) {
      temp++;
    }
    if (temp >= 2) {
      hasil++;
    }
    temp = 0;
  }
  
  std::cout << hasil;
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized code maintains the functionality of the original code while reducing unnecessary operations and memory usage. It should result in improved performance and efficiency.
