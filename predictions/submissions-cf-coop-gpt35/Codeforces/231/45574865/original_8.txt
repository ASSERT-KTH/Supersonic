Code Analysis:
- The code reads an integer `n` from the user and then reads `n` sets of 3 integers.
- For each set of 3 integers, it counts the number of occurrences of 1 and increments a counter `hasil` if the count is greater than or equal to 2.
- Finally, it prints the value of `hasil`.

Potential performance bottlenecks and inefficient memory usage:
- The code uses the `math.h` and `string.h` libraries, but they are not needed in this program.
- The code uses a nested loop to iterate over the sets of 3 integers, which has a time complexity of O(n) * O(3) = O(3n) = O(n).

Optimization Strategy:
1. Remove unnecessary libraries.
2. Optimize the loop by eliminating the inner loop and using a single loop to read the sets of 3 integers.
3. Use a bitwise AND operation instead of equality check to count the occurrences of 1.
4. Use a single counter variable instead of two variables (`temp` and `hasil`).
5. Avoid unnecessary variable assignments.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Remove the unnecessary libraries `math.h` and `string.h`.
2. Replace the nested loop with a single loop to read the sets of 3 integers.
3. Replace the equality check `y == 1` with a bitwise AND operation `y & 1` to count the occurrences of 1.
4. Replace the variables `temp` and `hasil` with a single counter variable `count`.
5. Remove the unnecessary variable assignments `temp = 0` and `hasil = 0`.
6. Update the output statement to print the value of `count`.

Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  int n;
  std::cin >> n;
  
  int count = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    int y1, y2, y3;
    std::cin >> y1 >> y2 >> y3;
    
    count += ((y1 & 1) + (y2 & 1) + (y3 & 1)) >= 2;
  }
  
  std::cout << count;
  return 0;
}
```

The optimized code eliminates unnecessary libraries, uses a single loop to read the sets of 3 integers, counts the occurrences of 1 using bitwise AND operations, and uses a single counter variable. It preserves the functionality and output of the original code while improving performance by reducing the number of operations and memory usage.
