The given code appears to be a program that calculates the number of distinct lines that can be formed by connecting pairs of points on a 2D plane. The program uses sets and maps to keep track of the slopes and intercepts of the lines.

However, the code contains several unnecessary or inefficient constructs that can be optimized for better performance. Some of the potential optimizations include:

1. Unnecessary Header Files: The code includes several unnecessary header files, such as `<bits/stdc++.h>`, `<ext/pb_ds/assoc_container.hpp>`, and `<ext/pb_ds/tree_policy.hpp>`. These unnecessary includes should be removed to reduce compilation time.

2. Excessive Use of Macros: The code contains many macros that define commonly used functions or constants. While macros can improve code readability, excessive use of macros can negatively impact performance. It is recommended to replace some of the macros with inline functions.

3. Global Variables: The code uses global variables extensively, which can make the code harder to understand and optimize. It is recommended to minimize the use of global variables and instead use local variables whenever possible.

4. Redundant Debugging Code: The code includes a debugging class and related macros (`debug` and `Debugger`). These debugging constructs can be removed to improve performance.

5. Inefficient Data Structures: The code uses sets and maps to store the slopes and intercepts of the lines. However, sets and maps have logarithmic time complexity for insertion and deletion, which can be expensive for large inputs. It is recommended to use more efficient data structures, such as unordered sets and unordered maps, which have constant time complexity for insertion and deletion.

6. Unnecessary Sorting: The code sorts the input points in descending order using the `dec` macro. However, the sorted order is not used anywhere in the code. This sorting step can be removed to improve performance.

7. Unnecessary Calculations: The code calculates the number of distinct lines by iterating over all pairs of points and calculating the slopes and intercepts. However, this approach is inefficient and can be optimized. A more efficient approach is to use a formula to calculate the number of distinct lines directly, without iterating over all pairs of points.

8. Unnecessary Memory Usage: The code uses a 2D array to store the input points, even though the points are not accessed as a 2D array. It is recommended to use a 1D array or a vector to store the points, which can reduce memory usage.

Based on these observations, the following optimization steps can be applied:

1. Remove unnecessary header files.
2. Replace some macros with inline functions.
3. Minimize the use of global variables.
4. Remove the debugging code.
5. Replace sets and maps with unordered sets and unordered maps.
6. Remove the unnecessary sorting step.
7. Optimize the calculation of the number of distinct lines.
8. Use a 1D array or a vector to store the input points.

The optimized code is presented below:
