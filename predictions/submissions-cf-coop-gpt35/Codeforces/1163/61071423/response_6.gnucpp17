Code Analysis:
- The code includes a large number of unnecessary header files that are not used in the program.
- The code defines a debugging class and related functions that are not used in the program.
- The code includes a large number of unnecessary macros that are not used in the program.
- The code uses unnecessary typedefs for various data types.
- The code includes unnecessary functions for computing the minimum, maximum, and multiplication of values. These functions can be replaced with the corresponding standard library functions.
- The code includes unnecessary functions for adding and subtracting values. These functions can be replaced with direct addition and subtraction operations.
- The code includes unnecessary functions for reading integers from input. These functions can be replaced with the standard `cin` function.
- The code includes unnecessary functions for converting integers to strings. These functions can be replaced with the `to_string` function from the standard library.
- The code includes unnecessary functions for computing the slope and intercept of a line. These functions can be replaced with direct calculations.
- The code includes unnecessary functions for printing vectors and pairs. These functions can be replaced with the `<<` operator overload for the corresponding types.
- The code uses a set of pairs to store unique slope-intercept pairs. This can be replaced with a set of tuples to improve memory usage.
- The code uses a map to store sets of intercepts for each slope. This can be replaced with a vector of sets to improve memory usage.
- The code includes unnecessary sorting of vectors in descending order.
- The code calculates the number of pairs in a set using a loop. This can be replaced with the formula for combinations to improve performance.
