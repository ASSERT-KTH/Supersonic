Code Analysis:

1. The code includes many unnecessary header files, such as `<bits/stdc++.h>` and `<ext/pb_ds/assoc_container.hpp>`.
2. The code includes several unnecessary macros, such as `debug`, `ok`, `fo`, `repp`, `repr`, `repl`, `newl`, `test`, `start`, `tc`, `nl`, `startk`, `mem`, `inf1`, `repaa`, `big`, `ll128`, `print`, `mt`, `eb`, `p_q`, `bp`, `precision`. Many of these macros are not used in the code at all.
3. The code uses a lot of unnecessary `using` directives, such as `using namespace __gnu_pbds;` and `using namespace std;`. These directives can cause name conflicts and increase the compilation time.
4. The code uses a mixture of different loop styles (`for`, `repp`, `repr`, `repl`). This can make the code harder to read and understand.
5. The code defines several unnecessary types, such as `ll`, `vi`, `vd`, `vl`, `vip`, `vil`, `vll`, `ip`, `il`, `pll`, `state`, `statel`. Many of these types are not used in the code at all.
6. The `gcd` and `lcm` functions are defined using the `__gcd` function from the standard library. However, C++17 introduced the `gcd` and `lcm` functions in the `<numeric>` header, so it is better to use those functions instead.
7. The code includes a lot of unnecessary preprocessor directives, such as `#pragma GCC optimize`, `#pragma comment`, and `#ifdef Fading`. These directives are not needed for the optimization task and can be removed.
8. The code uses `int` for loop variables and array sizes, even though the problem statement mentions that the input size can be as large as 10^5. Using `int` for these variables can lead to overflow issues and incorrect results.

Potential optimizations:
1. Remove unnecessary header files, macros, and using directives to reduce compilation time and avoid potential name conflicts.
2. Replace the `__gcd` function with the `gcd` function provided by C++17.
3. Use `size_t` instead of `int` for loop variables and array sizes to avoid potential overflow issues.
4. Simplify and optimize the computation of the number of pairs of points with the same slope and intercept.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Remove unnecessary header files, macros, and using directives.
   - Remove the following header files: `<bits/stdc++.h>`, `<ext/pb_ds/assoc_container.hpp>`.
   - Remove the following macros: `debug`, `ok`, `fo`, `repp`, `repr`, `repl`, `newl`, `test`, `start`, `tc`, `nl`, `startk`, `mem`, `inf1`, `repaa`, `big`, `ll128`, `print`, `mt`, `eb`, `p_q`, `bp`, `precision`.
   - Remove the following using directives: `using namespace __gnu_pbds;`, `using namespace std;`.

2. Replace the `__gcd` function with the `gcd` function provided by C++17.
   - Replace the `gcd` function with `std::gcd` from the `<numeric>` header.

3. Use `size_t` instead of `int` for loop variables and array sizes.
   - Replace `int` with `size_t` for loop variables and array sizes.

4. Simplify and optimize the computation of the number of pairs of points with the same slope and intercept.
   - Instead of using a set of pairs to store the slopes and intercepts, use a map of slopes to sets of intercepts.
   - Iterate over pairs of points and calculate the slope and intercept for each pair.
   - Use the slope as the key in the map and insert the intercept into the corresponding set.
   - After iterating over all pairs of points, iterate over the map and calculate the number of pairs for each slope.
   - Sum up the number of pairs for each slope and subtract it from the total number of pairs to get the final result.

Optimized Code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <map>
#include <algorithm>
#include <numeric>

typedef std::pair<int, int> Point;
typedef std::pair<int, int> SlopeIntercept;
typedef std::map<int, std::set<int>> SlopeInterceptMap;

int gcd(int a, int b) {
    return std::gcd(a, b);
}

int main() {
    std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    std::cin.tie(0);
    std::cout.tie(0);

    int n;
    std::cin >> n;

    std::vector<Point> points(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        std::cin >> points[i].first >> points[i].second;
    }

    SlopeInterceptMap slopeInterceptMap;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        for (int j = i + 1; j < n; j++) {
            int x1 = points[i].first;
            int y1 = points[i].second;
            int x2 = points[j].first;
            int y2 = points[j].second;

            int dx = x2 - x1;
            int dy = y2 - y1;
            int d = gcd(std::abs(dx), std::abs(dy));

            int slope = (dx / d) * 1000000 + (dy / d);
            int intercept = (y1 * x2 - x1 * y2) / d;

            slopeInterceptMap[slope].insert(intercept);
        }
    }

    long long count = 0;
    for (const auto& it : slopeInterceptMap) {
        int size = it.second.size();
        count += (1LL * size * (size - 1) / 2);
    }

    long long totalPairs = 1LL * n * (n - 1) / 2;
    long long result = totalPairs - count;

    std::cout << result << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

The optimized code removes unnecessary header files, macros, and using directives to reduce compilation time and avoid potential name conflicts. It also replaces the `__gcd` function with the `std::gcd` function provided by C++17
