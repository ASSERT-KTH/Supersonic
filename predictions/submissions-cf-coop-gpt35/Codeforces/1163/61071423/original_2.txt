Code Analysis:

1. The code includes a large number of unnecessary header files, including `<bits/stdc++.h>`, `<ext/pb_ds/assoc_container.hpp>`, and `<ext/pb_ds/tree_policy.hpp>`. These unnecessary header files can be removed to improve compile time and reduce memory usage.

2. The code contains a large number of unnecessary macros and typedefs. These macros and typedefs make the code difficult to read and understand. Removing unnecessary macros and typedefs will improve code readability and maintainability.

3. The code includes various debugging macros and functions (`#if DEBUG && !ONLINE_JUDGE`, `Debugger`, `debug`, etc.). These debugging macros and functions are not necessary for the final optimized code and can be safely removed.

4. The code uses some non-standard optimization pragmas, such as `#pragma GCC optimize("O3")` and `#pragma GCC optimize("unroll-loops")`. While these pragmas may provide some performance improvements, they are not necessary for the final optimized code and can be removed.

5. The code uses some unnecessary features of the C++ language, such as the `endl` manipulator and the `cout` statement for printing a new line. These features can be replaced with the more efficient `'\n'` character and `printf` function, respectively.

6. The code uses a `map` data structure to store sets of pairs. However, the use of a `map` is not necessary, as a `vector` of `set` can achieve the same functionality with better performance.

7. The code uses a nested loop to calculate the number of pairs with the same slope and y-intercept. This nested loop can be optimized by using a formula to calculate the number of pairs directly, without iterating over all possible pairs.

8. The code uses the `gcd` function from the C++ standard library to calculate the greatest common divisor. However, the `gcd` function can be implemented more efficiently using the Euclidean algorithm.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Remove unnecessary header files, macros, typedefs, and debugging code to improve code readability and maintainability.

2. Replace the unnecessary features of the C++ language with more efficient alternatives, such as using `'\n'` instead of `endl` and `printf` instead of `cout`.

3. Replace the `map` data structure with a `vector` of `set` to improve performance.

4. Optimize the calculation of the number of pairs with the same slope and y-intercept by using a formula instead of a nested loop.

5. Implement a more efficient `gcd` function using the Euclidean algorithm.

Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. Remove unnecessary header files, macros, typedefs, and debugging code:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <set>
#include <map>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;
```

2. Replace unnecessary features of the C++ language:
```cpp
#define newl '\n'
#define print(x, n, k)                                                         \
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {                                                  \
    for (int j = 0; j < k; j++) cout << x[i][j] << "  ";                         \
    cout << newl;                                                                \
  }
```

3. Replace the `map` data structure with a `vector` of `set`:
```cpp
vector<set<pair<int, int>>> mp;
```

4. Optimize the calculation of the number of pairs with the same slope and y-intercept:
```cpp
int x = 0;
for (auto i : mp) {
  int si = i.size();
  x += 1LL * si * (si - 1) / 2;
}
int si = s.size();
cout << si * (si - 1) / 2 - x;
```

5. Implement a more efficient `gcd` function using the Euclidean algorithm:
```cpp
int gcd(int a, int b) {
  while (b != 0) {
    int temp = b;
    b = a % b;
    a = temp;
  }
  return a;
}
```

Optimized Code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <set>
#include <map>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

pair<int, int> slope(int x1, int y1, int x2, int y2) {
  int tmp1 = x2 - x1, tmp2 = y2 - y1;
  int tmp3 = gcd(abs(tmp1), abs(tmp2));
  if (tmp1 == 0 && tmp2 == 0)
    return {0, 0};
  if (tmp1 == 0)
    return {1, 0};
  if (tmp2 == 0)
    return {0, 1};
  tmp1 /= tmp3, tmp2 /= tmp3;
  if (tmp1 < 0)
    tmp1 *= -1, tmp2 *= -1;
  return {tmp2, tmp1};
}

pair<int, int> cept(int x1, int y1, int x2, int y2) {
  int tmp1 = y2 * x1 - x2 * y1, tmp2 = x2 - x1;
  int tmp3 = gcd(abs(tmp1), abs(tmp2));
  if (tmp1 == 0 && tmp2 == 0)
    return {0, 0};
  if (tmp1 == 0)
    return {0, 1};
  if (tmp2 == 0)
    return {x1, 0};
  tmp1 /= tmp3, tmp2 /= tmp3;
  if (tmp1 < 0)
    tmp1 *= -1, tmp2 *= -1;
  return {tmp1, tmp2};
}

int gcd(int a, int b) {
  while (b != 0) {
    int temp = b;
    b = a % b;
    a = temp;
  }
  return a;
}

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(0);
  cout.tie(0);
  
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  vector<pair<int, int>> a(n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> a[i].first >> a[i].second;
  }
  
  set<pair<pair<int, int>, pair<int, int>>> s;
  vector<set<pair<int, int>>> mp;
  
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
