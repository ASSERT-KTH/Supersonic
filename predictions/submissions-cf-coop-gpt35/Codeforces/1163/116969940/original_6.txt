Code Analysis:
- The code imports the entire "bits/stdc++.h" header, which is not recommended as it includes unnecessary libraries and can increase compilation time.
- The code defines several macros and typedefs, which can make the code harder to read and understand.
- The code uses multiple unnecessary data structures such as `multiset`, `map`, `set`, and `memset`.
- The code performs unnecessary operations within the loop, such as finding the minimum and maximum values in a set and performing arithmetic calculations.
- The code does not utilize any compiler optimizations.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Remove unnecessary headers: Replace the `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` with the necessary standard library headers.
2. Remove unnecessary macros and typedefs: Remove the unnecessary macros and typedefs to improve code readability.
3. Use a vector instead of a multiset: Replace the `multiset<int>` with a `vector<int>` to avoid the overhead of maintaining a sorted set.
4. Use a vector instead of a map: Replace the `map<int, int>` with a `vector<int>` where the index represents the count and the value represents the frequency.
5. Use a vector instead of a set: Replace the `set<int>` with a `vector<int>` to avoid the overhead of maintaining a sorted set.
6. Use a single loop to perform necessary operations: Combine the multiple if conditions into a single loop to reduce redundant operations.
7. Utilize compiler optimizations: Add compiler optimizations flags or pragma directives to hint the compiler to optimize the code.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Remove unnecessary headers:
   - Replace `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` with the necessary standard library headers, such as `#include <iostream>`, `#include <vector>`, `#include <map>`, and `#include <set>`.
2. Remove unnecessary macros and typedefs:
   - Remove the `#define` statements for `pb`, `ld`, `ll`, `lld`, `print`, `println`, `show`, and `debug`.
3. Use a vector instead of a multiset:
   - Replace the `multiset<int> st;` with `vector<int> st;`.
   - Instead of using `st.insert()` and `st.erase()`, use `st.push_back()` and `st.pop_back()` respectively.
4. Use a vector instead of a map:
   - Replace the `map<int, int> cnt;` with `vector<int> cnt(mxN);`.
   - Instead of using `cnt[x]++` and `cnt[x]--`, use `cnt[x] += 1` and `cnt[x] -= 1` respectively.
5. Use a vector instead of a set:
   - Replace the `set<int> cst;` with `vector<int> cst;`.
   - Instead of using `cst.insert()` and `cst.size()`, use `cst.push_back()` and `cst.size()` respectively.
6. Use a single loop to perform necessary operations:
   - Combine the multiple if conditions related to `ans` calculation into a single loop.
7. Utilize compiler optimizations:
   - Add compiler optimizations flags such as `-O3` to enable aggressive optimizations.
   - Utilize pragma directives such as `#pragma GCC optimize("unroll-loops")` to hint the compiler to optimize certain parts of the code.
