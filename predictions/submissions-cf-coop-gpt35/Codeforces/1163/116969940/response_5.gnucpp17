The given code appears to be solving a problem, but without a clear problem statement, it is difficult to fully understand the purpose of the code. Nevertheless, we can still analyze the code for potential performance optimizations.

Here are some potential areas for optimization:

1. **Unnecessary includes**: The code includes `<bits/stdc++.h>`, which is generally discouraged due to its large size and potential for name clashes. It is recommended to include only the necessary headers explicitly.

2. **Redundant macros**: The code defines macros `pb`, `ld`, `ll`, `lld`, `print`, `println`, `show`, and `debug`. These macros provide shorthand notations for common operations, but they are not used in the code. Removing these macros will improve code readability.

3. **Inefficient data structures**: The code uses a `multiset`, `map`, and `set` to store and manipulate data. These data structures have logarithmic time complexity for many operations, which can be improved to constant time complexity using alternative data structures.

4. **Unnecessary calculations**: The code contains several conditional statements that perform unnecessary calculations. These calculations can be simplified or eliminated to improve performance.

5. **Unused variables**: The variable `t` is declared but never used. Removing this variable will improve code readability.

To optimize the given code, we will follow the following steps:

1. Remove unnecessary includes and macros.
2. Replace inefficient data structures with more efficient alternatives.
3. Simplify or eliminate unnecessary calculations.
4. Remove unused variables.
5. Ensure the optimized code maintains the functionality and output of the original code.
