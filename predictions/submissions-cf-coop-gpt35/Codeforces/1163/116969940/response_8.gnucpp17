The provided code is a C++ program that reads an integer `n` from the input, followed by `n` integers. It then performs some calculations and outputs the result. 

To optimize this code, we can focus on the following areas:

1. Unnecessary includes: The code includes unnecessary headers, such as `<bits/stdc++.h>`. We should only include the necessary headers to reduce compilation time.

2. Unused macros: The code defines macros `pb`, `ld`, `ll`, `lld`, `print`, `println`, and `show`, but none of them are used. We can remove these macros to reduce code complexity.

3. Redundant data structures: The code uses a `multiset` and a `map` to keep track of the count of elements and their frequencies. However, we can simplify this by using only a `vector` and an `unordered_map`. This will reduce memory usage and improve performance.

4. Unnecessary computations: The code performs some unnecessary computations inside nested loops. We can optimize these computations by simplifying the conditions and reducing the number of comparisons.

5. Redundant calculations: The code calculates the minimum and maximum values from the set multiple times. We can optimize this by storing the minimum and maximum values in separate variables and updating them only when necessary.

6. Output: The code prints the result using `cout` without any specific formatting requirements. We can use `printf` instead of `cout` to improve the output performance.
