Code Analysis:

1. The code includes unnecessary header files like `<bits/stdc++.h>`. It is recommended to include only the necessary header files to avoid unnecessary code bloat and improve compilation time.

2. The code uses multiple preprocessor macros like `pb`, `ld`, `ll`, `lld`, `print`, `println`, `show`, `debug`. These macros make the code difficult to read and understand. It is better to avoid using such macros and write clear and concise code.

3. The code initializes a clock variable `time_p` at the beginning and calculates the time taken to execute the code at the end using `clock()`. However, this implementation may not accurately measure the execution time and can be misleading. It is recommended to use more reliable methods like the `<chrono>` library for accurate timing measurements.

4. The code initializes a multi-set `st`, an array `mp`, a map `cnt`, and a set `cst`. These data structures are used for counting and tracking occurrences of elements. However, the code does not provide any explanation for their usage or the purpose they serve. It is important to understand the purpose of these data structures and optimize them if necessary.

5. The code uses a mix of C++ and C-style constructs, such as `memset`, which can be replaced with more efficient C++ constructs like `fill` or `assign`.

6. The code uses multiple unnecessary checks and conditions for calculating the value of `ans`. These conditions can be simplified and optimized.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Remove unnecessary header files: Remove the unnecessary header file `<bits/stdc++.h>` and include only the necessary header files.

2. Remove preprocessor macros: Remove the preprocessor macros `pb`, `ld`, `ll`, `lld`, `print`, `println`, `show`, and `debug`. Write clear and concise code without the use of macros.

3. Replace `clock` with `<chrono>`: Replace the usage of `clock()` for timing measurements with the `<chrono>` library to accurately measure the execution time.

4. Optimize data structures:
   - Replace the multi-set `st` with a vector or array to improve performance.
   - Replace the array `mp` with a map or unordered_map to improve performance and reduce memory usage.
   - Evaluate the usage of the map `cnt` and set `cst` to determine if they are necessary for the given problem.

5. Use C++ constructs instead of C-style constructs: Replace the usage of `memset` with more efficient C++ constructs like `fill` or `assign`.

6. Simplify conditions for calculating `ans`: Simplify and optimize the conditions used to calculate the value of `ans`.

Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. Remove unnecessary header files: Remove the line `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` and include only the necessary header files.

2. Remove preprocessor macros: Remove the preprocessor macros `pb`, `ld`, `ll`, `lld`, `print`, `println`, `show`, and `debug`. Write clear and concise code without the use of macros.

3. Replace `clock` with `<chrono>`: Replace the usage of `clock()` for timing measurements with the `<chrono>` library to accurately measure the execution time. Use the `high_resolution_clock` for precise timing measurements.

4. Optimize data structures:
   - Replace the multi-set `st` with a vector or array to improve performance. Since the maximum size is given as `100005`, we can use an array of size `100005` to store the count of occurrences of each element.
   - Replace the array `mp` with a map or unordered_map to improve performance and reduce memory usage. Since the maximum size is given as `100005`, we can use an unordered_map to store the count of occurrences of each element.
   - Evaluate the usage of the map `cnt` and set `cst` to determine if they are necessary for the given problem. If they are not necessary, remove them to optimize memory usage.

5. Use C++ constructs instead of C-style constructs: Replace the usage of `memset` with more efficient C++ constructs like `fill` or `assign`. Use the `fill` function to initialize the array `mp` with zeroes.

6. Simplify conditions for calculating `ans`: Simplify and optimize the conditions used to calculate the value of `ans`. Analyze the conditions and simplify them based on the logic and requirements of the problem.
