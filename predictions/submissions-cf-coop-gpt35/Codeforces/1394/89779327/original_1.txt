The given code appears to be solving a combinatorial problem. It reads inputs `n`, `m`, and `k`, and then reads `m` lines of input containing three integers `x`, `y`, and `z`. It then performs some calculations and outputs the result.

Upon analyzing the code, we can identify the following potential areas for optimization:

1. Excessive use of global variables: The code uses a large number of global variables, which can make the code harder to understand and maintain. We can consider reducing the number of global variables and passing necessary variables as function arguments.

2. Inefficient data structures: The code uses vectors to store pairs of integers. However, since the number of elements is known in advance, we can consider using arrays instead of vectors to improve memory efficiency.

3. Redundant calculations: There are certain calculations being performed multiple times that can be avoided by storing the results in variables or arrays.

4. Inefficient sorting: There are several sorting operations being performed that can be optimized to reduce time complexity.

Now, let's formulate an optimization strategy and explain each step in detail.
