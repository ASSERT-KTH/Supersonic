Code Analysis:
1. The code uses a recursive function `rec` to calculate the number of valid permutations. It uses nested loops and bitwise operations to check for valid combinations and update the state.
2. The code uses a 3-dimensional array `ban` to store the banned combinations.
3. The code uses a 2-dimensional array `slf` to mark self-referencing combinations.
4. The code uses a 2-dimensional array `used` to keep track of used combinations.
5. The code uses a 2-dimensional array `cnt` to count the occurrences of combinations.
6. The code uses a 2-dimensional array `sv` to store the state of `used` during recursion.
7. The code uses vectors `v` and `g` to store and process the input data.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Instead of using a 3-dimensional array `ban`, we can use a 2-dimensional array `ban` and calculate the banned combinations on-the-fly during the recursion. This will reduce the memory usage.
2. Instead of using a 2-dimensional array `slf`, we can use a vector `slf` to store the self-referencing combinations. This will reduce memory usage and simplify the code.
3. Instead of using a 2-dimensional array `used`, we can use a bitmask `used` to store the used combinations. This will reduce memory usage and simplify the code.
4. Instead of using a 2-dimensional array `cnt`, we can use a vector `cnt` to store the counts of combinations. This will reduce memory usage and simplify the code.
5. Instead of using a 2-dimensional array `sv`, we can use a vector `sv` to store the state of `used` during recursion. This will reduce memory usage and simplify the code.
6. Instead of using vectors `v` and `g`, we can directly process the input data in a single loop. This will reduce memory usage and simplify the code.
7. We can use compiler optimizations, such as loop unrolling, to further improve performance.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Remove the unnecessary `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` as it includes all the standard headers and is not required.
2. Replace the `using namespace std;` with individual `using` statements to improve code readability.
3. Remove the unnecessary `const int mod = 1e9 + 7;` as it is not used in the code.
4. Replace the macro `N` with a constant variable `const int N = 200200;` to improve code readability.
5. Replace the unnecessary `fi` and `se` macros with `first` and `second` to improve code readability.
6. Replace the 3-dimensional array `ban` with a 2-dimensional array `ban` and calculate the banned combinations on-the-fly during the recursion. This will reduce memory usage and simplify the code.
   a. Remove the 3-dimensional array `ban` declaration: `int ban[10][10][10]`.
   b. Replace the `ban[i][j][h]` with `((1 << g[i][h].se) << (g[i][h].fi - 1))` to calculate the banned combination during recursion.
7. Replace the 2-dimensional array `slf` with a vector `slf` to store the self-referencing combinations. This will reduce memory usage and simplify the code.
   a. Remove the 2-dimensional array `slf` declaration: `int slf[10][10]`.
   b. Declare a vector `slf` to store the self-referencing combinations: `vector<pair<int, int>> slf`.
   c. Replace the `slf[g[i][j].fi][g[i][j].se] = true;` with `slf.push_back(g[i][j]);` to store the self-referencing combination.
   d. Replace the loop `for (int j = 0; j < i; j++)` with `for (const auto& self : slf)` to iterate over the self-referencing combinations.
   e. Replace the condition `if (used[i] & (1 << j) || slf[i][j])` with `if (used[i] & (1 << j) || (self.fi == i && self.se == j))` to check for self-referencing combinations.
8. Replace the 2-dimensional array `used` with a bitmask `used` to store the used combinations. This will reduce memory usage and simplify the code.
   a. Remove the 2-dimensional array `used` declaration: `int used[10]`.
   b. Declare a bitmask `used` to store the used combinations: `int used = 0`.
   c. Replace the `used[i] |= ban[i][j][h];` with `used |= ((1 << g[i][h].se) << (g[i][h].fi - 1));` to update the used combinations bitmask.
   d. Replace the `used[h] = sv[i][h];` with `used = sv[i][h];` to restore the state of `used` during recursion.
9. Replace the 2-dimensional array `cnt` with a vector `cnt` to store the counts of combinations. This will reduce memory usage and simplify the code.
   a. Remove the 2-dimensional array `cnt` declaration: `int cnt[10][10]`.
   b. Declare a vector `cnt` to store the counts of combinations: `vector<vector<int>> cnt(k + 1, vector<int>(k + 1, 0))`.
   c. Replace the `cnt[g[i][j].fi][g[i][j].se] += 1;` with `cnt[g[i][j].fi][g[i][j].se]++;` to increment the count of combinations.
10. Replace the 2-dimensional array `sv` with a vector `sv` to store the state of `used` during recursion. This will reduce memory usage and simplify the code.
    a. Remove the 2-dimensional array `sv` declaration: `int sv[10][10]`.
    b. Declare a vector `sv` to store the state of `used` during recursion: `vector<int> sv(k + 1, 0)`.
    c. Replace the `sv[i][h] = used[h];` with `sv[h] = used;` to store the state of `used` during recursion.
    d. Replace the `used[h] = sv[i][h];` with `used = sv[h];` to restore the state of `used` during recursion.
11. Process the input data in a single loop instead of using vectors `v` and `g`. This will reduce memory usage and simplify the code.
    a. Remove the `vector<pair<int, int>> v[N], g[N];` declarations.
    b. Replace the loop `for (int i = 1; i <= m; i++)` with `for (int i = 0; i < m; i++)` to iterate over the input data.
    c. Replace the `v[x].push_back({z, y});` with `g[y].push_back({z, x});` to process the input data directly.
    d. Remove the loop `for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++)`.
    e. Replace the loop `for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++)` with `for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)` to iterate over the processed input data.
    f. Replace the `if (g[i].empty()) {` with `if (g[i].size() == 0) {` to check if the combination is empty.
12. Add compiler optimizations, such as loop unrolling and pragma directives, to improve performance.
    a. Use loop unrolling in the recursion loop by manually unrolling the loop for `i = 1` and `j = 0`.
    b. Use pragma directives to hint the compiler to optimize certain parts of the code.
