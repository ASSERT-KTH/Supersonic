The given code is solving a combinatorial problem, but it is not optimized for efficiency. Here are some potential optimizations:

1. Avoid using `bits/stdc++.h`: The code includes the entire standard library, which can slow down compilation time. Instead, include only the necessary headers explicitly.

2. Avoid using global variables: The code uses global variables for many arrays and variables. This can make the code harder to understand and maintain. Instead, pass variables as function arguments and return values as needed.

3. Use `constexpr` for constants: The constants `N` and `mod` can be made `constexpr` to enable compile-time evaluation and potentially improve performance.

4. Optimize the recursion: The function `rec` is implemented recursively, which can be expensive in terms of memory and time. Consider optimizing this recursion by using memoization or dynamic programming techniques.

5. Avoid unnecessary sorting: In the main function, the vectors `v[i]` and `g[i]` are sorted multiple times. Sorting can be an expensive operation, especially if performed multiple times. Instead, consider using a more efficient data structure or algorithm to avoid the need for sorting.

6. Optimize the inner loop: The inner loop in the main function is currently iterating over all elements of `g[i]` twice. This can be optimized by storing the size of `g[i]` in a separate variable and using it in the loop condition and loop body.

7. Optimize the innermost loop: The innermost loop in the main function is iterating over all elements of `g[i]` again to compute the values of `cnt` and `ban`. This can be optimized by using a more efficient algorithm or data structure to avoid the need for this loop.

8. Use compiler optimizations: Consider enabling compiler optimizations, such as loop unrolling, inline expansion, and vectorization. These optimizations can be enabled using compiler flags or pragmas specific to the compiler being used.

Now, let's apply these optimizations step by step.
