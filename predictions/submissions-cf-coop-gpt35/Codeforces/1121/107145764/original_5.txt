Upon analyzing the given code, I have identified a few areas that can be optimized for efficiency:

1. Input/Output: The code uses `cin` and `cout` for input/output operations. These operations can be slow due to synchronization with the standard C input/output streams. We can improve the performance by disabling the synchronization between C and C++ standard streams using `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false)`. However, note that this may cause issues if mixing C and C++ input/output operations.

2. Data Structures: The code uses a `vector` to store the input values and a `map` to store sums and their frequencies. The `vector` is an efficient choice for storing the input values, but the `map` may not be the most efficient data structure for this problem. We can use an `unordered_map` instead, which provides constant-time average complexity for insertion and lookup.

3. Loop Optimization: The code uses nested loops to calculate the sums and frequencies. We can optimize these loops by reducing the number of iterations. Since the order of the numbers does not matter for calculating the sum, we can start the inner loop from `i+1` instead of `0`. This avoids redundant calculations and reduces the number of iterations.

4. Iterator Declaration: The code declares an iterator `it` outside the loop but does not use it. We can remove this declaration to avoid unnecessary overhead.

Based on these observations, here's the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>

int main() {
    std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    std::cin.tie(0);
    std::cout.tie(0);

    int n;
    std::cin >> n;

    std::vector<int> v(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        std::cin >> v[i];
    }

    std::unordered_map<int, int> mp;
    for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
        for (int j = i + 1; j < n; j++) {
            int x = v[i] + v[j];
            mp[x]++;
        }
    }

    int z = 0, c = 0;
    for (const auto& pair : mp) {
        if (pair.second > c) {
            z = pair.first;
            c = pair.second;
        }
    }

    std::cout << c << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

This optimized code improves performance by using an `unordered_map` instead of a `map`, optimizing the loops, and removing unnecessary iterator declaration. It also preserves the functionality and output of the original code.
