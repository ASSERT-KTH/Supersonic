The given code is a C++ program that reads an integer `n` from the input and then reads `n` integers into an array `cont`. It then calculates the number of distinct elements in the suffix starting from each index in `cont`. Finally, it calculates the sum of the number of distinct elements in the suffix starting from each index except the last index, where the element itself is included.

To optimize this code, we can focus on the following areas:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` includes a large number of standard library headers, which can slow down the compilation process. We should only include the necessary headers for this program, which are `<iostream>`, `<cstring>`, and `<set>`.

2. Avoid using global variables: The variables `n`, `m`, `cont`, `used`, and `cnt` are declared as global variables. It is generally better to avoid using global variables as they can make the code harder to understand and maintain. We can move these variables inside the `main` function.

3. Avoid using `std::endl`: The `std::endl` manipulator flushes the output buffer, which can be costly in terms of performance. Instead, we can use the newline character `'\n'` to end the line.

4. Avoid using `std::ios::sync_with_stdio`: The `std::ios::sync_with_stdio` function synchronizes the C++ standard streams with the standard C streams, which can be expensive. In this code, it is not necessary to synchronize the streams, so we can remove this line.

5. Use `std::vector` instead of arrays: The code uses arrays `cont`, `used`, and `cnt` to store data. Using `std::vector` instead of arrays can provide better memory management and performance. We can replace the arrays with vectors.

6. Avoid using `std::set`: The code uses a set to keep track of distinct elements in the suffix. However, using a set requires maintaining a sorted order and can have an overhead of O(log n) for insertion and removal operations. We can avoid using a set and come up with a more efficient approach.

7. Optimize the algorithm: The current algorithm has a time complexity of O(n^2) due to the nested loop. We can optimize the algorithm to achieve a time complexity of O(n) by using a different approach.

With these optimizations in mind, let's proceed with the step-by-step explanation of the optimized code.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cstring>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int n;
  while (cin >> n) {
    vector<int> cont(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      cin >> cont[i];
    }
    vector<int> used(n + 1, 0);
    vector<int> cnt(n, 0);
    long long ans = 0;

    for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
      if (!used[cont[i]]) {
        used[cont[i]] = 1;
        ans += cnt[i + 1];
      }
      cnt[i] = cnt[i + 1] + !used[cont[i]];
    }

    cout << ans << '\n';
  }
  return 0;
}
```

In the optimized code:

1. We have replaced the unnecessary includes with the required ones.

2. The global variables have been moved inside the `main` function and converted into vectors.

3. The use of `std::endl` has been replaced with the newline character `'\n'`.

4. The `std::ios::sync_with_stdio` line has been removed.

5. Instead of using a set, we have optimized the algorithm to use vectors `used` and `cnt`. The vector `used` keeps track of the elements that have been used previously, and the vector `cnt` stores the number of distinct elements in the suffix starting from each index.

6. We have optimized the algorithm to achieve a time complexity of O(n) by combining the calculation of `ans` and `cnt` in a single loop.

These optimizations aim to improve the performance of the code while preserving its functionality and output.
