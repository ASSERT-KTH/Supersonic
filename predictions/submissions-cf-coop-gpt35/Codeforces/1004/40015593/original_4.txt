The given code reads an integer `n` and an array `cont` of size `n` from the input. It then calculates the number of distinct elements in the suffix of `cont` starting from each index `i` and stores them in the array `cnt`. Finally, it calculates the number of distinct elements in the prefix of `cont` ending at each index `i` and adds them to a running total `ans` if the element at index `i` has not been used before. The final `ans` is printed.

To optimize this code, we can focus on the following areas:

1. Avoiding unnecessary memory usage: The arrays `used` and `cnt` have a fixed size of `100005`, which is unnecessary if the input `n` is smaller. We can dynamically allocate memory for these arrays based on the value of `n` to avoid wasting memory.

2. Eliminating redundant computations: The code calculates the number of distinct elements in the suffix of `cont` for each index `i`. This can be optimized by calculating it once and reusing the result for each iteration of the loop.

3. Improving data structures: The code uses a set to store distinct elements in the suffix of `cont`. However, using a set incurs a logarithmic time complexity for insertion and lookup operations. We can replace the set with a data structure that has a constant time complexity for these operations, such as an unordered_set.

4. Compiler optimizations: We can use compiler optimizations to improve the performance of the code. This can include enabling compiler optimizations flags (`-O2` or `-O3`), using pragma directives to provide hints to the compiler, or using compiler-specific optimizations.

Now let's go through each optimization step in detail:

1. Avoiding unnecessary memory usage:
   - Instead of using fixed-size arrays for `used` and `cnt`, we can dynamically allocate memory based on the value of `n`. This will avoid wasting memory when `n` is smaller than `100005`.
   - We can use `std::vector` instead of raw arrays to dynamically allocate memory and handle the resizing automatically.

2. Eliminating redundant computations:
   - The code calculates the number of distinct elements in the suffix of `cont` for each index `i` in a loop. This can be optimized by calculating it once and reusing the result for each iteration of the loop.
   - We can calculate the number of distinct elements in the suffix of `cont` in a separate loop before the main loop.

3. Improving data structures:
   - The code uses a set to store distinct elements in the suffix of `cont`. However, using a set incurs a logarithmic time complexity for insertion and lookup operations.
   - We can replace the set with an unordered_set, which has a constant time complexity for these operations.

4. Compiler optimizations:
   - We can enable compiler optimizations flags (`-O2` or `-O3`) to allow the compiler to perform various optimization techniques.
   - We can use pragma directives to provide hints to the compiler, such as loop unrolling or function inlining, to optimize specific sections of the code.

Here's the optimized code with the proposed changes:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_set>

int main() {
  std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  std::cin.tie(nullptr);

  int n;
  while (std::cin >> n) {
    std::vector<int> cont(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      std::cin >> cont[i];
    }

    std::vector<int> used(n + 1, 0);
    std::vector<int> cnt(n, 0);
    std::unordered_set<int> distinctElements;

    for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
      distinctElements.insert(cont[i]);
      cnt[i] = distinctElements.size();
    }

    long long ans = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
      if (!used[cont[i]]) {
        used[cont[i]] = 1;
        ans += cnt[i + 1];
      }
    }

    std::cout << ans << '\n';
  }

  return 0;
}
```

By making these optimizations, we have reduced unnecessary memory usage, eliminated redundant computations, improved data structures, and provided suggestions for compiler optimizations. These changes should result in improved performance and reduced memory usage compared to the original code.
