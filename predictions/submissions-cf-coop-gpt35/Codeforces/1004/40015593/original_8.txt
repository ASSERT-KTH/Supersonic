The provided code reads an integer `n`, followed by `n` integers. It then calculates the number of distinct elements in the suffix of the array starting from each position, and computes the sum of these counts for all positions except the last one. Finally, it prints the sum.

Upon analyzing the code, we can identify a few potential areas for optimization:

1. Use of `memset`: The code uses `memset` to initialize the `used` array to 0 in each iteration of the while loop. This is unnecessary since the array is already initialized to 0 at the beginning of each iteration.

2. Use of `set`: The code uses a `set` to store the distinct elements in the suffix of the array. However, using a `set` incurs a logarithmic time complexity for insertion and lookup, which can be avoided.

3. Unused variables: The variables `m` and `cnt` are declared but never used in the code. Removing them will improve readability.

With these optimizations in mind, let's proceed with the step-by-step explanation of the proposed optimizations:

Step 1: Remove unnecessary `memset`
The `used` array is already initialized to 0 when it is declared, so there is no need to use `memset` to reinitialize it to 0 in each iteration. We can safely remove the line `memset(used, 0, sizeof(used));`.

Step 2: Replace `set` with a more efficient data structure
The `set` data structure is used to store the distinct elements in the suffix of the array. However, using a `set` incurs a logarithmic time complexity for insertion and lookup. We can optimize this by using a `unordered_set` instead, which has an average constant time complexity for insertion and lookup.

Step 3: Remove unused variables
The variables `m` and `cnt` are declared but never used in the code. Removing them will improve readability and reduce unnecessary memory usage.

With these optimizations in place, here's the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_set>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(0);
  cin.tie(0);
  int n;
  while (cin >> n) {
    long long ans = 0;
    int cont[100005];
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      cin >> cont[i];
    }
    unordered_set<int> st;
    for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
      st.insert(cont[i]);
      ans += st.size();
    }
    for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
      ans -= st.size();
      st.erase(cont[i]);
    }
    cout << ans << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```

In the optimized code, we have removed the unnecessary `memset`, replaced the `set` with an `unordered_set`, and removed the unused variables. These changes improve the time complexity of the code and eliminate unnecessary memory usage.

Please note that the optimized code assumes that the input values are within the range of the `cont` array. If the input values can exceed this range, you may need to adjust the size of the `cont` array accordingly.
