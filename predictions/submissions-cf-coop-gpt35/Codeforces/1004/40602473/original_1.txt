Code Analysis:
1. The code includes unnecessary header files.
2. The code uses macros like `rrep`, `rep`, `sqr`, `all`, `pb`, `random` which are not used in the code.
3. The code uses global variables `freq` and `cfreq` which can be avoided by passing them as function arguments.
4. The code uses `goto` statement which should be avoided as it makes the code harder to read and understand.
5. The code uses unnecessary variable `k` in the main function.
6. The code computes `n` and `m` in the loop instead of using the already computed values.
7. The code calculates `y` in the loop instead of using the already computed values.
8. The code uses an inefficient method to check if the given values are valid.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Remove unnecessary header files.
2. Remove unused macros.
3. Remove global variables `freq` and `cfreq` and pass them as function arguments.
4. Remove unnecessary variable `k` in the main function.
5. Calculate `n` and `m` outside the loop and use the already computed values.
6. Calculate `y` outside the loop and use the already computed value.
7. Replace the `goto` statement with a loop.
8. Optimize the `isvalid` function.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Remove unnecessary header files.
   - The code includes unnecessary header files like `algorithm`, `cassert`, `cmath`, `cstdio`, `cstring`, `ctime`, `iomanip`, `iostream`, `map`, `set`, `sstream`, `vector`.
   - Removing these unnecessary header files will improve compilation time and reduce unnecessary dependencies.
   
2. Remove unused macros.
   - The code defines macros like `rrep`, `rep`, `sqr`, `all`, `pb`, `random` which are not used in the code.
   - Removing these unused macros will reduce code complexity and improve readability.
   
3. Remove global variables `freq` and `cfreq` and pass them as function arguments.
   - The code uses global variables `freq` and `cfreq` which can be avoided by passing them as function arguments.
   - This will improve the clarity of the code and make it easier to understand and maintain.
   
4. Remove unnecessary variable `k` in the main function.
   - The code declares an unnecessary variable `k` in the main function.
   - Removing this unnecessary variable will simplify the code and improve readability.
   
5. Calculate `n` and `m` outside the loop and use the already computed values.
   - The code calculates `n` and `m` inside the loop using `T % n == 0`.
   - We can calculate `n` and `m` outside the loop and use the already computed values.
   - This will avoid unnecessary calculations and improve efficiency.
   
6. Calculate `y` outside the loop and use the already computed value.
   - The code calculates `y` inside the loop using `y = n + m - b - x`.
   - We can calculate `y` outside the loop and use the already computed value.
   - This will avoid unnecessary calculations and improve efficiency.
   
7. Replace the `goto` statement with a loop.
   - The code uses a `goto` statement which makes the code harder to read and understand.
   - We can replace the `goto` statement with a loop to improve the readability of the code.
   
8. Optimize the `isvalid` function.
   - The current implementation of the `isvalid` function is inefficient.
   - We can optimize the function by avoiding unnecessary calculations and using a more efficient approach.
   - This will improve the performance of the function and reduce the running time of the program.
