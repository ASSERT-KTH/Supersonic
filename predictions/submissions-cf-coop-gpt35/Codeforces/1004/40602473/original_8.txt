Code Analysis:

1. The code includes several unnecessary includes. For example, `cassert`, `cmath`, `ctime`, `iomanip`, `map`, `set`, `sstream`, and `vector` are not used in the code and can be removed.

2. The code uses macros for loop iteration, which can be replaced with regular for loops. This will make the code more readable and easier to understand.

3. The code uses a global array `freq` to store the frequency of each input value. This array is filled with zeros before counting the frequencies. However, the array is not used after that, so it can be removed to save memory.

4. The code uses a global array `cfreq` to store the frequency of each distance value. This array is filled with zeros before calculating the distances. However, the array is not used after that, so it can be removed to save memory.

5. The code uses a `goto` statement to jump to the end of the program after finding a solution. This can be replaced with a `return` statement, which will make the code flow more clear and avoid unnecessary labels.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: Remove the unnecessary includes to reduce compile time and improve code readability.

2. Replace macros with regular for loops: Replace the macros `rrep` and `rep` with regular for loops to improve code readability and maintainability.

3. Remove unused global arrays: Remove the global arrays `freq` and `cfreq` since they are not used after their initializations.

4. Replace `goto` statement with `return` statement: Replace the `goto` statement with a `return` statement to improve code flow and avoid unnecessary labels.

Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: Remove the unnecessary includes to reduce compile time and improve code readability.

2. Replace macros with regular for loops: Replace the macros `rrep` and `rep` with regular for loops to improve code readability and maintainability.

3. Remove unused global arrays: Remove the global arrays `freq` and `cfreq` since they are not used after their initializations.

4. Replace `goto` statement with `return` statement: Replace the `goto` statement with a `return` statement to improve code flow and avoid unnecessary labels.

Optimized Code:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

const int MAXN = 1000000;

bool isvalid(int n, int m, int x, int y) {
  if (x < 1 || x > n || y < 1 || y > m)
    return false;
  int freq[MAXN] = {0};
  int cfreq[MAXN] = {0};
  int T = n * m;
  int i, j;
  x--;
  y--;
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++)
    for (j = 0; j < m; j++)
      cfreq[(abs(x - i) + abs(y - j))]++;
  for (i = 0; i < T; i++)
    if (cfreq[i] != freq[i])
      return false;
  return true;
}

int main() {
  int T;
  cin >> T;
  int t, b = -1, x;
  for (t = 0; t < T; t++) {
    int k;
    cin >> k;
    b = max(b, k);
  }
  for (t = 1; t < T; t++) {
    if (t > 0 && (freq[t] != (t << 2)))
      break;
  }
  x = t;
  int n, m, y;
  for (n = 1; n * n <= T; n++) {
    if (T % n == 0) {
      m = T / n;
      y = n + m - b - x;
      if (isvalid(n, m, x, y)) {
        cout << n << " " << m << endl;
        cout << x << " " << y << endl;
        return 0;
      } else if (isvalid(m, n, x, y)) {
        cout << m << " " << n << endl;
        cout << x << " " << y << endl;
        return 0;
      }
    }
  }
  cout << -1 << endl;
  return 0;
}
```

Note: The optimized code assumes that the `freq` and `cfreq` arrays were intended to be local arrays, as there is no need to use them as global arrays.
