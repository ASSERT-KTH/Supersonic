Code Analysis:
- The code includes several unnecessary includes that are not used in the program.
- The code uses macros for loop iteration and the square function, which can be replaced with regular loops and the pow function.
- The code uses global variables for the frequency array and the cfreq array, which can be allocated on the stack instead.
- The code uses a goto statement, which can be replaced with a loop construct.
- The code uses the fill function to initialize arrays, which can be replaced with a loop.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Remove unnecessary includes: The includes for <algorithm>, <cassert>, <cmath>, <cstdio>, <ctime>, <iomanip>, <iostream>, <map>, <set>, and <sstream> are not used in the program and can be removed.

2. Replace macros with regular loops and functions:
   - Replace the rrep and rep macros with regular for loops.
   - Replace the sqr macro with the pow function.

3. Allocate frequency arrays on the stack: Replace the global frequency arrays with local arrays allocated on the stack.

4. Replace goto statement with a loop construct: Replace the goto statement with a while loop.

5. Use a loop to initialize arrays: Replace the fill function with a loop to initialize the frequency arrays.

6. Consider compiler optimizations: Add compiler optimizations or pragma directives to hint the compiler to optimize certain parts of the code.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Remove unnecessary includes:
   - Remove the includes for <algorithm>, <cassert>, <cmath>, <cstdio>, <ctime>, <iomanip>, <iostream>, <map>, <set>, and <sstream>.

2. Replace macros with regular loops and functions:
   - Replace the rrep and rep macros with regular for loops.
   - Replace the sqr macro with the pow function.

3. Allocate frequency arrays on the stack:
   - Replace the global frequency arrays 'freq' and 'cfreq' with local arrays allocated on the stack.

4. Replace goto statement with a loop construct:
   - Replace the goto statement with a while loop.

5. Use a loop to initialize arrays:
   - Replace the fill function with a loop to initialize the frequency arrays.

6. Consider compiler optimizations:
   - Add compiler optimizations or pragma directives to hint the compiler to optimize certain parts of the code.
