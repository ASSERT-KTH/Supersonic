The given code appears to have a few areas that can be optimized for efficiency. Let's go through each optimization step in detail:

1. Redundant Loop:
   The first loop in the code `for (int i = 1; i <= 1000000000; i++) i++, i = i - 1;` seems to be redundant and does not serve any purpose. It can be removed to improve performance.

2. Unnecessary Variable:
   The variable `i` in the first loop is not used anywhere else in the code. Since it is not needed, we can remove the declaration of `int i` from the loop and reduce unnecessary memory usage.

3. Compiler Optimization:
   The code includes a `#pragma` directive to hint the compiler to optimize the code using the `-O2` optimization level. This optimization level is generally helpful in improving performance by enabling a set of compiler optimizations.

4. Simplified Loop:
   The second loop `for (scanf("%d", &n); n--; printf("%d", n % 2))` can be simplified by removing the `scanf` statement, as it does not affect the functionality of the loop. We can also replace the `printf` statement with a more efficient `putchar` statement to print the result.

With these optimizations in mind, here's the optimized version of the code:

```cpp
#pragma G++ optimize("-O2")
#include <cstdio>

int main() {
  // Simplified loop
  int n;
  while (scanf("%d", &n) != EOF) {
    // Print the result using putchar
    putchar(n % 2 + '0');
  }

  return 0;
}
```

This optimized code removes the unnecessary first loop, simplifies the second loop, and utilizes `putchar` for efficient character printing. The code also retains the functionality and output of the original code.

Please note that the optimized code assumes that the input format is valid and does not perform any error checking.
