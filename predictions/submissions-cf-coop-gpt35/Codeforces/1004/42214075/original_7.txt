The given code has two main parts: a loop that runs a billion iterations, and a loop that reads an integer and prints its parity. Let's analyze each part separately for potential optimizations.

1. Loop with a billion iterations:
   - The loop is running a billion iterations but it doesn't perform any useful computation. It only increments `i` twice and then subtracts 1 from it. This loop can be completely removed as it doesn't serve any purpose and only wastes CPU cycles.

2. Loop to read an integer and print its parity:
   - The loop reads an integer `n` and prints the parity of `n` (0 if `n` is even, 1 if `n` is odd). This loop can be optimized by eliminating the unnecessary `printf` call for each iteration.
   - Instead of printing the parity in each iteration, we can calculate the parity of `n` once and print it after the loop completes.

Based on the analysis, here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <cstdio>

int main() {
  int n;
  scanf("%d", &n);
  int parity = n % 2;
  printf("%d", parity);
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized code eliminates the useless loop and calculates the parity of `n` only once, resulting in improved performance and reduced memory usage.

Please note that the `#pragma G++ optimize("-O2")` directive is unnecessary and can be removed as it is not required for the given code.
