Code Analysis:
- The code reads an integer `n` from the input, followed by an array of `n` integers.
- The array is then split into two vectors: `odd` and `even`, where `odd` contains all odd numbers from the array and `even` contains all even numbers.
- Finally, the code prints the elements of `odd` followed by the elements of `even`.

Potential performance bottlenecks and inefficient memory usage:
1. The code uses `vector<int>` to store the odd and even numbers separately. This requires additional memory allocation and introduces overhead when resizing the vectors.
2. The code uses a separate loop to print the elements of `odd` and `even`, which could be combined into a single loop.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Instead of using separate `vector<int>` containers for odd and even numbers, we can use two separate arrays (`odd` and `even`) to store the numbers. This will eliminate the overhead of memory allocation and resizing for vectors.
2. Combine the loops used to print the elements of `odd` and `even` into a single loop, reducing the number of iterations.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Replace `vector<int> odd;` with `int odd[n];` and `vector<int> even;` with `int even[n];` to use arrays instead of vectors.
   - Rationale: Using arrays eliminates the overhead of memory allocation and resizing for vectors.
   - Trade-offs: None. This change is a direct replacement and does not introduce any additional complexity.
2. Modify the code inside the loop `loop(i, n)` to store the odd and even numbers directly in the arrays `odd` and `even`, respectively.
   - Replace `odd.push_back(arr[i]);` with `odd[odd_count++] = arr[i];` and declare `int odd_count = 0;` before the loop.
   - Replace `even.push_back(arr[i]);` with `even[even_count++] = arr[i];` and declare `int even_count = 0;` before the loop.
   - Rationale: Storing the numbers directly in arrays eliminates the overhead of `push_back` operations, resulting in improved performance.
   - Trade-offs: None. This change is a direct replacement and does not introduce any additional complexity.
3. Combine the loops used to print the elements of `odd` and `even` into a single loop.
   - Replace the `if-else` block with a single loop:
     ```
     for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
       cout << (i < odd_count ? odd[i] : even[i - odd_count]) << " ";
     }
     ```
   - Rationale: Combining the loops reduces the number of iterations, improving performance.
   - Trade-offs: None. This change simplifies the code and does not introduce any additional complexity.

Optimized Code:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
#define IOS \
  ios::sync_with_stdio(0); \
  cin.tie(0); \
  cout.tie(0);
#define endl "\n"
#define frfr freopen("input.txt", "r", stdin);
#define loop(i, n) for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
#define ll long long int
void solve(int te) {
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  int arr[n];
  int odd[n], even[n];
  int odd_count = 0, even_count = 0;
  loop(i, n) {
    cin >> arr[i];
    if (arr[i] % 2) {
      odd[odd_count++] = arr[i];
    } else {
      even[even_count++] = arr[i];
    }
  }
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cout << (i < odd_count ? odd[i] : even[i - odd_count]) << " ";
  }
  cout << endl;
}
int main() {
  IOS;
  int te;
  cin >> te;
  for (int i = 1; i <= te; ++i) {
    solve(i);
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Note: The code assumes that the input array will always have `n` elements. If this is not the case, additional error handling should be added to ensure the code does not access out-of-bounds memory.
