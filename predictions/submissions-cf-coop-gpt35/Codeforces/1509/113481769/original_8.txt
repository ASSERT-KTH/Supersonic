The given code reads an integer `n` as input, followed by an array of `n` integers. It then separates the odd and even numbers into separate vectors `odd` and `even`, respectively. Finally, it prints the numbers in the `odd` vector followed by the numbers in the `even` vector.

Upon analyzing the code, we can identify a few potential areas for optimization:

1. Unnecessary includes: The code includes the entire `bits/stdc++.h` library, which is not recommended for production code. Instead, we can include only the necessary headers such as `<iostream>` and `<vector>`. This will reduce the compilation time and memory usage.

2. Input/Output operations: The code uses `cin` and `cout` for input/output operations. These operations are relatively slower compared to other methods such as `scanf` and `printf`. By replacing `cin` and `cout` with `scanf` and `printf`, we can improve the performance of the program.

3. Dynamic array allocation: The code uses a dynamic array `arr` to store the input integers. Dynamic memory allocation can be expensive in terms of both time and memory. Instead, we can use a `std::vector<int>` to dynamically resize the array as needed.

4. Redundant loop: The code uses a loop to iterate over the input array and store odd and even numbers in separate vectors. However, this can be done in a single pass by using the `std::partition` algorithm from the `<algorithm>` header. This will reduce the number of iterations and improve efficiency.

5. Unnecessary if-else condition: The code checks if the size of the `odd` vector is greater than or equal to the size of the `even` vector. If true, it prints the `odd` vector followed by the `even` vector. Otherwise, it prints the `even` vector followed by the `odd` vector. This condition can be simplified by using the `std::rotate` algorithm to rotate the vector if the size of the `odd` vector is smaller than the size of the `even` vector.

Based on these observations, let's optimize the code step by step.
