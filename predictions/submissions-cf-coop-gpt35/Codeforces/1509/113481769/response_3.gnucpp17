Upon analyzing the given code, I have identified the following potential areas for optimization:

1. Input/Output Optimization: The code uses `cin` and `cout` for input and output operations. These operations can be slow due to synchronization with C standard I/O streams. We can improve performance by adding the following line at the beginning of the `main` function:
   ```cpp
   ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
   cin.tie(NULL);
   ```
   This will disable the synchronization between C and C++ streams, resulting in faster I/O operations.

2. Dynamic Memory Allocation: The code uses a dynamic array `int arr[n]` to store the input values. Dynamic memory allocation can be slow, especially for large arrays. We can use a static array or a vector to avoid dynamic memory allocation. Since the size of the array is known at compile time, using a static array will be more efficient. We can replace `int arr[n]` with `int arr[100000]` (assuming the maximum size of `n` is 100,000).

3. Unnecessary Vector Creation: The code creates two vectors (`odd` and `even`) to store odd and even numbers separately. This is not necessary and can be optimized. Instead of storing the numbers in separate vectors, we can print them directly in the correct order. This will save memory and eliminate the need for vector creation.

4. Loop Optimization: The loops used in the code can be optimized further. The loop `for (int i : odd)` and `for (int i : even)` use range-based loops, which introduce additional overhead compared to traditional for loops. We can replace these loops with traditional for loops to improve performance.
