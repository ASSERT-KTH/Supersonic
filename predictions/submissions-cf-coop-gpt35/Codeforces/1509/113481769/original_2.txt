Code Analysis:

1. The code reads an integer `te` which represents the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, the code reads an integer `n` and an array `arr` of size `n`.
3. The code then separates the array elements into two vectors, `odd` and `even`, based on whether the element is odd or even.
4. Finally, the code prints the elements of the `odd` vector followed by the elements of the `even` vector.

Potential performance bottlenecks and inefficient memory usage:
1. The code uses the `vector` container to store the odd and even elements separately. However, this approach involves dynamic memory allocation and can result in frequent reallocation and copying of elements, leading to inefficient memory usage.
2. The code uses a range-based loop to print the elements of the `odd` and `even` vectors. While this is convenient, it incurs some overhead due to the use of iterators and range checks.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Efficient Data Structures: Instead of using two separate vectors, we can use two arrays to store the odd and even elements. This eliminates the need for dynamic memory allocation and reduces memory usage.
2. Redundant Computations: There are no redundant computations in the current code.
3. Loop Optimization: The current code uses a range-based loop to print the elements of the vectors. We can optimize this by using a regular for loop with an index variable. Additionally, we can use the `'\n'` character instead of `endl` to avoid flushing the output buffer after each test case.
4. Compiler Optimizations: We can enable compiler optimizations by passing appropriate flags to the compiler. However, this is outside the scope of the code itself and depends on the specific compiler and build system being used.

Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. Replace the `vector<int>` declarations with array declarations:
```cpp
int odd[n];
int even[n];
```
Rationale: Using arrays instead of vectors eliminates the need for dynamic memory allocation and reduces memory usage. Since the size of the arrays is known at compile-time, they can be allocated on the stack.

2. Modify the loop to store odd and even elements in the arrays:
```cpp
int oddIdx = 0;
int evenIdx = 0;
loop(i, n) {
  cin >> arr[i];
  if (arr[i] % 2) {
    odd[oddIdx++] = arr[i];
  } else {
    even[evenIdx++] = arr[i];
  }
}
```
Rationale: Instead of using `push_back` to add elements to the vectors, we can directly assign the elements to the corresponding indices of the arrays. This avoids dynamic memory allocation and copying of elements.

3. Optimize the printing loop:
```cpp
if (oddIdx >= evenIdx) {
  loop(i, oddIdx) {
    cout << odd[i] << ' ';
  }
  loop(i, evenIdx) {
    cout << even[i] << ' ';
  }
} else {
  loop(i, evenIdx) {
    cout << even[i] << ' ';
  }
  loop(i, oddIdx) {
    cout << odd[i] << ' ';
  }
}
cout << '\n';
```
Rationale: By using a regular for loop with an index variable, we avoid the overhead of iterators and range checks. Additionally, using the `'\n'` character instead of `endl` avoids unnecessary flushing of the output buffer after each test case.

Optimized Code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

#define IOS ios::sync_with_stdio(0); cin.tie(0); cout.tie(0);
#define frfr freopen("input.txt", "r", stdin);
#define loop(i, n) for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
#define ll long long int

void solve(int te) {
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  int arr[n];
  int odd[n];
  int even[n];
  int oddIdx = 0;
  int evenIdx = 0;
  loop(i, n) {
    cin >> arr[i];
    if (arr[i] % 2) {
      odd[oddIdx++] = arr[i];
    } else {
      even[evenIdx++] = arr[i];
    }
  }
  if (oddIdx >= evenIdx) {
    loop(i, oddIdx) {
      cout << odd[i] << ' ';
    }
    loop(i, evenIdx) {
      cout << even[i] << ' ';
    }
  } else {
    loop(i, evenIdx) {
      cout << even[i] << ' ';
    }
    loop(i, oddIdx) {
      cout << odd[i] << ' ';
    }
  }
  cout << '\n';
}

int main() {
  IOS;
  int te;
  cin >> te;
  for (int i = 1; i <= te; ++i) {
    solve(i);
  }
  return 0;
}
```

The optimized code minimizes memory usage by replacing vectors with arrays and uses a regular for loop for printing elements. It preserves the functionality and output of the original code while improving performance.
