Analysis:
- The code reads an integer `te` from the input, which represents the number of test cases.
- For each test case, it reads an integer `n` from the input, followed by an array of `n` integers.
- The code separates the elements of the array into two vectors: `odd` and `even`, based on whether the elements are odd or even.
- Finally, it prints the elements of `odd` followed by the elements of `even`, or vice versa, depending on which vector has more elements.

Potential optimizations:
1. Avoid using the `bits/stdc++.h` header: This header includes all the standard library headers, which can lead to longer compilation times and increased memory usage. Instead, include only the necessary headers.
2. Avoid using `std::endl`: `std::endl` not only inserts a newline character but also flushes the output buffer. Flushing the buffer after every output operation can be costly. Instead, use `'\n'` to insert a newline character.
3. Avoid using `std::vector` for temporary storage: Using `std::vector` for `odd` and `even` vectors can introduce unnecessary memory allocations and deallocations. Since the size of the vectors is known in advance, using fixed-size arrays can be more efficient.
4. Optimize the loop for separating odd and even numbers: Instead of pushing elements into separate vectors, we can keep track of the counts of odd and even numbers. Then, iterate over the input array and directly print the elements based on their parity, without the need for additional vectors.
5. Use `std::array` instead of a variable-length array: The use of a variable-length array (`int arr[n]`) is not standard C++. Instead, use `std::array<int, n>` for better code clarity and compatibility.

Optimization steps:
1. Remove unnecessary headers and replace `std::endl` with `'\n'`.
2. Replace `std::vector<int>` with fixed-size arrays for `odd` and `even`.
3. Modify the loop for separating odd and even numbers to count the occurrences of odd and even numbers.
4. Modify the loop for printing the elements to directly print the elements based on their parity.
5. Replace the variable-length array `int arr[n]` with `std::array<int, n>`.

Optimized code:

#include <array>

  std::cout.tie(nullptr);

void solve(int te) {
  int n;

  std::array<int, 100000> arr;
  int oddCount = 0;
  int evenCount = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    std::cin >> arr[i];
    if (arr[i] % 2) {
      oddCount++;
    } else {
      evenCount++;
    }
  }
  if (oddCount >= evenCount) {
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      if (arr[i] % 2) {
        std::cout << arr[i] << " ";
      }
    }
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      if (arr[i] % 2 == 0) {
        std::cout << arr[i] << " ";
      }
    }
  } else {
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      if (arr[i] % 2 == 0) {
        std::cout << arr[i] << " ";
      }
    }
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      if (arr[i] % 2) {
        std::cout << arr[i] << " ";
      }

  }
  std::cout << '\n';
}

int main() {
  IOS;
  int te;
  std::cin >> te;
  for (int i = 1; i <= te; ++i) {
    solve(i);
  }
  return 0;
}

This optimized code reduces memory usage by replacing `std::vector` with fixed-size arrays and avoids unnecessary memory allocations. It also improves performance by directly printing elements based on their parity instead of first storing them in separate vectors. Additionally, it uses `std::array` instead of a variable-length array for better code compatibility and clarity.
