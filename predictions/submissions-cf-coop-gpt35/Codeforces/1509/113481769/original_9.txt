Code Analysis:
1. The code reads an integer `n` from input, followed by an array of `n` integers.
2. It separates the odd and even numbers from the array into two separate vectors.
3. It then prints the numbers from the `odd` vector first, followed by the numbers from the `even` vector.
4. This process is repeated for `te` test cases.

Potential optimizations:
1. The code uses vectors to store the odd and even numbers separately. This requires dynamic memory allocations and deallocations, which can be inefficient.
2. The code uses a separate loop to print the numbers from the `even` vector after printing the numbers from the `odd` vector. This can be combined into a single loop to improve efficiency.
3. The code uses the `endl` constant to print a newline character. Using `'\n'` instead can be more efficient.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Replace the usage of vectors with fixed-size arrays to avoid dynamic memory allocations and deallocations.
2. Combine the loops for printing the numbers from both vectors into a single loop.
3. Replace the usage of `endl` with `'\n'`.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Replace the vector `odd` with a fixed-size array `oddArray` of size `n`.
   - Rationale: Using a fixed-size array avoids the overhead of dynamic memory allocations and deallocations. Since the size is known in advance, there is no need for a dynamic data structure like a vector.
   - Trade-offs: None. This change simplifies the code and improves efficiency.
2. Replace the vector `even` with a fixed-size array `evenArray` of size `n`.
   - Rationale: Similar to the previous step, using a fixed-size array avoids dynamic memory allocations and deallocations.
   - Trade-offs: None. This change simplifies the code and improves efficiency.
3. Combine the loops for filling the `oddArray` and `evenArray` into a single loop.
   - Rationale: This avoids iterating over the array twice and reduces the number of loop iterations.
   - Trade-offs: None. This change simplifies the code and improves efficiency.
4. Replace the usage of `endl` with `'\n'` for printing a newline character.
   - Rationale: The `endl` constant flushes the output stream, which can be expensive. Using `'\n'` instead only adds a newline character without unnecessary flushing.
   - Trade-offs: None. This change improves efficiency without affecting the functionality.

Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cstdio>
#define IOS \
  ios::sync_with_stdio(0); \
  cin.tie(0); \
  cout.tie(0);
using namespace std;

const int MAXN = 100000;
int oddArray[MAXN];
int evenArray[MAXN];

void solve(int te) {
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> arr[i];
    if (arr[i] % 2) {
      oddArray[i] = arr[i];
    } else {
      evenArray[i] = arr[i];
    }
  }

  if (n % 2 == 0) {
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      cout << evenArray[i] << " " << oddArray[i] << " ";
    }
  } else {
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      cout << oddArray[i] << " " << evenArray[i] << " ";
    }
  }
  cout << '\n';
}

int main() {
  IOS;
  int te;
  cin >> te;
  for (int i = 1; i <= te; ++i) {
    solve(i);
  }
  return 0;
}
```
This optimized code replaces the usage of vectors with fixed-size arrays and combines the loops for filling the arrays and printing the output. It also replaces the usage of `endl` with `'\n'` for better efficiency. These changes improve the code's performance by reducing unnecessary dynamic memory operations and reducing the number of loop iterations.
