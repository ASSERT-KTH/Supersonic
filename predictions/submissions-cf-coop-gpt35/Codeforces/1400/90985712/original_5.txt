Upon analyzing the provided code, I have identified the following potential areas for optimization:

1. Unnecessary Memory Initialization: The code initializes several arrays with zeros using `memset`. However, these arrays are immediately filled with values, rendering the `memset` calls unnecessary.

2. Unordered Set Operations: The code uses an unordered set to store unique values. However, the set is unnecessary as we can use a vector to achieve the same result. Using a vector will eliminate the need for set operations like insert and size.

3. Redundant Computations: The code performs redundant computations within nested loops. These computations can be avoided by storing the results in variables and reusing them when needed.

4. Loop Optimization: The code contains several nested loops that can potentially be optimized. For example, using a pre-calculated size variable instead of calling the size() function inside the loop can improve performance.

5. Compiler Optimization: Adding compiler optimizations, such as loop unrolling and enabling vectorization, may further enhance the performance of the code.

To optimize the code, I will make the following changes step by step.

Step 1: Remove unnecessary memory initialization
Since the arrays `has`, `dp`, `f`, and `f2` are immediately filled with values, we can remove the `memset` calls for these arrays.

Step 2: Replace unordered set with a vector
Instead of using an unordered set to store unique values, I will replace it with a vector. This will eliminate the need for set operations like insert and size.

Step 3: Eliminate redundant computations
To avoid redundant computations, I will store the results of repeated calculations in variables and reuse them when needed.

Step 4: Optimize loops
To optimize the loops, I will replace the calls to size() function with pre-calculated size variables wherever possible.

Step 5: Enable compiler optimizations
I will enable compiler optimizations, such as loop unrolling and vectorization, to further improve performance.

Now I will provide the optimized code with the changes mentioned above.
