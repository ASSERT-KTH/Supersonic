This code appears to be solving a graph problem, specifically finding the shortest path from a source node to a destination node in a graph. The code reads the number of nodes, number of edges, and a time limit from the input. It then reads the edges and weights of the graph, and uses dynamic programming to find the shortest path.

Upon analysis of the code, we can identify several potential areas for optimization:

1. Inefficient data structures: The code uses a vector of pairs to represent the adjacency list, a vector of vectors to represent the dp array, and a vector of vectors to represent the par array. These data structures can be optimized to reduce memory usage and improve cache efficiency.

2. Unnecessary computations: The code uses a nested loop to iterate through all possible nodes and edges to update the dp array. However, this can be optimized to only consider the relevant nodes and edges based on the current state of the dp array.

3. Redundant reverse and reverse iterator usage: The code uses the `reverse` function to reverse the order of the ans vector, and then uses a reverse iterator to iterate through the vector. This can be optimized to use a forward iterator instead.

4. Inefficient sorting: The `remDup` function uses the `sort` function to sort the vector, which is unnecessary since the vector is already sorted. This sorting operation can be removed.

5. Unnecessary function calls: The code defines several functions that are not used in the main program. These functions can be removed to simplify the code.

Based on these observations, the following optimization strategy can be formulated:

1. Replace the vector of pairs with a more efficient data structure, such as a vector of vectors or a custom adjacency list class.

2. Optimize the nested loop that updates the dp array to only consider relevant nodes and edges.

3. Replace the reverse and reverse iterator usage with a forward iterator.

4. Remove the unnecessary sorting operation in the `remDup` function.

5. Remove the unused functions to simplify the code.

Let's now proceed with step-by-step explanation and provide the optimized code.
