The given code is a C++ program that solves a graph problem. The program reads an input graph and finds the shortest path from node 1 to node n, considering a time constraint T. The program uses a modified version of Dijkstra's algorithm to solve this problem.

Upon analyzing the code, several potential optimizations can be identified:

1. Unnecessary Header File Inclusion: The code includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header file, which is not a standard C++ header file. It is recommended to include only the necessary standard headers instead of relying on non-standard headers.

2. Redundant Macros: The code defines several macros that are not used in the program. These macros can be removed to simplify the code.

3. Redundant Functions: The code defines several functions that are not used in the program. These functions can be removed to reduce code complexity.

4. Inefficient Data Structures: The code uses vectors of vectors to represent the adjacency list, dp table, and parent table. This can be memory-intensive and may result in cache misses. Using a more efficient data structure, such as a flat vector or a 1D array, can reduce memory usage and improve cache locality.

5. Inefficient Loop Nesting: The code uses nested loops to iterate over the adjacency list and update the dp and parent tables. This can result in redundant iterations and unnecessary comparisons. Unrolling the loops or restructuring the code can potentially improve performance.

6. Unnecessary Sorting: The code sorts the adjacency list and the ans vector. However, the sorting is not necessary for the given problem. Removing the sorting operations can improve running time.

7. Lack of Compiler Optimizations: The code does not make use of any compiler optimizations. Enabling compiler optimizations, such as loop unrolling, vectorization, and function inlining, can significantly improve performance.

Based on these observations, the following optimization strategy can be formulated:

1. Remove the unnecessary header file inclusion.
2. Remove the redundant macros and functions.
3. Replace the vector of vectors data structures with more memory-efficient alternatives.
4. Optimize the loop nesting and remove unnecessary iterations.
5. Remove the unnecessary sorting operations.
6. Enable compiler optimizations.

Let's now proceed with implementing these optimizations step-by-step.
