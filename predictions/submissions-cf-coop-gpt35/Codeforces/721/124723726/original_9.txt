The given code appears to be solving a graph problem using dynamic programming. However, there are several areas where improvements can be made to optimize the code:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The code includes the entire `<bits/stdc++.h>` header, which is not recommended and can lead to increased compilation time. Only include the necessary headers for the code.

2. Remove unnecessary macros: The code defines several macros that are not used in the code. These macros should be removed to avoid confusion and unnecessary preprocessing.

3. Avoid unnecessary vector copies: The code uses the `all()` macro to copy vectors unnecessarily. Instead, the vector should be passed by reference to avoid unnecessary copying.

4. Use `reserve()` to optimize vector memory allocation: The code uses vectors extensively. By using the `reserve()` function, we can allocate memory for the vectors in advance, reducing the number of reallocations and improving performance.

5. Use `emplace_back()` instead of `push_back()`: The code uses `push_back()` to add elements to vectors. By using `emplace_back()`, we can avoid unnecessary copying or moving of elements, resulting in improved performance.

6. Use references instead of passing by value: The code passes vectors by value to functions. By passing vectors by reference, we can avoid unnecessary copying and improve performance.

7. Avoid unnecessary sorting: The code uses the `sort()` function unnecessarily in the `remDup()` function. Since the vector is already sorted, we can use the `unique()` function directly without sorting, resulting in improved performance.

8. Use `const` references in comparison functions: The comparison functions used in `sort()` should take `const` references as parameters to avoid unnecessary copying.

9. Optimize the nested loops: The nested loops in the `solve()` function can be optimized by rearranging the loops and avoiding unnecessary iterations.

10. Use prefix increment instead of postfix increment: The code uses postfix increment (`i++`) in the loops. By using prefix increment (`++i`), we can avoid the overhead of creating a temporary copy of the variable.

11. Optimize memory usage: The code uses a 2D vector to store the dynamic programming table. Since only the previous row is required for computation, we can optimize memory usage by using two 1D vectors instead.

Based on these observations, let's optimize the code step by step.
