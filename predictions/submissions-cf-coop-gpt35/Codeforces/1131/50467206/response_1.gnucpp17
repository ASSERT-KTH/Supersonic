After analyzing the provided code, I have identified several potential areas for optimization:

1. Memory Usage:
   - The code currently uses two separate arrays, `height` and `cost`, to store the height and cost values for each block. This can be optimized by using a single array of structures or pairs to store both values together. This will reduce the memory overhead and improve cache locality.
   - The code also uses a 2D vector, `heightsOfBlock` and `costsOfBlock`, to store the heights and costs of each block. Instead of using a vector of vectors, we can use a single vector of structures or pairs to store both values together. This will reduce the memory overhead and improve cache locality.

2. Loop Optimization:
   - The inner loop in the main function iterates over all the blocks and their heights and costs. Since the inner loop is not dependent on the outer loop, we can use loop unrolling to process multiple elements at a time. This can improve the efficiency of memory access and reduce loop overhead.

3. Compiler Optimizations:
   - We can use compiler optimizations such as loop unrolling, function inlining, and auto-vectorization to improve the efficiency of the code. These optimizations can be enabled by using appropriate compiler flags or pragmas.
