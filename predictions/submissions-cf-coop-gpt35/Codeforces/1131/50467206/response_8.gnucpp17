The given code appears to implement the Bellman-Ford algorithm for finding the shortest path in a graph. However, there are several areas where the code can be optimized for efficiency:

1. Unnecessary Vector Initialization: The code initializes two vectors, `heightsOfBlock` and `costsOfBlock`, with size `N+1`. However, these vectors are cleared immediately after the loop, rendering the initializations unnecessary. Removing these initializations will save memory and improve performance.

2. Redundant Loop: The loop `for (int j = 1; j <= K; ++j)` is used twice to read the input values for `heightsOfBlock` and `costsOfBlock`. This loop can be combined into a single loop to read both values at once, eliminating the need for two separate loops.

3. Unnecessary Clearing of Vectors: After using `heightsOfBlock` and `costsOfBlock`, the code clears these vectors using the `clear()` function. Since these vectors are no longer used, clearing them is unnecessary and can be removed.

4. Inefficient Data Structure: The code uses a vector of pairs, `stackPushLeft`, to store the minimum values. However, using a deque instead of a vector would be more efficient, as it allows for efficient insertion and deletion at both ends.

5. Redundant Check in Loop Condition: The condition `((idx = stackPushRight.back().first) || true)` in the loop condition is redundant and can be removed. The loop can be simplified to `while (stackPushRight.size() && stackPushRight.back().first + height[stackPushRight.back().first] - 1 < i)`.

6. Optimization with Compiler Directives: The code currently includes a compiler directive `#if 1`, which enables debug output. This directive can be changed to `#if 0` to disable the debug output, which can improve performance.
