Code Analysis:
- The code calculates the number of sequences of length m that can be formed using digits 0 to 9. The sequences can have repeating digits, but there is a restriction that the digit 9 cannot appear consecutively in the sequence.
- The code uses a dynamic programming approach to calculate the number of sequences for different lengths and digits.
- The code then takes input in the form of a string and an integer, and calculates the sum of the corresponding values from the dp array for each digit in the string.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Efficient Data Structures: 
   - The dp array is currently a 2D array of size 11xN, where N = 200005. This results in a large memory usage. We can optimize this by using a 1D array of size 11 and updating the values in place.
2. Redundant Computation:
   - The dp array is initially filled with 1 for all digits at index 0. We can avoid this computation by initializing the dp array with 1 and starting the loops from index 1.
3. Loop Optimization:
   - The outer loop iterates from 0 to 9, and the inner loop iterates from 1 to 200005. This can be optimized by swapping the loops, i.e., the outer loop should iterate over j and the inner loop should iterate over i.
4. Compiler Optimizations:
   - We can use compiler optimizations to improve the performance of the code. We can enable compiler optimizations by adding appropriate flags, such as -O2, while compiling the code.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Efficient Data Structures:
   - Replace the 2D dp array with a 1D dp array of size 11.
   - The index of the dp array will represent the digit, and the value at that index will store the number of sequences for that digit.
   - This optimization reduces the memory usage by a factor of N.
2. Redundant Computation:
   - Remove the loop that initializes the dp array with 1 for all digits at index 0.
   - Instead, initialize the dp array with 1 for all indices.
   - This optimization eliminates redundant computations and reduces the number of iterations in the loop.
3. Loop Optimization:
   - Swap the outer and inner loops, i.e., iterate over j in the outer loop and i in the inner loop.
   - This optimization reduces cache misses and improves the efficiency of memory access.
4. Compiler Optimizations:
   - Enable compiler optimizations by adding appropriate flags, such as -O2, while compiling the code.
   - This optimization allows the compiler to automatically apply various optimizations, such as loop unrolling, instruction reordering, and constant folding.

Optimized Code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;
#define ll long long
const int MOD = 1e9 + 7;
const int N = 2 * 1e5 + 10;
ll dp[11];

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  
  // Initialize dp array with 1 for all indices
  for (ll i = 0; i <= 9; i++) {
    dp[i] = 1;
  }
  
  for (ll j = 1; j <= 200005; j++) {
    for (ll i = 0; i <= 9; i++) {
      if (i != 9)
        dp[i] = dp[i + 1];
      else
        dp[i] = (dp[0] + dp[1]) % MOD;
    }
  }
  
  ll t;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    string s;
    ll m;
    cin >> s >> m;
    ll ans = 0;
    for (ll i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
      ans = (ans + dp[s[i] - '0']) % MOD;
    }
    cout << ans << endl;
  }
  
  return 0;
}
```

In this optimized code:
- The dp array is now a 1D array of size 11, reducing memory usage.
- The initialization of the dp array with 1 at index 0 is removed, reducing redundant computation.
- The loops are swapped to improve memory access efficiency.
- Compiler optimizations can be enabled while compiling the code to further improve performance.
