Code Analysis:
- The code uses a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm to find a path from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner of a given maze represented by a 2D grid of characters.
- The maze is stored as an array of strings, with each string representing a row of the maze.
- The DFS function is implemented using recursion.
- The code uses a queue to store the coordinates of cells to be visited during the DFS traversal.
- The code also uses a boolean array to keep track of visited cells.

Potential Performance Bottlenecks:
1. Recursion: The use of recursion in the DFS function can lead to excessive function calls and stack memory usage, especially for large mazes.
2. Boolean Array: The boolean array "vis" is used to track visited cells, but it is not necessary to store the visited status for each cell. We can achieve the same result by marking a cell as visited directly in the maze grid.
3. String Operations: The code uses the "string" class for storing each row of the maze. However, since the maze consists of only two characters ('#' and '.'), we can use a more memory-efficient data structure to represent the maze.
4. Unnecessary Loop: The DFS function checks if the current cell is the bottom-right corner of the maze on every recursive call. This check can be moved outside the function to avoid unnecessary computations.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Replace the use of recursion in the DFS function with an iterative approach using a stack.
2. Replace the boolean array "vis" with direct marking of visited cells in the maze grid.
3. Use a more memory-efficient data structure (e.g., a 2D array of characters) to represent the maze.
4. Move the check for the bottom-right corner of the maze outside the DFS function.
5. Consider using compiler optimizations (e.g., optimization flags or pragma directives) to help the compiler generate more efficient code.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Replace the use of recursion in the DFS function with an iterative approach using a stack:
   - Create a stack of pairs to store the coordinates of cells to be visited.
   - Push the starting cell (0, 0) onto the stack.
   - While the stack is not empty:
     - Pop the top cell from the stack.
     - If the cell is the bottom-right corner of the maze, return true.
     - Mark the cell as visited in the maze grid.
     - Check the adjacent cells (down and right):
       - If a cell is within the maze bounds, not a wall ('#'), and not visited:
         - Push the cell onto the stack.
   - If the stack becomes empty and the bottom-right corner is not reached, return false.

2. Replace the boolean array "vis" with direct marking of visited cells in the maze grid:
   - Instead of using the boolean array "vis", mark a cell as visited directly in the maze grid by replacing the '.' character with a special character (e.g., '*').

3. Use a more memory-efficient data structure to represent the maze:
   - Replace the array of strings with a 2D array of characters to represent the maze grid.
   - Use the character '#' to represent walls and '.' to represent empty cells.

4. Move the check for the bottom-right corner of the maze outside the DFS function:
   - After the DFS function call, check if the bottom-right cell of the maze is marked as visited.
   - If it is visited, output 2. Otherwise, continue with the original logic of checking if the starting cell (0, 0) is visited.

5. Consider using compiler optimizations:
   - Add compiler optimization flags or pragma directives to inform the compiler about the hot path in the code (e.g., the DFS function) and enable optimizations.
