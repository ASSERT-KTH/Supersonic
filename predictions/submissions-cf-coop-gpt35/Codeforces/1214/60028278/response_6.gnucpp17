Code Analysis:
- The code reads in a grid of characters, where '#' represents a blocked cell and '.' represents an open cell.
- The goal is to check if there exists a path from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner of the grid, only moving right or down.
- The code uses a recursive depth-first search (DFS) approach to solve this problem.
- It keeps track of visited cells using a boolean array `vis`.
- The function `dfs` checks if a cell is valid and not visited, and recursively explores its right and down neighbors.

Potential Performance Bottlenecks:
1. Memory Usage: The `vis` array has a size of `n * m`, which can be large for larger grid sizes. This could lead to high memory usage.
2. Redundant Computations: The code calls `dfs` twice with the same starting coordinates.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Use a Bitset: Instead of using a boolean array `vis` to track visited cells, use a `bitset` to reduce memory usage.
2. Remove Redundant Computation: Remove the second call to `dfs` with the same starting coordinates.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Replace the `bool vis[maxn]` declaration with `bitset<maxn> vis` to reduce memory usage. This will change the type of `vis` from a boolean array to a bitset.
2. Remove the second call to `dfs(0, 0)` after setting `vis[0] = 0`. Since `dfs` is already called once at the beginning, the second call is redundant.
