The provided code calculates the number of peaks and valleys in a given array `a`. A peak is defined as an element that is greater than its adjacent elements, while a valley is defined as an element that is smaller than its adjacent elements. The code uses a brute force approach to calculate the count of peaks and valleys.

Here is the optimization strategy for improving the performance and memory usage of the code:

1. Remove unnecessary header file inclusion: The code includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header file, which is not a standard C++ header file and includes a large number of other header files. Since the code doesn't use any specific features from this header file, it can be removed.

2. Avoid using `using namespace std;`: The code uses the `using namespace std;` directive, which brings all names from the `std` namespace into the global namespace. This can lead to naming conflicts and is generally considered bad practice. Instead, it is better to use the `std::` prefix when using names from the `std` namespace.

3. Use pass-by-reference for the vector parameter: The `kitne` function takes a vector `a` as a parameter, but it is passed by value. This means that a copy of the vector is made every time the function is called, which can be expensive for large vectors. To avoid this unnecessary copying, the vector should be passed by reference.

4. Use prefix increment/decrement operators: In the `kitne` function, the loop variable `i` is incremented/decremented using the postfix increment/decrement operators. The prefix increment/decrement operators are more efficient as they don't involve creating a temporary copy of the variable.

5. Avoid unnecessary if conditions: In the `kitne` function, the loop variable `i` is checked against the size of the vector in each iteration of the loop. This check is unnecessary, as the loop condition already ensures that `i` is within the valid range.

6. Minimize repeated function calls: In the `hn_bhai` function, the `kitne` function is called twice for each value of `i`. Instead, the value of `kitne(i)` can be stored in a variable and reused.

7. Minimize unnecessary vector element assignments: In the `hn_bhai` function, the value of `a[i]` is assigned to `a[i-1]` and `a[i+1]` in each iteration of the loop. This involves unnecessary vector element assignments. Instead, the value of `a[i]` can be stored in a temporary variable and reused.

8. Use `reserve` instead of `resize` for vector initialization: In the `hn_bhai` function, the vector `a` is resized to `n` before reading the elements from input. This involves unnecessary memory reallocation and copying. Instead, the `reserve` function can be used to allocate the required memory in advance.

9. Use `emplace_back` instead of `push_back`: In the `hn_bhai` function, the elements of the vector `a` are read from input using `push_back`. This involves creating temporary objects and copying them into the vector. Instead, the `emplace_back` function can be used to construct the objects directly in the vector.

10. Avoid repeated computation of the same condition: In the `hn_bhai` function, the condition `(a[i] > a[i + 1] && a[i] > a[i - 1]) || (a[i] < a[i - 1] && a[i] < a[i + 1])` is checked twice for each value of `i`. Instead, the condition can be checked once and the result stored in a variable.

11. Use more descriptive variable names: The variable names used in the code are not very descriptive. Using more meaningful variable names can improve code readability.

Now, let's incorporate these optimizations into the code:
