Upon analyzing the given code, a few potential performance bottlenecks and areas for optimization can be identified:

1. Inefficient data structure: The `set<ll> st` is being used to store the hash values of strings. However, using a `set` incurs a performance cost due to its underlying implementation as a binary search tree.

2. Redundant computation: The `f` array is being computed for every test case. Since the array `f` remains the same for all test cases, it can be precomputed once and reused.

3. Inefficiencies in the hashing function: The hashing function currently uses a loop to compute the hash value. This can be optimized by using the Horner's method for polynomial evaluation.

4. Inefficient loop structure: The nested loop structure in the `check` function can be optimized by reducing the number of iterations and avoiding redundant computations.

To optimize the code, the following steps can be taken:

1. Replace the `set<ll>` data structure with a more efficient one, such as an `unordered_set<ll>`. This will improve the performance of the `insert` and `find` operations.

2. Precompute the `f` array in the `init` function before reading the test cases. This will eliminate redundant computations for each test case.

3. Optimize the `get_hash` function by using the Horner's method for polynomial evaluation. This involves iterating over the characters of the string in reverse order and updating the hash value accordingly.

4. Optimize the nested loop structure in the `check` function. Instead of iterating over all characters in the string and all possible characters ('a' to 'c'), we can iterate over only the characters in the string and check if the hash value, computed by replacing the current character with 'a', 'b', and 'c', exists in the set. This will reduce the number of iterations and avoid redundant computations.

Here's the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_set>
using namespace std;

typedef long long ll;
const int base = 257;
const int mod = 1e9 + 7;
const int N = 1e6;

unordered_set<ll> st;
ll f[N];

void init() {
  f[0] = 1;
  for (int i = 1; i < N; i++)
    f[i] = f[i - 1] * base % mod;
}

ll get_hash(string s) {
  ll val = 0;
  for (int i = s.size() - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
    val = (val * base + s[i]) % mod;
  }
  return val;
}

bool check(string t) {
  ll val = get_hash(t);
  for (int i = 0; i < t.size(); i++) {
    for (char j = 'a'; j <= 'c'; j++) {
      if (j != t[i]) {
        ll diff = (j - t[i] + mod) % mod;
        ll new_val = (diff * f[t.size() - i - 1] + val) % mod;
        if (st.find(new_val) != st.end())
          return true;
      }
    }
  }
  return false;
}

int main() {
#ifdef DEBUG
  freopen("F:\\data.in", "r", stdin);
  freopen("F:\\data.out", "w", stdout);
#endif
#ifdef CANCEL
  std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  std::cin.tie(0);
#endif
  init();
  int n, m;
  cin >> n >> m;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    string s;
    cin >> s;
    st.insert(get_hash(s));
  }
  for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
    string t;
    cin >> t;
    cout << (check(t) ? "YES" : "NO") << endl;
  }
#ifdef DEBUG
  fclose(stdin);
  fclose(stdout);
#endif
  return 0;
}
```

By implementing these optimizations, the code's performance and memory usage should be significantly improved.
