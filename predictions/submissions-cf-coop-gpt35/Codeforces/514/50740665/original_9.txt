The given code appears to be a program that checks if a given string `t` can be formed by substituting any character in the string with one of the characters 'a', 'b', or 'c'. The program reads an input of `n` strings and stores their hashes in a set `st`. It then reads `m` strings and checks if each string can be formed using the substitution rule. The result is printed as "YES" if the string can be formed and "NO" otherwise.

Upon analyzing the code, the following potential areas for optimization can be identified:

1. Unnecessary header inclusion: The `#include <bits\stdc++.h>` header includes the entire C++ standard library, which is unnecessary for this specific code. Only the required headers, such as `<iostream>`, should be included.

2. Redundant use of `typedef`: The `typedef long long ll;` statement is not necessary in this code as `ll` is not used.

3. Inefficient data structure: The `set<ll> st` is used to store the hashes of the input strings. However, a `unordered_set` would be more efficient in terms of lookup time.

4. Inefficient hash calculation: The `get_hash` function calculates the hash of a string by iterating over all characters and performing modular arithmetic. This can be optimized by using the Horner's method, which calculates the hash in a single pass.

5. Inefficient inner loop: The inner loop in the `check` function iterates over all characters in the string `t` and checks for each possible substitution. This can be optimized by using a lookup table instead of nested loops.

Based on these observations, the following optimization strategy can be formulated:

1. Remove the unnecessary header inclusion.
2. Remove the unnecessary `typedef`.
3. Replace the `set<ll>` with an `unordered_set<ll>`.
4. Optimize the `get_hash` function using Horner's method.
5. Optimize the inner loop in the `check` function using a lookup table.

Now, let's implement these optimizations step by step.
