Code Analysis:
- The code defines a struct `POINT` which represents a point in 2D space. It has member variables `x` and `y` representing the coordinates of the point.
- The code defines three overloaded operators (`+`, `-`, `!`) for the `POINT` struct to perform vector addition, subtraction, and rotation by 90 degrees.
- The code defines three inline functions(`dot`, `cross`) to calculate dot product and cross product of two points.
- The code defines another inline function `cross` which takes three points and calculates the cross product of the vectors formed by them.
- The code defines two more inline functions `halfPlane` and `angSortCmp` which are used for sorting the points in a counterclockwise manner.
- The code reads an integer `n` and a long long integer `S` from the input.
- It then reads `n` points from the input and stores them in an array `tab`.
- The code sorts the points in `tab` array based on their x-coordinate and then their y-coordinate.
- The code creates a vector `kol` to store all the possible directions between pairs of points.
- It then sorts the `kol` vector in counterclockwise order using the `angSortCmp` function.
- The code then performs a binary search on the `stab` array to find a point that forms a triangle with two other points such that the area of the triangle is equal to `S`.
- If such a point is found, the code prints "Yes" along with the three points and exits.
- If no such triangle is found, the code prints "No".

Potential Optimizations:
1. Use a more efficient sorting algorithm: The code currently uses the `std::sort` function to sort the `tab` array. This function has an average time complexity of O(n log n). However, since the points are already sorted based on their x-coordinate, we can use a linear time algorithm such as counting sort or radix sort to sort the points based on their y-coordinate. This would reduce the sorting time complexity from O(n log n) to O(n).
2. Optimize the binary search: The code performs two binary searches to find a point that forms a triangle with two other points. Instead of performing two separate binary searches, we can combine them into a single binary search. This would reduce the number of iterations and improve the overall performance.
3. Avoid unnecessary calculations: The code calculates the cross product of the same two points multiple times within the binary search loop. We can calculate it once and store it in a variable to avoid redundant calculations.
4. Use a more efficient data structure: The code uses an array `stab` and an array `poz` to store and manipulate the points during the binary search. Instead of using arrays, we can use a vector of points and a vector of indices. This would allow us to easily insert and swap elements without the need for manual bookkeeping of indices.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Replace the `std::sort` function with a counting sort or radix sort algorithm to sort the points based on their y-coordinate.
2. Combine the two binary searches into a single binary search and optimize the search loop.
3. Avoid redundant calculations by calculating the cross product only once and storing it in a variable.
4. Replace the arrays `stab` and `poz` with vectors to improve flexibility and eliminate the need for manual index tracking.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Replace the `std::sort` function with a counting sort or radix sort algorithm to sort the points based on their y-coordinate:
   - Instead of using the `std::sort` function, we can implement a counting sort or radix sort algorithm to sort the `tab` array based on the y-coordinate of the points.
   - Counting sort is a linear time sorting algorithm that can be used when the range of input values is known and relatively small. In this case, the y-coordinates of the points are integers, so counting sort can be used.
   - The counting sort algorithm works by counting the number of occurrences of each element and then using those counts to calculate the positions of each element in the sorted array.
   - Here's the modified code to use counting sort to sort the points based on their y-coordinate:
```cpp
// Counting sort to sort points based on y-coordinate
const int MAX_Y = 1000000; // Assuming the range of y-coordinates is within 0 to 1,000,000
vector<int> count(MAX_Y + 1, 0);
vector<POINT> sortedPoints(n + 1);
for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
  count[tab[i].y]++;
}
for (int i = 1; i <= MAX_Y; ++i) {
  count[i] += count[i - 1];
}
for (int i = n; i >= 1; --i) {
  sortedPoints[count[tab[i].y]] = tab[i];
  count[tab[i].y]--;
}
tab = sortedPoints;
```
2. Combine the two binary searches into a single binary search and optimize the search loop:
   - Currently, the code performs two separate binary searches to find a point that forms a triangle with two other points.
   - We can combine these two binary searches into a single binary search by checking both conditions within the same loop.
   - Additionally, we can optimize the search loop by using a while loop instead of a do-while loop and removing the unnecessary checks.
   - Here's the modified code with the combined and optimized binary search:
```cpp
// Combined and optimized binary search
int l = 1;
int r = n;
while (l <= r) {
  int s = (l + r) / 2;
  long long ww = cross(tab[q], stab[s], tab[p]);
  if (ww == S) {
    cout << "Yes" << endl;
    cout << tab[p].x << ' ' << tab[p].y << endl;
    cout << tab[q].x << ' ' << tab[q].y << endl;
    cout << stab[s].x << ' ' << stab[s].y << endl;
    exit(0);
  }
  if (ww > S) {
    r = s - 1;
  } else {
    l = s + 1;
  }
}
```
3. Avoid redundant calculations by calculating the cross product only once and storing it in a variable:
   - Currently, the code calculates the cross product of the same two points multiple times within the binary search loop.
   - We can calculate the cross product once and store it in a variable to avoid redundant calculations.
   - Here's the modified code with the cross product calculation stored in a variable:
```cpp
// Calculate cross product once and store it in a variable
long long crossProduct = cross(tab[q], stab[s], tab[p]);
if (crossProduct == S) {
  cout << "Yes" << endl;
  cout << tab[p].x << ' ' << tab[p].y << endl;
  cout << tab[q].x << ' ' << tab[q].y << endl;
  cout << stab[s].x << ' ' << stab[s].y << endl;
  exit(0);
}
if (crossProduct > S) {
  r = s - 1;
} else {
  l = s + 1;
}
```
4. Replace the arrays `stab` and `poz` with vectors to improve flexibility and eliminate the need for manual index tracking:
   - Instead of using arrays, we can use vectors to store and manipulate the points during the binary search.
   - Vectors provide dynamic resizing and automatic memory management, which makes it easier to insert and swap elements without the need for manual index tracking.
   - Here's the modified code with vectors replacing the arrays:
```cpp
// Replace arrays with vectors
vector<POINT> stab(tab.begin(), tab.end());
vector<int> poz(n + 1);
for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
  poz[i] = i;
}
```
