Code Analysis:

1. The code uses several unnecessary include statements, such as `#include <algorithm>`, `#include <bitset>`, `#include <cassert>`, etc. These should be removed to improve compilation time.

2. The code uses `using namespace std;`, which is generally discouraged as it can lead to naming conflicts. It is better to use the `std::` prefix for standard library functions and types.

3. The code uses a lot of global variables, which can make the code harder to understand and maintain. It is better to encapsulate these variables within a struct or class.

4. The code performs unnecessary calculations and checks. For example, in the inner loop, it calculates `Nx[j] * Yi - Ny[j] * Xi` twice for the same `j` value. This calculation can be moved outside the loop and stored in a variable.

5. In the inner loop, the code checks for two conditions: `t == S` and `t == -S`. Instead, it can check for `std::abs(t) == S`. This avoids the need for two separate comparisons.

6. The code has a lot of unnecessary type conversions. For example, `S` is multiplied by `2L` to convert it to a `int64` type. It would be more efficient to declare `S` as an `int64` from the beginning.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Remove unnecessary include statements.

2. Remove the `using namespace std;` statement.

3. Encapsulate global variables within a struct or class.

4. Move the calculation `Nx[j] * Yi - Ny[j] * Xi` outside the inner loop and store it in a variable.

5. Check for `std::abs(t) == S` instead of `t == S` and `t == -S`.

6. Declare `S` as an `int64` from the beginning.

Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. Remove unnecessary include statements:
   - Remove `#include <algorithm>`, `#include <bitset>`, `#include <cassert>`, `#include <cmath>`, `#include <cstdio>`, `#include <cstring>`, `#include <ctime>`, `#include <iostream>`, `#include <map>`, `#include <queue>`, `#include <set>`, `#include <sstream>`, `#include <string>`, and `#include <vector>`.

2. Remove the `using namespace std;` statement:
   - Replace `using namespace std;` with `using std::cin;`, `using std::cout;`, `using std::abs;`, `using std::endl;`, `using std::pair;`, `using std::vector;`, `using std::string;`, `using std::make_pair;`, `using std::bitset;`, `using std::map;`, `using std::queue;`, `using std::set;`, `using std::stringstream;`, `using std::max;`, `using std::min;`, and `using std::swap;`.

3. Encapsulate global variables within a struct or class:
   - Create a struct or class to encapsulate the global variables `x`, `y`, `Nx`, `Ny`, `A`, `mod`, `nx`, `ny`, and `a`.

4. Move the calculation `Nx[j] * Yi - Ny[j] * Xi` outside the inner loop and store it in a variable:
   - Before the inner loop, declare a variable `int64 t = Nx[j] * Yi - Ny[j] * Xi;`.
   - Use `t` in the inner loop instead of recalculating `Nx[j] * Yi - Ny[j] * Xi`.

5. Check for `std::abs(t) == S` instead of `t == S` and `t == -S`:
   - Replace `if (t == S || t == -S)` with `if (std::abs(t) == S)`.

6. Declare `S` as an `int64` from the beginning:
   - Change the declaration of `S` from `int64 S;` to `int64_t S;`.

Optimized Code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <cmath>

struct Point {
  int64_t x;
  int64_t y;
};

struct Triangle {
  Point p1;
  Point p2;
  Point p3;
};

bool checkTriangle(const Point& p1, const Point& p2, const Point& p3, int64_t S) {
  int64_t Nx = p2.x - p1.x;
  int64_t Ny = p2.y - p1.y;
  int64_t Xi = p3.x - p1.x;
  int64_t Yi = p3.y - p1.y;
  int64_t t = Nx * Yi - Ny * Xi;
  if (std::abs(t) == S) {
    std::cout << "Yes\n";
    std::cout << p1.x << " " << p1.y << "\n";
    std::cout << p2.x << " " << p2.y << "\n";
    std::cout << p3.x << " " << p3.y << "\n";
    return true;
  }
  return false;
}

int main() {
  int n;
  int64_t S;
  std::cin >> n >> S;
  S *= 2L;
  std::vector<Point> points(n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    std::cin >> points[i].x >> points[i].y;
  }
  for (int s = 0; s < n; ++s) {
    for (int i = s + 1; i < n; ++i) {
      for (int j = i + 1; j < n; ++j) {
        if (checkTriangle(points[s], points[i], points[j], S)) {
          return 0;
        }
      }
    }
  }
  std::cout << "No\n";
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized code removes unnecessary include statements, avoids global variables, reduces unnecessary calculations, and improves code readability. It should provide better performance and memory usage compared to the original code.
