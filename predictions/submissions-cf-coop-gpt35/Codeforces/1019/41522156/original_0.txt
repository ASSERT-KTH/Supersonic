Code Analysis:

1. The code reads an integer `n` and a long long integer `S` from the input. It then reads `n` pairs of integers `x[i]` and `y[i]` from the input.
2. The code performs a nested loop to iterate over all possible combinations of three points from the given `n` points.
3. For each combination of three points, the code calculates the difference vectors `Nx` and `Ny` for the second and third points relative to the first point.
4. The code then checks if the cross product of `Nx` and `Ny` for each remaining point is equal to `S` or `-S`. If a match is found, it prints "Yes" followed by the coordinates of the three points and exits.
5. If no match is found, the code prints "No" and exits.

Potential Performance Bottlenecks:

1. The code uses nested loops to iterate over all possible combinations of three points. This has a time complexity of O(n^3).
2. The code performs redundant calculations of `Nx[j] * Yi - Ny[j] * Xi` for each remaining point. This calculation can be reused within the loop instead of recalculating it multiple times.
3. The code uses floating-point arrays `nx`, `ny`, and `a` to store intermediate results. Using floating-point numbers for integer calculations can introduce rounding errors and affect the accuracy of the results.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Replace the use of `float` with `int64` for `nx`, `ny`, and `a` arrays to ensure integer calculations and improve accuracy.
2. Move the calculation of `Nx[j] * Yi - Ny[j] * Xi` outside the inner loop and store it in a variable `t` to avoid redundant calculations.
3. Use a more efficient algorithm to find the three points that satisfy the condition, instead of checking all combinations of three points.
4. Remove unnecessary includes and pragmas.

Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. Remove unnecessary includes and pragmas, as they are not used in the given code.

2. Replace the use of `float` with `int64` for `nx`, `ny`, and `a` arrays. This change ensures integer calculations and improves accuracy.

3. Move the calculation of `Nx[j] * Yi - Ny[j] * Xi` outside the inner loop and store it in a variable `t` to avoid redundant calculations. This change reduces the number of calculations by reusing the result.

4. Use a more efficient algorithm to find the three points that satisfy the condition. Instead of checking all combinations of three points, we can use a hash set to store the calculated values of `t` and check if the complement (`S - t` or `-S - t`) exists in the set. This change reduces the time complexity from O(n^3) to O(n^2).

5. Update the code to print "Yes" and the coordinates of the three points directly when a match is found, instead of using a separate loop to print the points.

Optimized Code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_set>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;
typedef long long int64;

int main() {
  int n;
  int64 S;
  cin >> n >> S;
  S *= 2L;
  vector<int64> x(n), y(n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    cin >> x[i] >> y[i];
  }
  unordered_set<int64> hashSet;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    for (int j = i + 1; j < n; ++j) {
      int64 Nx = x[j] - x[i];
      int64 Ny = y[j] - y[i];
      int64 t = Nx * y[i] - Ny * x[i];
      if (hashSet.count(S - t) || hashSet.count(-S - t)) {
        cout << "Yes\n";
        cout << x[i] << " " << y[i] << "\n";
        cout << x[j] << " " << y[j] << "\n";
        for (int k = 0; k < n; ++k) {
          if (k != i && k != j) {
            if (Nx * y[k] - Ny * x[k] == S - t || Nx * y[k] - Ny * x[k] == -S - t) {
              cout << x[k] << " " << y[k] << "\n";
              break;
            }
          }
        }
        return 0;
      }
      hashSet.insert(t);
    }
  }
  cout << "No\n";
  return 0;
}
```

The optimized code reduces the time complexity from O(n^3) to O(n^2) and avoids redundant calculations. It also uses integer calculations instead of floating-point numbers for improved accuracy.
