Code Analysis:
- The code reads an integer `n` and a long long integer `S` from the input.
- It then reads `n` pairs of integers `x` and `y` from the input.
- The code performs a series of calculations to check if there exist three points in the given set that form a triangle with a specific area `S`.
- If such a triangle exists, the code outputs "Yes" followed by the coordinates of the three points. Otherwise, it outputs "No".

Potential optimization opportunities:
1. Loop optimization: There are multiple nested loops in the code that can potentially be optimized to reduce redundant computations.
2. Data structure optimization: The code uses arrays and vectors to store and manipulate data. It may be possible to use more efficient data structures to improve performance.
3. Floating-point arithmetic: The code uses floating-point numbers for some calculations. Floating-point arithmetic can be slower than integer arithmetic, and there may be opportunities to replace floating-point calculations with integer calculations.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Loop optimization:
   - The outer loop iterates from `s = 0` to `n-1`. Instead of initializing `Nx` and `Ny` arrays inside this loop, we can move the initialization outside the loop and reuse the arrays.
   - The inner loop iterates from `i = s+1` to `n-1`. Instead of performing the same calculations for `Nx[i]` and `Ny[i]` multiple times, we can calculate them once outside the loop and reuse the values.
   - The second inner loop iterates from `j = i+1` to `n-1`. We can optimize this loop by avoiding redundant calculations of `t` and by breaking out of the loop as soon as a matching triangle is found.
2. Data structure optimization:
   - The code uses a combination of arrays and vectors to store data. We can replace the arrays with vectors to improve memory management and simplify the code.
   - We can also use a vector of pairs to store the coordinates of the points instead of separate `x` and `y` arrays.
3. Floating-point arithmetic:
   - The code uses floating-point arrays `nx` and `ny` to store the normalized coordinates. We can replace these arrays with integer arrays to avoid the overhead of floating-point arithmetic.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Loop optimization:
   - Move the initialization of `Nx` and `Ny` arrays outside the outer loop.
   - Calculate `Nx[i]` and `Ny[i]` once outside the inner loop and reuse the values.
   - Avoid redundant calculations of `t` in the second inner loop.
   - Break out of the second inner loop as soon as a matching triangle is found.
2. Data structure optimization:
   - Replace the arrays `x` and `y` with a vector of pairs to store the coordinates of the points.
   - Replace the arrays `Nx`, `Ny`, `A`, and `mod` with vectors for better memory management.
   - Replace the floating-point arrays `nx` and `ny` with integer arrays.
3. Floating-point arithmetic:
   - Replace the floating-point arrays `nx` and `ny` with integer arrays to avoid the overhead of floating-point arithmetic.
