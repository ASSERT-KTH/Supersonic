Code Analysis:
1. The code reads an integer `n` and a long long integer `S` from the input.
2. It then reads `n` pairs of integer coordinates into the arrays `x` and `y`.
3. The code then iterates over each pair of points, calculating the differences in x and y coordinates between each pair of points and storing them in the arrays `Nx` and `Ny`.
4. For each pair of points, the code checks if there exists a third point such that the cross product of the differences in x and y coordinates between the second and third points is equal to `S` or `-S`. If such a point exists, it prints "Yes" followed by the coordinates of the three points and exits the program.
5. If no such points are found, the code prints "No" and exits.

Potential Performance Bottlenecks:
1. The code uses floating-point arrays `nx`, `ny`, and `a`, but they are not used for any calculations or output. This suggests that they may be unnecessary and can be removed to reduce memory usage.
2. The code iterates over every pair of points and checks if there exists a third point with a specific cross product. This results in a time complexity of O(n^3), which can be quite slow for large values of `n`.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Remove the unnecessary floating-point arrays `nx`, `ny`, and `a` to reduce memory usage.
2. Optimize the nested loops by reducing the number of iterations and avoiding redundant computations.
3. Use a more efficient algorithm to solve the problem, potentially reducing the time complexity.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Remove the unnecessary floating-point arrays `nx`, `ny`, and `a` from the code.
2. Replace the nested loops that iterate over each pair of points with a more efficient algorithm.
3. Use a set data structure to store the cross products of the differences in x and y coordinates between each pair of points. This will allow us to check if a specific cross product exists in O(1) time.
4. Iterate over each pair of points and calculate the differences in x and y coordinates between them, storing them in the arrays `Nx` and `Ny`.
5. For each pair of points, calculate the cross product and check if it exists in the set of cross products. If it does, print "Yes" followed by the coordinates of the three points and exit the program.
6. If no such points are found, print "No" and exit the program.

Trade-offs:
1. Removing the unnecessary floating-point arrays reduces memory usage but does not significantly impact performance.
2. The use of the set data structure increases memory usage but improves the efficiency of searching for specific cross products. This trade-off is acceptable since the set is only used for the specific purpose of checking if a cross product exists.
