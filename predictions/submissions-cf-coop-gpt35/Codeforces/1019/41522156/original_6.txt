Upon analyzing the given code, we can identify several potential areas for optimization:

1. Input/Output: The current code uses `cin` and `cout` for input and output operations, respectively. These operations are known to be slower compared to other methods, such as using `scanf` and `printf` in C or using `getline` and `cout` with `sync_with_stdio(false)` in C++. We can consider using these alternative methods to improve input/output performance.

2. Floating-Point Arithmetic: The code uses floating-point arithmetic for calculations involving coordinates and slopes. Floating-point arithmetic can be slower compared to integer arithmetic. We can try using integer arithmetic instead to improve performance.

3. Loop Optimization: There are nested loops in the code that iterate over the input data. We can consider optimizing these loops to reduce unnecessary iterations and improve performance.

4. Memory Usage: The code uses several arrays to store intermediate results. We can analyze the memory usage and identify opportunities to reduce memory usage and improve cache efficiency.

Based on these observations, let's proceed with the optimization strategy.
