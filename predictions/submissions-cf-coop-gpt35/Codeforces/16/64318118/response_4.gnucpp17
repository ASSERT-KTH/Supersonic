Upon analyzing the code, here are some potential optimizations that can be made:

1. Improve I/O efficiency: The code currently uses `cin` and `cout` for input and output. These functions are slower compared to other I/O methods. We can use `scanf` and `printf` for faster I/O.

2. Avoid unnecessary includes: The code includes the entire `<bits/stdc++.h>` header, which is not recommended. It is better to include only the necessary headers. In this case, we only need `<iostream>`, `<vector>`, `<algorithm>`, `<iomanip>`, and `<cmath>`.

3. Avoid using macros: Macros can lead to unexpected behavior and make the code harder to debug. It is better to use constants or inline functions instead of macros. For example, instead of `#define N 200005`, we can use `const int N = 200005;`.

4. Optimize the matrix initialization: The code initializes the matrix `m` with zeros using `vector<vector<double>> m(n, vector<double>(n, 0))`. However, we can improve the initialization by using a single vector and accessing elements using a 1D index instead of a 2D index.

5. Optimize loop indexing: The code uses nested loops to iterate over the matrix elements. Instead of using the `fore` and `fr` macros, we can use simple `for` loops with optimized indexing.

6. Optimize bitwise operations: The code uses bitwise operations to check if certain bits are set in an integer. Instead of repeatedly performing these operations, we can calculate the bits once and store them in a separate variable.

7. Use `double` instead of `long long` for calculations: The code uses `long long` for calculations, which can be slower compared to using `double` for this specific problem. We should change the `ll` type to `double` for variables such as `dp` and `m`.

8. Use a more efficient power of 2 calculation: The code uses `(1 << n)` to calculate the power of 2. However, this can be optimized using the `pow` function from `<cmath>`.

9. Optimize multiplication: The code performs multiplication using the `*` operator. We can optimize this by using the `*=`, `/=`, and `+=` operators instead.

10. Optimize precision setting: The code uses `fixed` and `setprecision` to set the precision for output. However, we can set the precision once before the loop, instead of for each iteration.
