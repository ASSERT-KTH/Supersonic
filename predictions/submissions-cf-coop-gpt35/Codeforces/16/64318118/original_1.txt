Upon analyzing the provided code, there are several potential optimizations that can be made to improve performance and reduce memory usage:

1. Removing unnecessary headers: The `<bits/stdc++.h>` header includes almost all other standard headers, which can increase compilation time and memory usage. Instead of including this header, we can include only the necessary headers such as `<iostream>`, `<vector>`, `<cmath>`, and `<iomanip>`.

2. Removing unused defines: The defines `_CRT_SECURE_NO_WARNINGS`, `_USE_MATH_DEFINES`, `N`, `FH`, `inf`, and `MOD` are defined but not used in the code. We can remove them to reduce clutter.

3. Avoiding unnecessary namespace usage: The `using namespace std;` directive brings all symbols from the `std` namespace into the current scope. This can lead to potential naming conflicts and may slow down the compilation process. It is better to explicitly use the `std` namespace for specific symbols, or use the `std::` prefix.

4. Avoiding unnecessary vector initialization: The vector `dp` is initialized with all zeros using `vector<double> dp(1 << n, 0)`. However, later in the code, the values of `dp` are updated using the `+=` operator. Hence, the initialization with zeros is redundant and can be removed.

5. Optimizing loop indices: The loop indices `j` and `k` in the nested loops `fore(j, 0, n) fore(k, j + 1, n)` can be optimized. Since `k` starts from `j + 1`, there is no need to iterate over the entire range of `n` for both `j` and `k`. Instead, we can modify the loops to `fore(j, 0, n-1) fore(k, j + 1, n)`.

6. Avoiding repeated calculations: The calculations `2 * dp[i] / (ruby * (ruby - 1))` and `m[j][k]` are repeated multiple times within the inner loop. We can calculate these values once and store them in variables to avoid redundant computations.

7. Using a more efficient data structure: The vector of vectors `m` is used to store the matrix data. However, since the matrix is symmetric, we can optimize memory usage by only storing the upper triangular part of the matrix and accessing the corresponding values when needed.

8. Adding compiler optimizations: We can use compiler optimizations to further improve performance. For example, we can use optimization flags such as `-O3` (for GCC) or specify pragma directives to hint the compiler to optimize the critical sections of the code.

Taking these optimizations into consideration, the optimized code can be as follows:
