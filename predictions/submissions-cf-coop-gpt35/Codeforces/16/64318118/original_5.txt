Upon analyzing the provided code, I have identified several potential areas for optimization:

1. Redundant includes: The code includes unnecessary headers such as "bits/stdc++.h" and "_USE_MATH_DEFINES". These headers are not being used in the code and can be removed.

2. Unnecessary macros: The macros for "N", "FH", "inf", and "MOD" are defined but not used in the code. These macros can be removed to improve code readability.

3. Inefficient data structure: The code uses a vector of vectors to represent a matrix. This can be replaced with a 1D array to improve memory efficiency and cache locality.

4. Suboptimal loop structure: The nested loops in the "fr" function can be optimized by using a single loop that counts down from the maximum value to the minimum value.

5. Redundant calculations: The calculations of "2 * dp[i] / (ruby * (ruby - 1))" are repeated multiple times. This calculation can be moved outside the loop to avoid redundant computations.

6. Lack of compiler optimizations: The code does not utilize any compiler optimizations or pragma directives. Adding appropriate compiler optimizations can help the compiler generate more efficient code.

Now, let's proceed with the step-by-step explanation of each optimization and provide the optimized code.
