The given code reads 4 integers from the user, sorts them in ascending order, and then counts the number of distinct integers among the 4 input values. The count is then printed as the output.

To optimize this code, we can make the following improvements:

1. Avoid using the `bits/stdc++.h` header: This header includes a large number of unnecessary standard library headers, which can slow down the compilation process. Instead, we should include only the necessary headers, such as `<iostream>` and `<algorithm>`.

2. Use a more efficient data structure: The code currently uses a simple array to store the input values. However, since we only need to count the number of distinct values, we can use a `std::set` or `std::unordered_set` to store the values. This will allow us to eliminate duplicates automatically without the need for sorting.

3. Optimize the loop conditions: The first loop iterates from 0 to 3, which means the loop runs 4 times. However, we only need to read 4 integers, so the loop should run from 0 to 3 (inclusive). Similarly, the second loop can run from 0 to 2 (inclusive) since we only need to compare the first 3 elements.

4. Optimize the distinct value count: The current approach subtracts 1 from `ans` for each pair of adjacent elements that are equal. However, we can simplify this logic by using a `std::unordered_set` to store the distinct values. We can insert each element into the set and then subtract the size of the set from 4 to get the count of distinct values.

Taking these optimizations into account, here's the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>
#include <unordered_set>

int main() {
  int mas[4], ans = 4;
  for (int i = 0; i < 4; ++i) {
    std::cin >> mas[i];
  }

  std::unordered_set<int> distinctValues;
  for (int i = 0; i < 3; ++i) {
    distinctValues.insert(mas[i]);
  }

  ans = 4 - distinctValues.size();
  std::cout << ans;

  return 0;
}
```

This optimized code eliminates the need for sorting and reduces the number of operations required to count the distinct values. By using an unordered set, we can achieve a linear time complexity of O(N) instead of O(NlogN) if we were to sort the array. The optimizations also simplify the code and make it more readable.
