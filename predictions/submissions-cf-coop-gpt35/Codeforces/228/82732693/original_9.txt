The provided code reads 4 integers from the user, sorts them in ascending order, and then counts the number of distinct integers. The count is stored in the variable `ans` and then printed to the console.

Here are the optimization steps that can be applied to improve the performance and memory usage of the code:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The code includes the entire `<bits/stdc++.h>` header, which is not necessary. We can remove it and only include the required headers, such as `<iostream>` and `<algorithm>`.

2. Replace the fixed-size array with a dynamically allocated array: The code currently uses a fixed-size array `mas[5]` to store the input integers. Since the number of integers is not known in advance, we can replace it with a dynamically allocated array using the `new` keyword.

3. Avoid unnecessary sorting: The code sorts the array after reading the input integers. However, we only need to count the number of distinct integers, so sorting the array is unnecessary. We can optimize this step by removing the sorting operation.

4. Optimize the distinct count loop: The loop that counts the number of distinct integers can be optimized. Instead of decrementing `ans` for each non-duplicate element, we can keep track of the current element and compare it with the next element. If they are the same, we can skip to the next element without decrementing `ans`.

5. Use `std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false)`: By default, C++ standard streams are synchronized with the C standard I/O library for compatibility reasons. However, this synchronization can add overhead. By disabling it using `std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false)`, we can improve the I/O performance.

Here's the optimized code with the above improvements:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>

int main() {
  std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);

  int n;
  std::cin >> n;

  int* mas = new int[n];
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    std::cin >> mas[i];
  }

  int ans = n;
  for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; ++i) {
    if (mas[i] == mas[i + 1]) {
      --ans;
    }
  }

  std::cout << ans << std::endl;

  delete[] mas;

  return 0;
}
```

By applying these optimizations, we have reduced unnecessary operations, improved memory usage by using dynamic memory allocation, and eliminated redundant code. The overall performance and memory usage of the program should be significantly improved.
