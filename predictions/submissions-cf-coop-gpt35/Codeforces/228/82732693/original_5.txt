The given code reads 4 integers into an array `mas`, sorts the array, and then counts the number of distinct values in the array. The final count is stored in the variable `ans` and printed to the console. 

To optimize this code, we can make the following changes:

1. Replace the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header with specific headers needed for the program. This will reduce the compilation time and avoid unnecessary inclusion of unused headers.

2. Remove the unnecessary use of `using namespace std;` and instead use the `std::` prefix for standard library functions and types. This will prevent any potential naming conflicts and improve code clarity.

3. Change the array `mas` to a `std::array` or `std::vector` to improve memory allocation and eliminate any potential buffer overflows. Since the size of the array is known at compile time, using `std::array` is a better choice than `std::vector`.

4. Modify the sorting algorithm to use a more efficient algorithm, such as `std::sort` or `std::stable_sort`. This will improve the sorting time complexity from O(n^2) to O(n log n).

5. Optimize the counting loop by reducing the number of comparisons. Instead of comparing each element with the next element, we can keep track of the last distinct value encountered and increment the count only when a new distinct value is found.

6. Add compiler optimizations, such as `-O3` or `-Ofast`, to enable aggressive optimization by the compiler.

Here's the optimized code with the above changes:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <array>
#include <algorithm>

int main() {
  std::array<int, 4> mas;
  int ans = 3;

  for (int i = 0; i < 4; ++i) {
    std::cin >> mas[i];
  }

  std::sort(mas.begin(), mas.end());

  int last = mas[0];
  for (int i = 1; i < 4; ++i) {
    if (mas[i] != last) {
      --ans;
      last = mas[i];
    }
  }

  std::cout << ans;

  return 0;
}
```

These optimizations will reduce unnecessary memory allocation, improve sorting performance, and reduce the number of comparisons in the counting loop. The code complexity remains the same, but the performance is improved.
