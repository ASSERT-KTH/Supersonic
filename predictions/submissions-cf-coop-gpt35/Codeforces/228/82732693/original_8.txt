The provided code reads four integers from the input, stores them in an array, sorts the array, and then counts the number of distinct elements in the first three positions of the sorted array. The count is then outputted.

Here is an optimization strategy for this code:

1. Remove unnecessary include statements: The code includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header, which is not necessary and can slow down the compilation process. Instead, include only the necessary headers, such as `<iostream>` for input/output operations and `<algorithm>` for sorting.

2. Replace the fixed-size array with a dynamic data structure: The code uses a fixed-size array `mas[5]` to store the input. However, since the size of the input is not fixed, it is more efficient to use a dynamic data structure like `std::vector` to store the elements. This avoids potential buffer overflows and reduces memory usage.

3. Optimize the sorting algorithm: The code uses the `std::sort` algorithm to sort the array. While `std::sort` generally has good performance, it may not be the most efficient algorithm for small arrays. Consider using a simpler sorting algorithm like bubble sort or insertion sort for small arrays.

4. Optimize the counting algorithm: The code uses a simple loop to count the number of distinct elements in the sorted array. However, this can be optimized by using a set data structure to store the distinct elements. By inserting each element into the set, we can easily count the number of distinct elements at the end.

5. Add compiler optimizations: Use compiler-specific optimization flags or pragma directives to hint the compiler to optimize the code. For example, using the `-O2` flag with the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) will enable level 2 optimization, which can improve the performance of the code.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_set>

int main() {
  std::vector<int> mas(4);
  
  for (int i = 0; i < 4; ++i) {
    std::cin >> mas[i];
  }
  
  // Use a simpler sorting algorithm like bubble sort for small arrays
  for (int i = 0; i < 3; ++i) {
    for (int j = 0; j < 3 - i; ++j) {
      if (mas[j] > mas[j + 1]) {
        std::swap(mas[j], mas[j + 1]);
      }
    }
  }
  
  std::unordered_set<int> distinctElements;
  for (int i = 0; i < 3; ++i) {
    distinctElements.insert(mas[i]);
  }
  
  int ans = 3 - distinctElements.size();
  std::cout << ans;
  
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized code addresses the performance bottlenecks and inefficient memory usage in the original code. It replaces the fixed-size array with a `std::vector`, uses a simpler sorting algorithm for small arrays, and uses a `std::unordered_set` to count the distinct elements. Additionally, it removes unnecessary include statements and adds comments to explain the changes made.
