Code Analysis:
The given code reads four integers from the input, stores them in an array `mas`, sorts the array, and then checks for unique elements. The number of unique elements is then stored in the variable `ans`, which is finally printed as the output.

Potential Performance Bottlenecks:
1. Sorting the array: The `sort` function takes O(n log n) time complexity, where n is the number of elements in the array. This can be a potential performance bottleneck if the input size is large.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Efficient Data Structure: Instead of using an array to store the elements, we can use an unordered_set to directly store unique elements. This will eliminate the need for sorting and checking for uniqueness separately.
2. Unnecessary Computation: We can avoid the second loop by directly calculating the number of unique elements while reading input.
3. Compiler Optimization: We can use compiler optimization flags or pragmas to enable compiler optimizations, such as loop unrolling or inline expansion, to improve performance.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Replace the array `mas` with an unordered_set, `uniqueElements`, to directly store unique elements.
2. Remove the sorting step using `sort` function, as it is no longer needed.
3. While reading input, insert each element into the `uniqueElements` set. If the insertion is successful, increment the `ans` variable.

Optimized Code Block:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_set>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  unordered_set<int> uniqueElements;
  int ans = 0;

  for (int i = 0; i < 4; ++i) {
    int num;
    cin >> num;
    if (uniqueElements.insert(num).second) {
      ++ans;
    }
  }

  cout << ans;
  return 0;
}
```

In the optimized code, we have replaced the array `mas` with an unordered_set `uniqueElements`. We no longer need to sort the elements or check for uniqueness separately. Instead, we directly insert each input element into the `uniqueElements` set. If the insertion is successful (i.e., the element is unique), we increment the `ans` variable. Finally, we print the value of `ans` as the output.

The optimized code is more efficient because it eliminates the need for sorting and avoids redundant computations. The time complexity of the optimized code is O(1), as there are a fixed number of elements being inserted into the unordered_set. This is a significant improvement over the original code, which had a time complexity of O(n log n) due to the sorting step.

The trade-off of this optimization is that it requires additional memory to store the unordered_set. However, the memory usage is still reasonable for the given problem size, and the improved performance outweighs the memory overhead.
