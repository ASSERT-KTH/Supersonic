Code Analysis:
- The code defines several macros and includes the entire `bits/stdc++.h` header, which is generally discouraged due to its large size and potential for slower compilation times.
- The `rep` and `rep1` macros are used for loop iteration, but they can be replaced with standard `for` loops for better readability.
- The code uses `endl` for line breaks, which flushes the output stream each time it is called. This can be replaced with a simple `"\n"` for improved performance.
- The code includes unnecessary mathematical constants and functions that are not used.
- The `power` function is implemented to calculate modular exponentiation efficiently, but it can be simplified and optimized further.
- The `divisors` function calculates all divisors of a number, but it can be optimized to find divisors more efficiently.
- The code uses a map to store intermediate results, which incurs additional memory overhead.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Remove unnecessary macros and includes to reduce code size and improve compilation time.
2. Replace the `rep` and `rep1` macros with standard `for` loops for better readability.
3. Replace `endl` with `"\n"` for faster output.
4. Remove unnecessary mathematical constants and functions that are not used.
5. Optimize the `power` function to use the Binary Exponentiation algorithm for faster modular exponentiation.
6. Optimize the `divisors` function to find divisors more efficiently using a single loop.
7. Replace the `map` with a simple array to store intermediate results for better memory efficiency.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Remove unnecessary macros and includes:
   - Remove the `mod` macro since it is not used.
   - Replace the `bits/stdc++.h` include with specific includes for the required standard libraries.

2. Replace the `rep` and `rep1` macros:
   - Replace `rep(i, n)` with `for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)`.
   - Replace `rep1(i, a, b)` with `for (int i = a; i < b; i++)`.

3. Replace `endl` with `"\n"`:
   - Replace `endl` with `"\n"` for faster output. This avoids flushing the output stream unnecessarily.

4. Remove unnecessary mathematical constants and functions:
   - Remove the `PI`, `is_pot`, `degreesToRadians`, and `radiansToDegrees` macros since they are not used.

5. Optimize the `power` function:
   - Simplify the `power` function by removing the check for `x = 0` since it is not needed.
   - Use the Binary Exponentiation algorithm to calculate the modular exponentiation more efficiently.

6. Optimize the `divisors` function:
   - Use a single loop instead of iterating up to `sqrt(n)`.
   - When `i` is a divisor of `n`, add both `i` and `n/i` to the vector of divisors.

7. Replace the `map` with a simple array:
   - Use a simple array `mp` instead of a map to store intermediate results.
   - Access the array using the divisor as an index.

Optimized Code Block:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <cmath>

using namespace std;

const int mod = 1000000007;

int power(int x, int y, int p) {
    int res = 1;
    x = x % p;
    while (y > 0) {
        if (y & 1)
            res = (res * x) % p;
        y = y >> 1;
        x = (x * x) % p;
    }
    return res;
}

vector<int> divisors(int n) {
    vector<int> v;
    for (int i = 2; i * i <= n; i++) {
        if (n % i == 0) {
            v.push_back(i);
            if (n / i != i)
                v.push_back(n / i);
        }
    }
    return v;
}

void solve() {
    int x, y;
    cin >> x >> y;
    if (y % x != 0) {
        cout << 0 << "\n";
        return;
    }
    if (y / x == 1) {
        cout << 1 << "\n";
        return;
    }
    int sum = y / x;
    int ans = power(2, sum - 1, mod);
    ans = (ans - 1 + mod) % mod;
    vector<int> div = divisors(sum);
    sort(div.begin(), div.end());
    int mp[div.size()] = {0};
    for (int i = 0; i < div.size(); i++) {
        int cur = power(2, div[i] - 1, mod);
        vector<int> div1 = divisors(div[i]);
        for (int p : div1) {
            cur = (cur - mp[p] + mod) % mod;
        }
        mp[div[i]] = (cur - 1 + mod) % mod;
        ans = (ans - (cur - 1) + mod) % mod;
    }
    cout << ans << "\n";
}

int main() {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(NULL);

    solve();

    return 0;
}
```
