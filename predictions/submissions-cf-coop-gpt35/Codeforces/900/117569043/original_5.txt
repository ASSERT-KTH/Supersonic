The given code calculates the number of subsets of a set such that the sum of the elements in each subset is divisible by a given number. The code uses various mathematical properties and functions to calculate the answer.

Upon analyzing the code, we can identify a few potential areas for optimization:

1. Redundant calculations: The code calculates the same values multiple times, leading to unnecessary computations. For example, the `power` function is called multiple times with the same arguments. We can optimize this by storing the result of the power function in a variable and reusing it when needed.

2. Inefficient data structures: The code uses a vector and a map to store intermediate values, which can be inefficient in terms of memory usage and lookup time. We can consider using arrays instead of vectors and unordered_map instead of map for better performance.

3. Unnecessary sorting: The code sorts the `div` vector unnecessarily. Since the divisors of a number are calculated in ascending order, there is no need to sort them again. We can remove the sorting step to improve efficiency.

4. Loop optimization: The code uses a for loop to iterate over the `div` vector, but the size of the vector is calculated in each iteration. We can optimize this by storing the size in a variable and reusing it.

5. Compiler optimizations: We can use compiler optimizations to help improve the performance of the code. This can include enabling optimization flags (`-O2`, `-O3`) or using pragmas to provide hints to the compiler.

Now, let's proceed with the optimization steps one by one.

Step 1: Redundant calculations
In the `power` function, the `x` value is being calculated modulo `p` in each iteration. We can optimize this by calculating `x` modulo `p` at the beginning and reusing it in the loop. Additionally, we can store the result of `x % p` in a variable and update `x` with the new value in each iteration. This will avoid redundant calculations of `x % p` and improve performance.

Step 2: Inefficient data structures
The `div` vector can be replaced with an array, as the size of the vector is known in advance. We can also replace the `map` with an `unordered_map` for better performance in terms of lookup time.

Step 3: Unnecessary sorting
We can remove the sorting step for the `div` vector, as the divisors are already calculated in ascending order.

Step 4: Loop optimization
Instead of calling the `size` function in each iteration of the loop, we can store the size in a variable and reuse it. This will avoid unnecessary function calls and improve performance.

Step 5: Compiler optimizations
We can enable compiler optimizations by adding appropriate flags (`-O2`, `-O3`) during compilation. Additionally, we can use pragmas to provide hints to the compiler for specific optimizations.

Now, let's implement these optimization steps in the code.

This optimized code reduces redundant calculations, replaces inefficient data structures, removes unnecessary sorting, optimizes loops, and provides hints for compiler optimizations. The changes are minimal yet effective, preserving the functionality and output of the original code while improving performance and reducing memory usage.
