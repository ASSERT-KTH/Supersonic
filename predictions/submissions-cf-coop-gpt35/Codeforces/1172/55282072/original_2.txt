Code Analysis:
1. The code uses a custom struct `mod_int` to perform arithmetic operations on integers modulo `MOD`.
2. The code calculates factorials, inverse factorials, and inverse values using precomputation and memoization.
3. The code uses a map `save` to store previously computed values and avoid redundant computations.
4. The code uses nested loops to calculate the answer for each query in the main function.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Instead of using a map `save` to store previously computed values, we can use a 2D array to store the results. This will improve memory usage and access time.
2. The code uses the `mod_int` struct for arithmetic operations. We can replace the `mod_int` struct with simple integer operations and use the modulus operator `%` to perform modulo calculations. This will eliminate the need for custom struct and improve performance.
3. We can optimize the loops in the `solve` function by reducing redundant calculations and loop iterations.
4. We can use compiler optimizations, such as loop unrolling, to improve the performance of the nested loops in the main function.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Remove the `mod_int` struct and replace it with simple integer operations:
   - Remove the `mod_int` struct definition and all its member functions.
   - Replace all instances of `mod_int` with `int` in the code.
   - Replace `MOD` with its actual value `998244353` in the code.
   - Replace `mod_inv` function with a simple modulo inverse function using Fermat's Little Theorem: `int mod_inv(int a) { return pow(a, MOD - 2); }`
   - Replace `pow` function with a simple modular exponentiation function: `int pow(int a, int p) { return p == 0 ? 1 : (p % 2 == 0 ? pow((a * a) % MOD, p / 2) : (a * pow(a, p - 1)) % MOD); }`
2. Replace the `save` map with a 2D array to store previously computed values:
   - Replace `map<int, mod_int> save[2]` with `int save[2][1001]` to store previously computed values for like and dislike cases.
   - Replace `save[like].find(weight) != save[like].end()` with `save[like][weight] != 0` to check if the value is present in the array.
   - Replace `save[like][weight] = answer` with `save[like][weight] = (int)answer` to store the value in the array.
3. Optimize the loops in the `solve` function:
   - In the like case loop, we can precalculate the values of `starter` and `other` outside the loop to avoid redundant calculations.
   - In the dislike case loop, we can precalculate the values of `starter` and `other` outside the loop to avoid redundant calculations.
   - In both cases, we can replace the inner loop with a single calculation using the formula for binomial coefficient.
4. Add compiler optimizations to the nested loops in the main function:
   - Add `#pragma GCC optimize("unroll-loops")` before the main function to enable loop unrolling.
