Analysis:

1. The code reads an integer `n` from the input, creates an array `a` of size `n`, and a `multiset` named `st` to store the coins.
2. It then reads `n` integers and stores them in the array `a`.
3. The code iterates over each element in `a` and subtracts 25 from it. It then tries to use the available coins (75, 50, and 25) to make up the remaining amount. If it fails to do so, it sets the boolean variable `ok` to false and breaks out of the loop.
4. Finally, it prints the verdict based on the value of `ok`.

Potential optimizations:

1. Avoid using `bits/stdc++.h`: This header includes all the standard library headers, which can lead to longer compilation times and unnecessary code bloat. It is better to include only the necessary headers.

2. Use a constant size array instead of a variable size array: The array `a` is currently declared using the variable `n`. This is not standard C++. Instead, we can use a constant size array or allocate memory dynamically using `new`. Since the size is not known at compile-time, we can use a `std::vector` instead.

3. Avoid unnecessary multiset operations: The code uses a `multiset` to store the coins. However, it uses `count` and `find` operations to check if a coin is available and erase it. These operations have a time complexity of O(log n) in a `multiset`. We can use a `std::vector` instead, and sort it in descending order. This will allow us to check if a coin is available in O(1) time and erase it in O(n) time using `std::remove`.

4. Optimize the coin selection loop: The code currently uses a nested loop to select the coins. We can optimize this by using a single loop and selecting the coins in decreasing order. This will allow us to break out of the loop as soon as the remaining amount is zero.

5. Avoid unnecessary checks: The code checks if `ret` is non-zero before entering the coin selection loop. However, since the loop will not execute if `ret` is zero, this check is redundant.

Optimization steps:

1. Remove the unnecessary `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` and replace it with the necessary headers.
2. Replace the variable size array `int a[n]` with a `std::vector<int> a(n)`.
3. Replace the `multiset` with a `std::vector<int>` and sort it in descending order.
4. Optimize the coin selection loop by using a single loop and breaking out early.
5. Remove the unnecessary check for `ret` before entering the coin selection loop.

Optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

#define verdict (ok ? "YES" : "NO")

int main() {
  int n;
  std::cin >> n;
  std::vector<int> a(n);
  std::vector<int> coins = {75, 50, 25};
  for (auto &i : a)
    std::cin >> i;
  bool ok = true;
  
  // Sort the coins in descending order
  std::sort(coins.begin(), coins.end(), std::greater<int>());
  
  std::vector<int> st;
  for (int i : a) {
    int ret = i - 25;
    for (int coin : coins) {
      while (ret >= coin && !st.empty() && st.back() == coin) {
        ret -= coin;
        st.pop_back();
      }
    }
    if (ret) {
      ok = false;
      break;
    }
    st.push_back(i);
  }
  
  std::cout << verdict << '\n';
  return 0;
}
```

Trade-offs:
- The optimized code has a slightly increased code complexity due to the additional sorting step and the use of a `std::vector` instead of a `multiset`. However, this trade-off is acceptable as it significantly improves the performance of the code by reducing the time complexity of the coin selection loop.
- The optimized code may use slightly more memory due to the use of a `std::vector` instead of a `multiset`. However, the difference in memory usage is negligible compared to the performance gain achieved.
