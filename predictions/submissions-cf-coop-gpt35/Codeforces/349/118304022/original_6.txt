Code Analysis:
- The code reads an integer `n` as input.
- It then reads `n` integers into an array `a`.
- It uses a `multiset` named `st` to store the values in `a` in descending order.
- It checks if it is possible to give change for each value in `a` using coins of denominations 75, 50, and 25.
- If it is possible to give change for all values, it prints "YES", otherwise it prints "NO".

Optimization Strategy:
1. Inefficient data structure: The use of a `multiset` to store the values in `a` is inefficient because it allows duplicate values. However, we only need to keep track of the count of each value, not the actual values themselves. Using a `map<int, int>` instead of a `multiset` will allow us to store the count of each value more efficiently.
2. Redundant computations: The code currently checks if `ret` is non-zero before entering the loop to give change using coins. However, this check is unnecessary because the loop will terminate immediately if `ret` is zero. Removing this check will eliminate the redundant computation.
3. Compiler optimizations: Adding compiler optimizations such as `-O2` or `-O3` can enable the compiler to perform additional optimizations on the code, such as loop unrolling or function inlining.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Replace the `multiset<int, greater<>> st` declaration with `map<int, int> st` to store the count of each value in `a`.
   - This change improves memory usage by only storing the count of each value instead of the actual values themselves.
   - It also improves performance by reducing the number of memory allocations and deallocations required by the `multiset`.
2. Remove the check for `ret` being non-zero before entering the loop to give change using coins.
   - This change eliminates the redundant computation of checking `ret` before entering the loop.
   - The loop will terminate immediately if `ret` is zero, so the check is unnecessary.
3. Add compiler optimizations such as `-O2` or `-O3` to enable additional optimizations by the compiler.
   - Compiler optimizations can include loop unrolling, function inlining, and other code transformations that can improve performance.

Optimized Code:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
#define verdict (ok ? "YES" : "NO")
int main() {
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  int a[n];
  map<int, int> st;
  const int coins[] = {75, 50, 25};
  for (auto &i : a)
    cin >> i;
  bool ok = true;
  for (int i : a) {
    int ret = i - 25;
    for (int coin : coins) {
      while (ret && st[coin] && ret >= coin)
        ret -= coin, st[coin]--;
    }
    if (ret) {
      ok = false;
      break;
    }
    st[i]++;
  }
  cout << verdict << '\n';
  return 0;
}
```

The changes made to the code are minimal yet effective. The optimized code preserves the functionality and output of the original code while improving performance and minimizing memory usage.

Note: The use of `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` is discouraged as it includes a large number of standard library headers, which can slow down compilation time. It is better to include only the necessary headers for the code.
