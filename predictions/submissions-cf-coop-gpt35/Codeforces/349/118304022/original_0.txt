Code Analysis:
- The code reads an integer `n` from the user and creates an array `a` of size `n`.
- It then reads `n` integers from the user and stores them in the array `a`.
- The code uses a `multiset` named `st` to keep track of the available coins.
- The code initializes a boolean variable `ok` to `true`.
- For each element `i` in the array `a`:
  - It calculates the difference between `i` and 25.
  - It checks if the difference is non-zero.
  - If it is non-zero, it iterates over the coins array and repeatedly subtracts the largest available coin from the difference until it becomes zero or negative.
  - If the difference is still non-zero after iterating over all the coins, it sets `ok` to `false` and breaks out of the loop.
  - Finally, it inserts the element `i` into the `multiset` `st`.
- It prints the value of `verdict` (either "YES" or "NO") and a newline character.

Potential optimizations:
1. Using `vector` instead of `multiset`: The `multiset` data structure is not necessary for this problem. Since the order of the coins does not matter, we can use a `vector` to store the available coins. This will reduce the memory usage and the overhead of maintaining the sorted order of the coins.
2. Using a loop instead of a range-based for loop: The use of a range-based for loop in the second `for` loop can be replaced with a regular `for` loop, as we are not modifying the values of `a`.
3. Simplifying the coin subtraction: Instead of repeatedly subtracting the largest available coin from the difference, we can use integer division and modulus to calculate the number of coins of each type required. This will eliminate the need for the inner loop and improve the efficiency of the subtraction process.
4. Using a boolean flag instead of the `verdict` macro: Instead of using a macro to define the `verdict` string based on the value of `ok`, we can use a boolean flag and print the corresponding string directly. This will simplify the code and improve readability.

Optimization strategy:
1. Replace the `multiset` with a `vector`.
2. Replace the range-based for loop with a regular for loop.
3. Simplify the coin subtraction using integer division and modulus.
4. Replace the `verdict` macro with a boolean flag and print the corresponding string directly.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Replace the `multiset` with a `vector`:
   - `multiset<int, greater<>>` is used to store the available coins in descending order.
   - We can replace it with a `vector<int>` to simplify the code and reduce memory usage.
   - The elements can be inserted into the `vector` using the `push_back` function.
   - The `erase` function can be replaced with the `erase`-`remove` idiom to remove an element from the `vector`.
   - The `find` function is not needed as we are always removing the largest available coin.
   - The `count` function is not needed as we can use the `size` function to check if the `vector` is empty or not.
2. Replace the range-based for loop with a regular for loop:
   - Since we are not modifying the values of `a`, we can use a regular for loop instead of a range-based for loop.
   - This will avoid the overhead of creating an additional variable for each iteration.
   - The loop can be rewritten as `for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)`.
3. Simplify the coin subtraction using integer division and modulus:
   - Instead of repeatedly subtracting the largest available coin from the difference, we can calculate the number of coins of each type required using integer division and modulus.
   - We can calculate the number of 75 coins as `ret / 75` and update the value of `ret` as `ret % 75`.
   - Similarly, we can calculate the number of 50 and 25 coins.
   - This eliminates the need for the inner loop and improves the efficiency of the subtraction process.
4. Replace the `verdict` macro with a boolean flag:
   - Instead of using the `verdict` macro to define the `verdict` string based on the value of `ok`, we can use a boolean flag directly.
   - We can initialize the boolean flag `ok` to `true` and set it to `false` if the difference is non-zero after subtracting the coins.

Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  vector<int> a(n);
  vector<int> coins = {75, 50, 25};
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
    cin >> a[i];
  bool ok = true;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    int ret = a[i] - 25;
    if (ret) {
      int num75 = ret / 75;
      ret %= 75;
      int num50 = ret / 50;
      ret %= 50;
      int num25 = ret / 25;
      if (num75 > coins[0] || num50 > coins[1] || num25 > coins[2]) {
        ok = false;
        break;
      }
      coins[0] -= num75;
      coins[1] -= num50;
      coins[2] -= num25;
    }
    coins.push_back(a[i]);
  }
  cout << (ok ? "YES" : "NO") << '\n';
  return 0;
}
```

Note: I have removed the `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` directive as it is not recommended to use in production code.
