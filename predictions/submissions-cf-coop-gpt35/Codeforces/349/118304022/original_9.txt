Code Analysis:
1. The code reads an integer `n` as input.
2. It creates an array `a` of size `n` to store the input values.
3. It initializes a multiset `st` to store the coins in descending order.
4. It defines an array `coins` with values {75, 50, 25}.
5. It reads `n` integers and stores them in array `a`.
6. It iterates over each element `i` in array `a`.
7. For each element `i`, it calculates the difference `ret` between `i` and 25.
8. It checks if `ret` is non-zero.
9. If `ret` is non-zero, it iterates over the coins array and tries to subtract the coins from `ret` until `ret` becomes zero or all coins are used.
10. If `ret` is still non-zero after using all the coins, it sets `ok` to false and breaks the loop.
11. Finally, it inserts the element `i` into the multiset `st`.
12. It prints the verdict based on the value of `ok`.

Potential Optimizations:
1. The use of `multiset` for storing coins can be improved as it allows duplicate entries. However, in this case, we only need to store the count of each coin type. Using a `multiset` can lead to unnecessary memory usage and slower operations.
2. The loop that subtracts the coins from `ret` can be optimized by using a single loop instead of nested loops.
3. The loop that iterates over the array `a` can be optimized by using a constant reference instead of a value.
4. The `multiset` operations can be optimized by using `unordered_multiset` instead.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Replace the `multiset` with an `unordered_multiset` to store the count of each coin type.
2. Modify the loop that subtracts the coins from `ret` to use a single loop instead of nested loops.
3. Use a constant reference in the loop that iterates over the array `a`.
4. Add compiler optimizations to hint the compiler for further optimizations.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Replace the line `multiset<int, greater<>> st;` with `unordered_multiset<int> st;`. This change will improve the memory usage and speed of `multiset` operations.
2. Modify the loop that subtracts the coins from `ret` to use a single loop instead of nested loops. Replace the nested loop with a single loop as follows:
   ```
   for (int coin : coins) {
     while (ret && st.count(coin) && ret >= coin)
       ret -= coin, st.erase(st.find(coin));
   }
   ```
   with
   ```
   for (int coin : coins) {
     int count = st.count(coin);
     if (count) {
       int subtract = min(count, ret / coin);
       ret -= subtract * coin;
       st.erase(coin);
     }
   }
   ```
   This change reduces the number of iterations and improves the efficiency of the loop.
3. Modify the loop that iterates over the array `a` to use a constant reference instead of a value. Replace the line `for (int i : a)` with `for (const int& i : a)`. This change avoids unnecessary copying of the array elements and improves performance.
4. Add compiler optimizations to hint the compiler for further optimizations. Add the following pragma directive at the beginning of the code:
   ```
   #pragma GCC optimize("O3")
   ```
   This pragma directive instructs the GCC compiler to optimize the code for performance.

Optimized Code:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
#define verdict (ok ? "YES" : "NO")

int main() {
  #pragma GCC optimize("O3")
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  int a[n];
  unordered_multiset<int> st;
  const int coins[] = {75, 50, 25};
  for (auto &i : a)
    cin >> i;
  bool ok = true;
  for (const int& i : a) {
    int ret = i - 25;
    if (ret) {
      for (int coin : coins) {
        int count = st.count(coin);
        if (count) {
          int subtract = min(count, ret / coin);
          ret -= subtract * coin;
          st.erase(coin);
        }
      }
      if (ret) {
        ok = false;
        break;
      }
    }
    st.insert(i);
  }
  cout << verdict << '\n';
  return 0;
}
```

The optimized code reduces unnecessary memory usage, improves the efficiency of the coin subtraction loop, and avoids unnecessary copying of array elements. The addition of the pragma directive hints the compiler for further optimizations.
