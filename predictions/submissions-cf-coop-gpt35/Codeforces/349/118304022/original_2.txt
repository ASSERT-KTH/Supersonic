Optimization Strategy:

1. Replace the `multiset` with a `vector` and sort it in descending order. This will eliminate the need for the `multiset`'s `count()` and `erase()` operations, which have a time complexity of O(log n). With the `vector`, we can use a binary search to find and erase elements, which has a time complexity of O(log n) as well.

2. Remove the unnecessary check for `ret` in the inner loop. If `ret` becomes zero, we can break out of the loop since we have already paid the exact change.

3. Use `reserve()` to preallocate memory for the `vector` to avoid unnecessary reallocations.

4. Use `const` references for the `coins` array to avoid unnecessary copying.

5. Use `std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false)` to disable synchronization between C and C++ standard streams, which can improve input/output performance.

6. Use `std::cin.tie(NULL)` to untie `std::cin` from `std::cout`, which can also improve input/output performance.

7. Use `endl` instead of `'\n'` for the output stream to ensure that the output is flushed immediately.

Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. Replace the `multiset` with a `vector` and sort it in descending order. This optimization will improve the efficiency of the `count()` and `erase()` operations, which have a time complexity of O(log n) in the `multiset`. With the `vector`, we can use a binary search to find and erase elements, which also has a time complexity of O(log n).

2. Remove the unnecessary check for `ret` in the inner loop. The inner loop checks if `ret` is non-zero and if there are any coins of the current denomination in the `multiset`. However, if `ret` becomes zero, we have already paid the exact change and can break out of the loop.

3. Use `reserve()` to preallocate memory for the `vector` to avoid unnecessary reallocations. By reserving the maximum possible size for the `vector` before populating it, we can avoid reallocations and improve performance.

4. Use `const` references for the `coins` array to avoid unnecessary copying. By using `const` references instead of directly copying the `coins` array, we can avoid unnecessary memory copying and improve performance.

5. Use `std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false)` to disable synchronization between C and C++ standard streams. By disabling synchronization, we can improve input/output performance, especially when dealing with large input or output.

6. Use `std::cin.tie(NULL)` to untie `std::cin` from `std::cout`. By untieing the input and output streams, we can improve input/output performance, especially when dealing with large input or output.

7. Use `endl` instead of `'\n'` for the output stream. Using `endl` instead of `'\n'` ensures that the output is immediately flushed, which can be beneficial in some cases.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

#define verdict (ok ? "YES" : "NO")

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);

  int n;
  cin >> n;
  vector<int> a(n);
  vector<int> st;
  const vector<int> coins = {75, 50, 25};
  for (auto &i : a)
    cin >> i;

  sort(a.rbegin(), a.rend());
  st.reserve(n);

  bool ok = true;
  for (int i : a) {
    int ret = i - 25;
    if (ret) {
      for (int coin : coins) {
        while (ret >= coin && !st.empty() && ret >= st.back()) {
          ret -= coin;
          st.pop_back();
        }
      }
      if (ret) {
        ok = false;
        break;
      }
    }
    st.push_back(i);
  }

  cout << verdict << endl;
  return 0;
}
