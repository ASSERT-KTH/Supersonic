Code Analysis:
- The code calculates the sum of combinations of numbers in an array `a` with some constraints.
- It uses two precomputed arrays `pows` and `c` to calculate the combinations and powers efficiently.
- The code has a time complexity of O(nlogn) due to the sorting operation.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Remove unnecessary headers: The `bits/stdc++.h` header includes a large number of standard library headers, which may not be needed in this code. We can include only the necessary headers, such as `iostream` and `algorithm`, to reduce the compilation time and memory usage.
2. Avoid unnecessary macros: The `fastIO` macro is not used in the code and can be removed.
3. Avoid using `using namespace std;`: This can lead to naming conflicts and is generally not recommended. Instead, use the `std::` prefix for standard library functions and types.
4. Use more efficient data types: The code uses `ll` (long long) for variables and arrays. However, it is not clear why a larger data type is required. If a smaller data type, such as `int`, can be used without causing overflow or precision issues, it will reduce memory usage.
5. Use a more efficient sorting algorithm: The code uses the `sort` function from the `<algorithm>` header, which has a time complexity of O(nlogn). If the input array `a` is already sorted or nearly sorted, a linear-time sorting algorithm like counting sort or radix sort can be used to improve performance.
6. Optimize the combination calculation: The code uses the `c` array to calculate combinations. However, this can be optimized by using the formula `C(n, r) = C(n-1, r) + C(n-1, r-1)`. This avoids the need for a separate 2D array and reduces the number of modulo operations.
7. Remove redundant modulo operations: The code performs modulo operations at multiple places. If the final result is guaranteed to be within the range of the modulo value, these modulo operations can be deferred until the end to reduce the number of operations.
8. Optimize the power calculation: The code uses the `power` function to calculate powers. This can be optimized by using repeated squaring or binary exponentiation, which reduces the number of multiplications and modulo operations.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Remove unnecessary headers:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>
```
2. Remove unnecessary macros:
```cpp
#define MOD 1000000007
#define M 1001
```
3. Avoid using `using namespace std;` and use `std::` prefix:
```cpp
using std::cout;
using std::cin;
using std::sort;
```
4. Use more efficient data types:
```cpp
int a[M];
int pows[M];
int c[M][M];
```
5. Use a more efficient sorting algorithm:
```cpp
std::sort(a + 1, a + m + 1);
```
6. Optimize the combination calculation:
```cpp
for (int i = 1; i <= 1000; i++) {
  c[i][0] = 1;
  for (int j = 1; j <= i; j++) {
    c[i][j] = (c[i - 1][j] + c[i - 1][j - 1]);
  }
}
```
7. Remove redundant modulo operations:
```cpp
sum = (sum * c[d][a[i] - a[i - 1] - 1]);
```
8. Optimize the power calculation:
```cpp
for (int i = 2; i <= m; i++) {
  sum = (sum * pows[a[i] - a[i - 1] - 1]);
}
```

Optimized Code:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>

#define M 1001

int a[M];
int pows[M];
int c[M][M];

int power(int x, int y, int mod) {
  int res = 1;
  x = x % mod;
  if (x == 0) {
    return 0;
  }
  while (y > 0) {
    if (y % 2 == 1) {
      res = (res * x) % mod;
    }
    y /= 2;
    x = (x * x) % mod;
  }
  return res;
}

int main() {
  std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  std::cin.tie(NULL);

  pows[0] = 1;
  pows[1] = 1;
  for (int i = 2; i <= 1000; i++) {
    pows[i] = (pows[i - 1] * 2);
  }

  for (int i = 1; i <= 1000; i++) {
    c[i][0] = 1;
    for (int j = 1; j <= i; j++) {
      c[i][j] = (c[i - 1][j] + c[i - 1][j - 1]);
    }
  }

  int m, n;
  std::cin >> n >> m;
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    std::cin >> a[i];
  }
  std::sort(a + 1, a + m + 1);

  int sum = 1;
  int d = n - m;
  for (int i = 1; i <= m; i++) {
    sum = (sum * c[d][a[i] - a[i - 1] - 1]);
    d -= a[i] - a[i - 1] - 1;
  }
  for (int i = 2; i <= m; i++) {
    sum = (sum * pows[a[i] - a[i - 1] - 1]);
  }

  std::cout << sum << "\n";

  return 0;
}
