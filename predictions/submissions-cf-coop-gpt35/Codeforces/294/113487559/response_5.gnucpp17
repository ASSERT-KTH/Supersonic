This code calculates the sum of a series of combinations and powers based on the input values. It uses the modular arithmetic property to keep the values within the range of `MOD`.

To optimize this code, we can focus on the following areas:

1. Reducing the number of modulo operations: The code uses the modulo operation (`%`) extensively, which can be computationally expensive. We can minimize the number of modulo operations by performing modulo only once at the end of calculations or by using properties of modular arithmetic.

2. Avoiding unnecessary calculations: The code performs unnecessary calculations for the power of 2 (`pows`). We can optimize this by using the property that `pow(x, y) % MOD` is equivalent to `(x % MOD)^y % MOD` and store the intermediate results in an array.

3. Avoiding redundant memory usage: The code uses a 2D array `c[M][M]` to store combination values. Since the maximum value of `M` is 1001, this can lead to a significant amount of memory usage. We can optimize this by using a 1D array instead.

4. Using efficient data structures: The code uses a simple array to store values. We can optimize this by using a more efficient data structure like `vector` or `deque`.

5. Using compiler optimizations: We can use compiler optimizations like loop unrolling, function inlining, and pragma directives to help the compiler optimize the code during compilation.
