Code Analysis:
- The code calculates the maximum radius of a circle centered at the origin that can contain a set of given points in a plane.
- It uses binary search to find the maximum radius.
- The function `isOk` checks if a given radius is valid by checking if the circle with that radius can contain all the points.
- The code uses a lot of unnecessary includes and defines, which can be removed to improve compilation time.
- The code uses `double` for coordinates, but converts them to `long double` for calculations. This can be avoided to improve performance.
- The code uses unnecessary looping for finding the absolute value of `y[i]` and checking if `y[i] * y[n-1] < 0`. This can be simplified.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Remove unnecessary includes and defines.
2. Avoid unnecessary type conversions.
3. Simplify the logic for checking if `y[i] * y[n-1] < 0`.
4. Optimize the `isOk` function to reduce the number of calculations and eliminate unnecessary comparisons.
5. Use more meaningful variable names for better code readability.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Remove unnecessary includes and defines. These are not used in the code and can be safely removed.

2. Avoid unnecessary type conversions:
- Replace `double` with `long double` for `x` and `y` arrays to avoid type conversions in calculations.

3. Simplify the logic for checking if `y[i] * y[n-1] < 0`:
- Instead of checking the product of `y[i]` and `y[n-1]`, we can directly check if `y[i]` and `y[n-1]` have opposite signs. This can be done by multiplying them and checking if the result is less than zero.

4. Optimize the `isOk` function:
- Instead of calculating `k * 2` multiple times, calculate it once and store it in a variable.
- Instead of calculating `k - y[i]` multiple times, calculate it once and store it in a variable.
- Instead of calculating `k * k - (k - y[i]) * (k - y[i])` multiple times, calculate it once and store it in a variable.
- Instead of calling `sqrt` function, use `std::sqrt` function directly.
- Instead of using `max` and `min` functions, use simple comparisons to update `l` and `r` variables.
- Instead of returning `false` immediately when `y[i] > k * 2`, update `l` and `r` variables and continue the loop. This avoids unnecessary early exits and improves performance.

5. Use more meaningful variable names:
- Replace `l` with `left` and `r` with `right` to improve code readability.
