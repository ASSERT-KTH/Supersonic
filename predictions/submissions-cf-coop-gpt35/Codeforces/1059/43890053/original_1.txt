Optimization Strategy:
1. Remove unnecessary includes: We can remove the unnecessary includes such as `<bitset>`, `<deque>`, `<list>`, `<map>`, `<queue>`, `<set>`, `<stack>`, `<string>`, and `<vector>`. These headers are not used in the code and including unnecessary headers can increase compilation time.
2. Remove the `line` and `mem` macros: The `line` macro is not used in the code and can be removed. The `mem` macro can be replaced with `memset` directly in the code to improve readability.
3. Replace `typedef long long ll` with `using ll = long long`: The `typedef` syntax is error-prone and can lead to subtle bugs. Using the `using` syntax provides a clearer and safer way to define type aliases.
4. Replace constant values with variables: The constant values `inf` and `mod` are not used in the code and can be removed. The constant value `maxn` can be replaced with `n` since it represents the same value.
5. Replace `double` with `vector<double>` for `x` and `y`: Instead of using fixed-size arrays for `x` and `y`, we can use `vector<double>` to allow for dynamic resizing and cleaner code.
6. Avoid unnecessary absolute value computation: Instead of computing the absolute value of `y[i]` in the loop, we can check if `y[i]` and `y[n - 1]` have different signs. If they do, we can immediately return -1 as the solution is not possible.
7. Use a constant for the number of iterations in the binary search loop: Instead of hardcoding the number of iterations as 100, we can use a constant or variable to control the number of iterations. This allows for easier tuning and experimentation.
8. Replace `printf` and `scanf` with `cout` and `cin`: The `printf` and `scanf` functions are slower and less type-safe compared to `cout` and `cin`. By replacing them, we can improve performance and reduce the risk of format string vulnerabilities.

By applying these optimizations, we can improve the performance and readability of the code without changing its functionality or output.
