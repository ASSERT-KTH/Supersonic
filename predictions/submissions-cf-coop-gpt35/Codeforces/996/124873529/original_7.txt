The given code appears to be a C++ program that solves a specific problem. However, there are several areas of the code that can be optimized for improved performance. Let's analyze the code and propose optimization strategies for each section.

1. Redundant/Unnecessary Code:
   - The `#define` statements for loop macros (`forloop`) and other macros (`ll`, `ld`, `pb`, etc.) are not used in the code. These can be removed to simplify the code.

2. Recursive Function:
   - The `fun` function is implemented recursively and is called multiple times in a loop. Recursive calls can be costly in terms of memory and performance. We can optimize this function by using a dynamic programming approach, such as memoization, to avoid redundant function calls.

3. Floating Point Arithmetic:
   - The line `arr[i] = ceil(double(arr[i]) / n);` performs floating-point arithmetic unnecessarily. Since `arr[i]` is an integer and `n` is also an integer, we can use integer division (`/`) directly to achieve the same result.

4. Loop Optimization:
   - The loop that finds the minimum value in the `arr` vector can be optimized by using a range-based for loop instead of a traditional for loop. This eliminates the need for an index variable and simplifies the code.

Now, let's proceed with implementing these optimization strategies in the code.
