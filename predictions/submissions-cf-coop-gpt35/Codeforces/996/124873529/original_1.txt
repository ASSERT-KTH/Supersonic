The given code is a C++ program that calculates the minimum index of an array `arr` based on certain calculations. The program uses various macros and functions for input/output, looping, and mathematical operations.

Here is the optimization strategy for the given code:

1. Remove unnecessary headers: The `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` header includes all standard library headers, which can increase compilation time and memory usage. We should include only the necessary headers instead.

2. Remove unused macros: There are several macros defined in the code that are not used anywhere. We should remove these macros to improve code readability.

3. Remove unnecessary function objects: The lambdas `power` and `mod` are defined but not used in the code. We should remove these function objects to simplify the code.

4. Optimize the `fun` function: The `fun` function is a recursive function that can be optimized using memoization. We should use a memoization technique, such as memoizing the results of previously calculated function calls, to avoid redundant recursive calls.

5. Optimize the `solve` function: The `solve` function can be optimized by removing unnecessary calculations and loop iterations.

6. Use more appropriate data types: The `arr` vector is declared as `vll` (vector of `long long`) even though the array elements are integers. We can use a more appropriate data type, such as `vector<int>`, to save memory.

7. Simplify the main function: The main function can be simplified by removing unnecessary macros and function calls.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <cmath>

using namespace std;

int fun(int m, int n, vector<vector<int>>& memo) {
    if (n == 1) {
        return 1;
    }
    if (memo[m][n] != -1) {
        return memo[m][n];
    }
    if (n > m) {
        return memo[m][n] = 0;
    }
    return memo[m][n] = fun(m - 1, n, memo) + fun(m / 2, n - 1, memo);
}

void solve() {
    int n;
    cin >> n;
    vector<int> arr(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        cin >> arr[i];
        arr[i] -= i;
        if (arr[i] <= 0) {
            cout << i + 1 << endl;
            return;
        }
        arr[i] = ceil(double(arr[i]) / n);
    }
    vector<vector<int>> memo(n + 1, vector<int>(n + 1, -1));
    int mn = INT_MAX, mni;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (mn > arr[i]) {
            mn = arr[i];
            mni = i;
        }
    }
    cout << mni + 1 << endl;
}

int main() {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(NULL);
    cout.tie(NULL);
    solve();
    return 0;
}
```

This optimized code eliminates unnecessary headers, macros, and function objects. It also improves the performance of the `fun` function by using memoization. Additionally, it simplifies the main function and uses a more appropriate data type for the `arr` vector.
