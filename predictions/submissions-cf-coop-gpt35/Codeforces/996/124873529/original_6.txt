The given code appears to be a C++ program that solves a specific problem. However, there are several areas where the code can be optimized for efficiency. Let's analyze the code and identify potential areas for optimization.

1. The use of unnecessary header files: The code includes the header file `<bits/stdc++.h>`, which includes all standard C++ libraries. This can lead to increased compile times and unnecessary memory usage. It is better to include only the necessary header files.

2. Macro usage: The code uses several macros for code readability, but they may impact performance. Macros are replaced by the preprocessor, which can cause code bloat and inefficient code generation. It is better to use inline functions or constants instead of macros.

3. Redundant or unnecessary computations: The code includes some unnecessary computations, such as computing the power of a number and calculating the modulus of a number. These computations can be optimized or removed to improve performance.

4. Inefficient data structures: The code uses vectors to store arrays and other data structures. While vectors provide dynamic resizing, they may lead to unnecessary memory allocations and deallocations. It is better to use fixed-size arrays or other more efficient data structures if possible.

5. Recursive function: The function `fun` is implemented recursively, which may lead to unnecessary function calls and stack usage. It can be optimized by using an iterative approach or tail recursion.

6. Loop optimization: The code includes a loop to find the minimum element in an array. This can be optimized by using a more efficient algorithm or by using library functions that provide better performance.

Based on this analysis, let's formulate an optimization strategy and propose specific optimizations for the code.
