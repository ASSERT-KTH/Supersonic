Code Analysis:
1. The code includes unnecessary header files (`<bits/stdc++.h>`) that can be replaced with specific header files that are actually required.
2. The code has several macros defined, which can make the code harder to read and understand. It is better to avoid using macros and instead use explicit function calls.
3. The function `fun(m, n)` is a recursive function that can be optimized by memoization to avoid redundant computations.
4. The code uses a vector (`vll arr(n)`) to store the input values, but it only uses the values once and does not require random access. Using a simple array instead of a vector can improve memory usage and performance.
5. The code calculates the ceiling of a division operation (`ceil(double(arr[i]) / n)`) unnecessarily. Since `arr[i]` is an integer, the result will also be an integer.
6. The code uses the `INT_MAX` constant from the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header. It is better to include the specific header that defines this constant (`<limits.h>`).

Optimization Strategy:
1. Replace `<bits/stdc++.h>` with specific header files that are actually required, such as `<iostream>`, `<vector>`, and `<algorithm>`.
2. Remove unnecessary macros and replace them with explicit function calls.
3. Optimize the `fun(m, n)` function using memoization.
4. Replace the vector with a simple array to improve memory usage and performance.
5. Remove the unnecessary `ceil` function call.
6. Include the `<limits.h>` header for the `INT_MAX` constant.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Replace `<bits/stdc++.h>` with specific header files that are actually required, such as `<iostream>`, `<vector>`, and `<algorithm>`. This ensures that only the necessary header files are included and reduces the compilation time.
2. Remove unnecessary macros and replace them with explicit function calls. Macros can make the code harder to read and understand, and using explicit function calls improves code clarity and maintainability.
3. Optimize the `fun(m, n)` function using memoization. Memoization stores the result of each function call in a lookup table, allowing subsequent calls with the same parameters to retrieve the result directly from the table instead of recomputing it. This reduces redundant computations and improves performance.
4. Replace the vector with a simple array to improve memory usage and performance. Since the values are only accessed sequentially and do not require random access, using a simple array is more efficient.
5. Remove the unnecessary `ceil` function call. Since `arr[i]` is an integer, the result of the division will also be an integer. There is no need to calculate the ceiling of the division.
6. Include the `<limits.h>` header for the `INT_MAX` constant. This ensures that the code is portable and does not rely on implementation-specific headers.

Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <limits.h>
using namespace std;

void solve();
int fun(int m, int n, vector<vector<int>>& memo);

int main() {
  solve();
  return 0;
}

void solve() {
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  int arr[n];
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> arr[i];
    arr[i] -= i;
    if (arr[i] <= 0) {
      cout << i + 1 << endl;
      return;
    }
    arr[i] = arr[i] / n;
  }
  int mn = INT_MAX, mni;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    if (mn > arr[i]) {
      mn = arr[i];
      mni = i;
    }
  }
  cout << mni + 1 << endl;
}

int fun(int m, int n, vector<vector<int>>& memo) {
  if (n == 1)
    return 1;
  if (n > m)
    return 0;
  if (memo[m][n] != -1)
    return memo[m][n];
  int result = fun(m - 1, n, memo) + fun(m / 2, n - 1, memo);
  memo[m][n] = result;
  return result;
}
```

In the optimized code, the unnecessary macros have been removed and replaced with explicit function calls. The `fun` function has been optimized using memoization, which is implemented using a 2D vector `memo`. The vector `arr` has been replaced with a simple array, and the `ceil` function call has been removed. The code also includes the `<limits.h>` header for the `INT_MAX` constant.
