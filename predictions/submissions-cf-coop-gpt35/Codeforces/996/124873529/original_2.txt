The provided code is a C++ program that finds the minimum index of an array based on some calculations. However, the code contains several areas that can be optimized for efficiency. 

1. Unnecessary or Redundant Code:
   - The `bits/stdc++.h` header includes the entire C++ standard library, which is unnecessary and can increase compilation time. It is better to include only the necessary headers.
   - The `pb` macro is defined but not used anywhere in the code. It can be removed.
   - The `parmar2002` macro includes `cin.tie(NULL)` and `cout.tie(NULL)`, which are used to untie the input and output streams for faster I/O with C++. However, these macros are not used in the code and can be removed.
   - The `sclock` and `eclock` macros use `clock()` to measure the execution time of the code. However, these macros are not used in the code and can be removed.
   - The `finout` macro is used to redirect standard input and output to files. It is not necessary for the optimization process and can be removed.
   - The `retf` macro is defined but not used anywhere in the code. It can be removed.
   - The `vint`, `vll`, `vld`, `vbool`, `vpii`, and `vpll` typedefs are defined but not used anywhere in the code. They can be removed.

2. Recursive Function:
   - The `fun` function is implemented recursively, which can be inefficient for large inputs due to repeated function calls. It can be optimized using dynamic programming to avoid redundant calculations.

3. Loop Optimization:
   - The loop that calculates the minimum value and its index can be optimized by using a single loop instead of two loops. This will reduce the time complexity from O(n) to O(n/2).

4. Function Objects:
   - The `power` and `mod` function objects are defined but not used anywhere in the code. They can be removed.

Based on these observations, the following optimizations can be applied to the code:

1. Remove unnecessary headers, macros, and typedefs.
2. Optimize the `fun` function using dynamic programming to avoid redundant calculations.
3. Optimize the loop that calculates the minimum value and its index.
4. Remove the unused function objects.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <cmath>
#include <climits>

using namespace std;

int fun(int m, int n) {
  vector<vector<int>> dp(m + 1, vector<int>(n + 1, 0));
  
  for (int i = 1; i <= m; i++) {
    for (int j = 1; j <= n; j++) {
      if (j == 1)
        dp[i][j] = 1;
      else if (i < j)
        dp[i][j] = 0;
      else
        dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j] + dp[i / 2][j - 1];
    }
  }
  
  return dp[m][n];
}

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  cout.tie(NULL);
  
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  
  vector<long long> arr(n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> arr[i];
    arr[i] -= i;
    if (arr[i] <= 0) {
      cout << i + 1 << endl;
      return 0;
    }
    arr[i] = ceil(static_cast<double>(arr[i]) / n);
  }
  
  int mn = INT_MAX, mni;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    if (mn > arr[i]) {
      mn = arr[i];
      mni = i;
    }
  }
  
  cout << mni + 1 << endl;
  
  return 0;
}
```

By applying these optimizations, the code should run faster and use memory more efficiently.
