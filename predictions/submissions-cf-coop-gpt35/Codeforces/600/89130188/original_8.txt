Analysis:

1. The code uses a map to keep track of the frequency of each color in a subtree. This map is passed as a reference to the `dfs2` function, which recursively updates the map for each subtree. However, this approach is inefficient because maps have a logarithmic time complexity for both insertion and access operations. As a result, the time complexity of the code is high.

2. The code uses a depth-first search (DFS) to traverse the tree and compute the answer for each node. However, the current implementation of the DFS is not optimized and can be further improved.

3. The code uses a global array `ans` to store the answer for each node. This array is filled during the DFS traversal. However, the use of a global array is not necessary and can be avoided.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Replace the map with an array to store the frequency of each color in a subtree. Since the colors are represented by integers, we can use an array of size `NR` to store the frequency of each color. This will improve the time complexity from logarithmic to constant time for both insertion and access operations.

2. Instead of passing the array as a reference to the `dfs2` function and updating it recursively, we can use a separate array to store the frequency of each color for each subtree. This will eliminate the need for recursive updates and improve the efficiency of the code.

3. Modify the DFS traversal to compute the answer for each node in a bottom-up manner. This can be done by passing the result array as a reference to the DFS function and updating it as the DFS traversal progresses.

4. Remove unnecessary global variables and replace them with local variables. This will improve the modularity and readability of the code.

5. Use `reserve` function to allocate memory for the vectors `v` to avoid unnecessary reallocation during the input phase.

Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. Replace the map with an array:
   - Create a new array `freq` of size `NR` to store the frequency of each color.
   - Replace all occurrences of `mapp` with `freq` in the `dfs2` function.
   - Replace `mapp[c[nod]]` with `freq[c[nod]]` in the `dfs2` function.
   - Replace `mapp[it2.first]` with `freq[it2.first]` in the `dfs2` function.
   - Remove the declaration of `map<lll, lll> temp;` and replace it with `lll temp[NR] = {0};` in the `main` function.

2. Modify the DFS traversal:
   - Update the `dfs2` function signature to accept the result array as a reference: `void dfs2(lll nod, lll prt, lll ans[], lll &l_max)`.
   - Replace all occurrences of `ans` with `ans[nod]` in the `dfs2` function.
   - Remove the declaration of the global array `lll ans[NR];`.
   - Pass the result array `ans` as a reference to the `dfs2` function in the `main` function.

3. Remove unnecessary global variables:
   - Remove the declaration of the global arrays `lll sz[NR]` and `lll big[NR]`.
   - Replace `sz[nod]` with a local variable `lll sz = 1` in the `dfs1` function.
   - Replace `big[nod]` with a local variable `lll big = 0` in the `dfs1` function.

4. Use `reserve` function to allocate memory for the vectors:
   - Add `v.reserve(NR);` after the declaration of `v` in the `main` function.

    lll temp[NR] = {0};
    dfs2(it, nod, temp, l);

        sum = i;
      }
    }
  }
  l_max = max_;
  ans[nod] = sum;
}

signed main() {

This optimized code improves the efficiency of the original code by replacing the map with an array, modifying the DFS traversal, removing unnecessary global variables, and using the `reserve` function to allocate memory for the vectors. These optimizations reduce the time complexity and improve the overall performance of the code.
