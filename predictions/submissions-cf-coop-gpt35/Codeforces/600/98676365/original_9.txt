Code Analysis:
1. The code uses a segment tree data structure to solve a tree-related problem.
2. The `Seg` struct represents a node in the segment tree, with fields for left child (`lson`), right child (`rson`), value (`v`), number of occurrences (`num`), and sum of values (`sum`).
3. The `t` array represents the segment tree.
4. The `modify` function is used to update the segment tree by incrementing the number of occurrences and updating the sum and value of a node.
5. The `merge` function is used to merge two nodes in the segment tree by recursively merging their children and updating the sum and value of the merged node.
6. The `dfs` function performs a depth-first search on the tree, merging child nodes into the parent node and updating the segment tree with the current node's value.
7. The `solve` function reads input, initializes the segment tree, performs the depth-first search, and prints the answers.
8. The main function calls the solve function.

Potential optimizations:
1. Avoid using `bits/stdc++.h` header, which includes unnecessary headers and can increase compilation time. Instead, include only the necessary headers.
2. Replace the `typedef long long ll` with `using ll = long long` to improve code readability.
3. Remove the unnecessary `rt` array and the associated merge function. The merge operation can be performed directly in the `dfs` function.
4. Use an iterative approach instead of recursion in the `dfs` function to avoid function call overhead.
5. Replace the `vector<int>` with a fixed-size array for the adjacency list, since the maximum number of nodes is known in advance.
6. Use an array to store the input values instead of the `cor` vector, since the maximum number of nodes is known in advance.
7. Avoid using the `read` function for input reading and instead use `cin` or `scanf` for faster input reading.
8. Use `cout` or `printf` for output printing instead of `printf("%lld%c", ans[i], " \n"[i == n])` for faster output.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Remove unnecessary headers and replace `typedef` with `using` for improved code readability.
2. Replace the `vector<int>` with a fixed-size array for the adjacency list.
3. Use an array to store the input values instead of the `cor` vector.
4. Replace the recursive `dfs` function with an iterative approach to avoid function call overhead.
5. Use `cin` or `scanf` for input reading and `cout` or `printf` for output printing for faster input/output operations.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Remove unnecessary headers and replace `typedef` with `using`:
   - The code currently includes the `bits/stdc++.h` header, which is not recommended. Instead, include only the necessary headers, such as `<iostream>` and `<cstdio>`.
   - Replace the `typedef long long ll` with `using ll = long long` for improved code readability.

2. Replace the `vector<int>` with a fixed-size array for the adjacency list:
   - The code currently uses a `vector<int>` for the adjacency list `G`. Since the maximum number of nodes is known in advance, it is more efficient to use a fixed-size array for the adjacency list.
   - Replace `vector<int> G[maxn]` with `int G[maxn][maxn]` to store the adjacency list.

3. Use an array to store the input values instead of the `cor` vector:
   - The code currently uses a `vector<int>` to store the input values. Since the maximum number of nodes is known in advance, it is more efficient to use an array to store the values.
   - Replace `vector<int> cor[maxn]` with `int cor[maxn]` to store the input values.

4. Replace the recursive `dfs` function with an iterative approach:
   - The `dfs` function currently uses recursion to perform a depth-first search on the tree. Recursion can have function call overhead, especially for large trees.
   - Replace the recursive `dfs` function with an iterative approach using a stack to simulate the depth-first search.
   - Instead of merging child nodes into the parent node at each level, store the parent node index in the stack and merge the child nodes when visiting the parent node.
   - This approach eliminates the need for the `merge` function and the `rt` array.

5. Use `cin` or `scanf` for input reading and `cout` or `printf` for output printing:
   - The code currently uses a custom `read` function for input reading and `printf` for output printing. Using `cin` or `scanf` for input reading and `cout` or `printf` for output printing can provide faster input/output operations.
