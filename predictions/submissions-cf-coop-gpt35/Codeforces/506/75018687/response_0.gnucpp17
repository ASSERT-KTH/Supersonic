The provided code seems to be solving a problem related to disjoint sets. Here are some potential optimizations that can be made:

1. Unnecessary includes: The code includes several unnecessary header files, such as `<algorithm>`, `<chrono>`, `<cstring>`, `<ctime>`, etc. These should be removed to reduce compilation time and unnecessary dependencies.

2. Unnecessary using directives: The code contains a `using namespace std;` directive, which brings all names from the `std` namespace into the global namespace. This is generally considered bad practice as it can lead to namespace collisions. It's better to explicitly specify the namespace for each name used.

3. Redundant map `r`: The code maintains a map `r` to keep track of the rank of each element in each set. However, the rank is not used anywhere in the code. This map can be removed to reduce memory usage.

4. Inefficient find operation: The `get` function uses recursion to find the representative of a set. This can be inefficient for large sets as it may result in stack overflow. It's better to use an iterative approach instead.

5. Inefficient union operation: The `unite` function performs multiple lookups in the map `p` for each union operation. This can be optimized by using the `unordered_map::find` function instead of `count` and `[]` operations.

6. Redundant map `mp`: The code maintains a map `mp` to store the results of previous queries. However, this map is not used effectively. It only stores the result for the pair `(a, b)` and not for the pair `(b, a)`. This can be optimized by using a bidirectional map or by storing the results in both directions.

7. Unnecessary exit call: The program calls `exit(0)` at the end. This is not necessary as the program will terminate naturally after reaching the end of the `main` function.
