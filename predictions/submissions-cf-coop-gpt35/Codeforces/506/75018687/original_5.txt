Code Analysis:

1. The code includes several unnecessary header files that are not used in the program, such as `<algorithm>`, `<chrono>`, `<ctime>`, `<iomanip>`, etc. These should be removed to reduce compilation time and unnecessary memory usage.

2. The code defines several macros, such as `try`, `ld`, `pii`, `pb`, `left`, `ignore`, `right`, etc. These macros can be confusing and make the code less readable. It is recommended to remove these macros and use proper variable and function names instead.

3. The code uses an unordered map `p` to keep track of parent nodes, an unordered map `r` to store ranks, and an unordered map `mp` to store precomputed results. However, using unordered maps for this purpose may not be the most efficient choice. It is worth considering alternative data structures that can provide better performance.

4. The code uses a disjoint set union-find algorithm to connect nodes based on their common parent. However, the implementation of the union-find algorithm can be optimized to reduce unnecessary lookups and assignments.

5. The code uses nested loops to iterate over the maps `p[a]` and `p[b]` to check for common keys. This nested loop can be a potential performance bottleneck, especially if the maps are large. There might be a more efficient way to achieve the same result.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Remove unnecessary header files: Remove the unnecessary header files `<algorithm>`, `<chrono>`, `<ctime>`, `<iomanip>`, etc., as they are not used in the program.

2. Remove macros: Remove the macros `try`, `ld`, `pii`, `pb`, `left`, `ignore`, `right`, etc., and replace them with proper variable and function names.

3. Use more efficient data structures: Replace the unordered maps `p`, `r`, and `mp` with more efficient data structures that can provide better performance for the given problem.

4. Optimize the union-find algorithm: Improve the implementation of the union-find algorithm to reduce unnecessary lookups and assignments. This can be achieved by using path compression and union by rank techniques.

5. Optimize the loop for checking common keys: Find a more efficient way to check for common keys between `p[a]` and `p[b]` without using a nested loop.

Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. Remove unnecessary header files:
   - Remove the unnecessary header files `<algorithm>`, `<chrono>`, `<ctime>`, `<iomanip>`, etc.

2. Remove macros:
   - Remove the macros `try`, `ld`, `pii`, `pb`, `left`, `ignore`, `right`, etc., and replace them with proper variable and function names.

3. Use more efficient data structures:
   - Replace the unordered maps `p`, `r`, and `mp` with more efficient data structures that can provide better performance. One possible alternative is to use arrays instead of maps, as the keys are integers.

4. Optimize the union-find algorithm:
   - Improve the implementation of the union-find algorithm by using path compression and union by rank techniques. This can reduce unnecessary lookups and assignments, leading to improved performance.

5. Optimize the loop for checking common keys:
   - Find a more efficient way to check for common keys between `p[a]` and `p[b]` without using a nested loop. This can potentially improve the performance of the program.

Optimized Code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#define MAX_N 100001

using namespace std;

int p[MAX_N][lg], r[MAX_N][lg], mp[MAX_N][lg];

int get(int a, int c) {
  if (p[a][c] == a)
    return a;
  return p[a][c] = get(p[a][c], c);
}

void unite(int a, int b, int c) {
  if (p[a][c] == 0)
    p[a][c] = a;
  if (p[b][c] == 0)
    p[b][c] = b;
  a = get(a, c);
  b = get(b, c);
  if (a == b)
    return;
  if (r[a][c] == r[b][c])
    r[a][c]++;
  if (r[a][c] > r[b][c])
    p[b][c] = a;
  else
    p[a][c] = b;
}

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0);
  cin.tie(0);
  cout.tie(0);

  int n, m;
  cin >> n >> m;

  for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
    int a, b, c;
    cin >> a >> b >> c;
    unite(a, b, c);
  }

  int q;
  cin >> q;

  while (q--) {
    int a, b;
    cin >> a >> b;
    if (a > b)
      swap(a, b);
    if (mp[a][b] != 0) {
      cout << mp[a][b] << endl;
      continue;
    }
    int res = 0;
    for (int c = 1; c <= sq; c++) {
      if (p[a][c] != 0 && p[b][c] != 0)
        res += (get(a, c) == get(b, c));
    }
    mp[a][b] = res;
    cout << res << '\n';
  }

  return 0;
}
```

The optimized code makes the following changes:

1. Removed unnecessary header files.
2. Removed macros and replaced them with proper variable and function names.
3. Replaced unordered maps with arrays to store parent nodes, ranks, and precomputed results.
4. Optimized the union-find algorithm using path compression and union by rank techniques.
5. Replaced the nested loop with a single loop to check for common keys between `p[a]` and `p[b]`.

These optimizations should improve the performance of the code by reducing unnecessary memory usage, improving data structure choices, and optimizing critical sections of the code.
