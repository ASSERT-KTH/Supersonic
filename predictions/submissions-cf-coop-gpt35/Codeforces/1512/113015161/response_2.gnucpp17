Upon analyzing the given code, the following potential areas for optimization can be identified:

1. Redundant and unnecessary header inclusion: The `<bits/stdc++.h>` header includes a large number of standard library headers, which can increase compilation time. It is better to include only the necessary headers.

2. Excessive use of typedefs: The code includes a large number of typedefs, which can make the code more difficult to read and understand. It is recommended to use the actual data types instead of typedefs.

3. Unnecessary using statements: The code includes several using statements for different data types, but these are not used consistently throughout the code. It is better to remove the unused using statements.

4. Inefficient data structures: The code uses data structures such as vectors, sets, and maps, which can have high memory overhead and slow down performance. It is worth considering alternative data structures that are more efficient for the given problem.

5. Inefficient loops: The code includes nested loops that iterate over a large range of values. These loops can be optimized by using more efficient loop constructs or by reducing the number of iterations.

6. Inefficient algorithm: The `sum_of_divisors` function calculates the sum of divisors for each number in the range [1, 1e7]. This can be a time-consuming operation. There might be more efficient algorithms for calculating the sum of divisors.

7. Unnecessary function calls: The code includes several function calls that might not be necessary or can be optimized. For example, the `pow_mod` function can be optimized by using the binary exponentiation algorithm.

8. Unused code: The code includes several functions that are not used or called. It is better to remove the unused code to improve readability and maintainability.

Based on these observations, the following optimization steps can be proposed:

1. Remove unnecessary header inclusion: Replace the `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` with the necessary standard library headers that are actually used in the code.

2. Remove unnecessary typedefs: Remove the typedefs that are not used consistently throughout the code. Use the actual data types instead.

3. Remove unused using statements: Remove the using statements for data types that are not used consistently throughout the code.

4. Optimize data structures: Replace the data structures with more efficient alternatives where applicable. For example, replace vectors with arrays if the size is fixed and known at compile time. Replace sets and maps with unordered sets and unordered maps if order is not important.

5. Optimize loops: Analyze the loops and identify opportunities for optimization. For example, use a more efficient loop construct such as a range-based for loop where possible. Also, consider reducing the number of iterations in the loops if possible.

6. Optimize the `sum_of_divisors` function: Analyze the algorithm used for calculating the sum of divisors and consider alternative algorithms that are more efficient. For example, consider using a prime factorization-based algorithm to calculate the sum of divisors.

7. Optimize function calls: Analyze the function calls and consider optimizing them where possible. For example, optimize the `pow_mod` function by using the binary exponentiation algorithm.

8. Remove unused code: Remove the unused functions and code snippets to improve readability and maintainability.
