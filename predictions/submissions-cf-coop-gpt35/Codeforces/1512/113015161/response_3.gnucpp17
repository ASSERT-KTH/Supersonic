The given code is a C++ program that calculates the sum of divisors for numbers up to 10^7. It also includes various utility functions for prime number generation, prime factorization, and graph traversal.

Upon analyzing the code, I have identified several areas that can be optimized for better performance:

1. Redundant or unnecessary includes: The code includes the entire `bits/stdc++.h` header, which is not recommended for production code as it includes a large number of unnecessary headers. We should only include the necessary headers for the specific functionality used in the code.

2. Unnecessary type definitions: The code defines multiple type aliases for built-in types such as `bool`, `int`, `long`, etc. These aliases are not used in the code and can be removed.

3. Use of macros instead of inline functions: The code uses macros for common operations such as finding the minimum or maximum of multiple values. Instead of macros, we can define inline functions to achieve the same functionality. Inline functions are more type-safe and easier to debug.

4. Inefficient data structures: The code uses arrays for storing the sum of divisors (`a[]`) and a map for mapping the sum to the original number (`mp[]`). Both of these data structures have a fixed size of 10^7, which is not memory efficient. We can use dynamically allocated arrays or vectors to optimize memory usage.

5. Inefficient loop structure: The code uses nested loops to calculate the sum of divisors. This results in redundant computations and can be optimized to reduce the number of iterations.

6. Lack of compiler optimizations: The code does not include any compiler optimizations or pragma directives that can hint the compiler to optimize certain parts of the code. Enabling compiler optimizations can significantly improve the performance of the code.

Based on these observations, I propose the following optimization strategy:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: Remove the `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` line and include only the necessary headers for the specific functionality used in the code.

2. Remove unnecessary type definitions: Remove the type aliases that are not used in the code.

3. Replace macros with inline functions: Replace the macros for finding the minimum or maximum of multiple values with inline functions.

4. Use efficient data structures: Replace the fixed-size arrays `a[]` and `mp[]` with dynamically allocated arrays or vectors.

5. Optimize the loop structure: Optimize the loop structure to reduce redundant computations and improve efficiency.

6. Enable compiler optimizations: Add compiler optimizations or pragma directives to hint the compiler to optimize certain parts of the code.
