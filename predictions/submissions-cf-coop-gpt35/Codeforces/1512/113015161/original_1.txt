Code Analysis:
- The code includes many unnecessary typedefs and using statements that are not used anywhere in the code. These can be removed to reduce clutter.
- The code includes many unnecessary macros that are not used anywhere in the code. These can be removed to improve code readability.
- The code uses a mix of C++ and C-style code, making it less consistent and harder to read.
- The code uses global variables for the array `a` and map `mp`. Global variables should be minimized as they can lead to bugs and make the code harder to understand and maintain.
- The code uses a nested loop in the `sum_of_divisors` function to calculate the sum of divisors for each number. This can be optimized to reduce the number of iterations.
- The code uses a linear search to find the maximum value of `a[i]` in the `sum_of_divisors` function. This can be optimized to use a max heap or by keeping track of the maximum value during the loop.
- The code uses an if statement to check if `mp[c]` is non-zero before printing the result. This can be optimized to use a ternary operator to simplify the code.
- The code includes many unnecessary functions that are not used anywhere in the code. These can be removed to reduce clutter.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Remove unnecessary typedefs and using statements.
2. Remove unnecessary macros.
3. Convert C-style code to C++ code where possible.
4. Minimize the use of global variables.
5. Optimize the `sum_of_divisors` function to reduce the number of iterations and use a max heap or keep track of the maximum value during the loop.
6. Optimize the if statement in the `case_i` function to use a ternary operator.
7. Remove unnecessary functions.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Remove unnecessary typedefs and using statements.
   - The typedefs `boo`, `li`, `il`, `ul`, `ll`, `ull`, and `dd` are not used anywhere in the code. They can be removed.
   - The `str` typedef can be replaced with `std::string` to make it clear that it is a C++ string.
   - The `vli`, `vll`, `sli`, `sll`, `pli`, `pll`, `vpi`, `vpl`, `mpl`, `qll`, and `stl` typedefs are not used anywhere in the code. They can be removed.
   - The `std` namespace can be used specifically where needed instead of using `using namespace std` to avoid namespace pollution.
   
2. Remove unnecessary macros.
   - The `Test`, `input`, `lp`, `rlp`, `llmx`, `sz`, `min3`, `max3`, `min4`, `max4`, `max5`, `all`, `ci`, `co`, `fix`, `mem`, `lb`, `ub`, `MP`, `pb`, `F`, `S`, `nl`, `nll`, `sp`, `sl`, `cy`, `cn`, `case`, `go`, `Good_Bye`, `gcd`, `lcm`, `Faster`, `Input_txt` macros are not used anywhere in the code. They can be removed.

3. Convert C-style code to C++ code where possible.
   - Replace `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` with the necessary include statements for the specific libraries used in the code (e.g., `#include <iostream>`).
   - Replace C-style arrays with C++ vectors where appropriate.
   - Replace C-style loops with range-based loops or standard library algorithms where appropriate.

4. Minimize the use of global variables.
   - Move the `a` array and `mp` map inside the `sum_of_divisors` function to limit their scope and reduce the risk of bugs.

5. Optimize the `sum_of_divisors` function to reduce the number of iterations and use a max heap or keep track of the maximum value during the loop.
   - The current implementation of the `sum_of_divisors` function has a time complexity of O(N^2), where N is 1e7. This can be reduced to O(N log N) by using a max heap or keeping track of the maximum value during the loop.
   - Instead of iterating from 1 to 1e7 for each number i, we can iterate from i to 1e7 with a step size of i. This way, we only need to iterate through the divisors of each number once.
   - During the loop, we can calculate the sum of divisors for each number by adding the current divisor i to the sum of divisors for its multiples j (j = i, i+i, i+i+i, ...). This can be done using a max heap or by keeping track of the maximum value during the loop.
   - After the loop, we can iterate from 1 to 1e7 again and check if the sum of divisors for each number is within the range 1 to 1e7. If it is, we can update the map `mp` accordingly.

6. Optimize the if statement in the `case_i` function to use a ternary operator.
   - Instead of using an if statement to check if `mp[c]` is non-zero before printing the result, we can use a ternary operator to simplify the code.

7. Remove unnecessary functions.
   - Remove the `_pow`, `pow_mod`, `mod_inverse`, `factorial`, `is_prime`, `sieve_prime_generator`, `prime_factorization`, `total_divisors`, `dfs`, and `bfs` functions as they are not used anywhere in the code.

Optimized Code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <map>
#include <queue>

void sum_of_divisors() {
  std::vector<int> a(1e7 + 1, 0);
  std::map<int, int> mp;

  for (int i = 1; i <= 1e7; i++) {
    for (int j = i; j <= 1e7; j += i) {
      a[j] += i;
    }
  }

  int max_val = 0;
  for (int i = 1; i <= 1e7; i++) {
    if (a[i] <= 1e7) {
      mp[a[i]] = i;
      max_val = std::max(max_val, a[i]);
    }
  }
}

void case_i() {
  int c;
  std::cin >> c;

  std::map<int, int> mp;
  if (mp[c]) {
    std::cout << mp[c] << '\n';
  } else {
    std::cout << -1 << '\n';
  }
}

int main() {
  sum_of_divisors();

  int _;
  std::cin >> _;
  while (_--) {
    case_i();
  }

  return 0;
}
```

Note: The optimized code assumes that the necessary libraries are included at the beginning of the code.
