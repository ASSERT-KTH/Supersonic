Upon analyzing the given code, several potential areas for optimization can be identified:

1. Redundant/Unused Code: The code includes several typedefs and using statements that are not used anywhere in the program. These can be removed to improve code readability.

2. Inefficient Data Structures: The code uses several data structures such as vectors, sets, and maps that may not be the most efficient choice for the given task. Consider using more efficient alternatives such as arrays or unordered_maps.

3. Unnecessary Computations: The code performs unnecessary computations in the sum_of_divisors() function. The inner loop can be optimized to iterate only up to sqrt(j) instead of j, as all factors of j will be found before reaching the square root of j.

4. Compiler Optimizations: The code does not include any compiler optimizations or pragma directives. Adding appropriate compiler optimizations can help the compiler generate more efficient machine code.
