The given code is written in C++ and contains a number of macros, typedefs, and functions. However, most of these are not being used in the code and can be safely removed to improve code readability and reduce unnecessary complexity.

Here is the optimization strategy for the given code:

1. Remove Unused Macros and Typedefs: The code contains many macros and typedefs that are not being used. These can be removed to improve code readability and reduce unnecessary complexity.

2. Optimize the `sum_of_divisors` Function:
    - The `sum_of_divisors` function calculates the sum of divisors for each number from 1 to 1e7. However, it can be optimized by using a more efficient algorithm.
    - Currently, the function uses a nested loop to iterate over all numbers and their multiples to calculate the sum of divisors. This results in a time complexity of O(n^2).
    - We can optimize this function by using a more efficient algorithm with a time complexity of O(nlogn).
    - The optimized algorithm first calculates the smallest prime factor for each number from 1 to 1e7 using the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm.
    - Then, it uses the smallest prime factor to calculate the sum of divisors for each number. This can be done by using the formula: `sum = (p^(a+1) - 1) / (p - 1)`, where `p` is the prime factor and `a` is its exponent.
    - By using this optimized algorithm, we can significantly reduce the running time of the `sum_of_divisors` function.

3. Remove Unnecessary Code:
    - The code contains several unused functions such as `_pow`, `pow_mod`, `mod_inverse`, `factorial`, `is_prime`, `sieve_prime_generator`, `prime_factorization`, `total_divisors`, `dfs`, and `bfs`. These functions can be safely removed to simplify the code and improve readability.

4. Improve Variable Naming:
    - The code uses variable names such as `a`, `c`, `dx`, `dy`, `mp`, etc., which are not descriptive and can make the code harder to understand. It is recommended to use more meaningful variable names that reflect their purpose in the code.

Here is the optimized code after applying the above optimizations:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

void sum_of_divisors(std::vector<int>& a) {
    int n = a.size() - 1;
    std::vector<int> spf(n + 1, 0);

    for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
        if (spf[i] == 0) {
            for (int j = i; j <= n; j += i) {
                if (spf[j] == 0) {
                    spf[j] = i;
                }
            }
        }
    }

    for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
        int p = spf[i];
        int k = 0;
        int x = i;
        while (x % p == 0) {
            x /= p;
            k++;
        }
        a[i] = (p == i) ? 1 + p : (a[x] / (p - 1)) * (p * k + 1);
    }
}

int main() {
    const int MAXN = 1e7 + 1;
    std::vector<int> a(MAXN);
    sum_of_divisors(a);

    int t;
    std::cin >> t;
    while (t--) {
        int c;
        std::cin >> c;
        if (c <= MAXN && a[c] != 0) {
            std::cout << a[c] << '\n';
        } else {
            std::cout << -1 << '\n';
        }
    }

    return 0;
}
```

This optimized code removes the unnecessary complexity and improves the running time efficiency by using a more efficient algorithm for calculating the sum of divisors. Additionally, it simplifies the code by removing unused macros, typedefs, and functions.
