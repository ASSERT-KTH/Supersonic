Code Analysis:
1. The code initializes two arrays, `v1` and `mp1`, with size `N`. However, it also creates a `vector` called `mp1` with the same size `N`. This results in redundant memory allocation and can be optimized.
2. The first nested loop calculates the sum of all divisors of `j` and stores it in `v1[j]`. However, this can be optimized by using a more efficient algorithm to calculate the sum of divisors.
3. The second loop checks if `v1[i]` is less than `N` and if `mp1[v1[i]]` is zero, and then assigns `i` to `mp1[v1[i]]`. However, this can be optimized by eliminating the need for the second loop and the `mp1` array altogether.
4. The code reads an integer `t` and then enters a loop that reads `c` and checks if `mp1[c]` is non-zero. However, this can be optimized by removing the need for the loop and directly checking if `v1[c]` is less than `N`.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Remove the redundant `vector<long long> mp1(N, 0)` declaration at the beginning.
2. Optimize the calculation of the sum of divisors by using a more efficient algorithm that runs in O(sqrt(N)) time complexity.
3. Eliminate the second loop and the `mp1` array by directly checking if `v1[c]` is less than `N`.
4. Use compiler optimizations to improve the performance of the code.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Remove the redundant `vector<long long> mp1(N, 0)` declaration at the beginning. The array `mp1` is already declared as a global array `long long mp1[N]`.
2. Optimize the calculation of the sum of divisors by using the following algorithm:
   - For each number `i` from 1 to sqrt(N), calculate the sum of divisors of `i` and add it to all multiples of `i` less than or equal to N.
   - This algorithm reduces the time complexity from O(N^2) to O(N*sqrt(N)), which is more efficient.
3. Remove the second loop and modify the code to directly check if `v1[c]` is less than `N` to determine if `c` has a corresponding value in `v1`. If it does, output `c`. Otherwise, output -1.
4. Use compiler optimizations such as loop unrolling, vectorization, or any other relevant optimizations to further improve the performance of the code.

Optimized Code:
```
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <cmath>
using namespace std;

const long long N = 10000001;
long long v1[N];

int main() {
  for (int i = 1; i < sqrt(N); i++) {
    for (int j = i; j < N; j += i) {
      v1[j] += i;
      if (j + i < N) {
        v1[j + i] += j;
      }
    }
  }
  
  int t;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    int c;
    cin >> c;
    if (c < N && v1[c] < N)
      cout << c;
    else
      cout << -1;
    cout << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
