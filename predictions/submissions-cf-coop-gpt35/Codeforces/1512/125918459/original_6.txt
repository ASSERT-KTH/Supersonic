Analysis:
1. The code initializes two arrays, `v1` and `mp1`, with a size of `N`. However, `mp1` is also declared as a vector with the same size, which is redundant.
2. The code uses nested loops to calculate the sum of divisors for each number from 1 to `N`. This results in a time complexity of O(N^2).
3. The code then checks if the sum of divisors is less than `N` and if the corresponding index in `mp1` is 0. If true, it assigns the index of `v1` to `mp1`.
4. Finally, the code takes input `t` and iterates `t` times to read a number `c` and check if `mp1[c]` is non-zero.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Remove the redundant declaration of `mp1` as an array and vector.
2. Optimize the calculation of the sum of divisors by using a more efficient algorithm.
3. Use compiler optimizations to improve performance.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Remove the redundant declaration of `mp1` as an array. We can use the vector `mp1` instead.
2. Optimize the calculation of the sum of divisors by using a more efficient algorithm. Instead of iterating over all numbers from 1 to `N` for each number, we can use a modified version of the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm.
   - Create a vector `sumOfDivisors` of size `N` and initialize all elements to 1.
   - For each number `i` from 2 to `N`, iterate over all multiples of `i` and add `i` to their sum of divisors.
   - This algorithm has a time complexity of O(N log log N), which is much faster than the previous O(N^2).
3. Use compiler optimizations to improve performance.
   - Use optimization flags while compiling the code (e.g., `-O3` for maximum optimization).
   - Use pragma directives, if supported by the compiler, to hint the compiler to optimize certain parts of the code.

Optimized Code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

const long long N = 10000001;

int main() {
  vector<long long> sumOfDivisors(N, 1);

  // Calculate sum of divisors using modified Sieve of Eratosthenes
  for (int i = 2; i < N; i++) {
    for (int j = i; j < N; j += i) {
      sumOfDivisors[j] += i;
    }
  }

  // Create mp1 vector and initialize with -1
  vector<long long> mp1(N, -1);

  // Assign indices to mp1 for valid sum of divisors
  for (int i = 1; i < N; i++) {
    if (sumOfDivisors[i] < N && mp1[sumOfDivisors[i]] == -1) {
      mp1[sumOfDivisors[i]] = i;
    }
  }

  int t;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    int c;
    cin >> c;
    cout << mp1[c] << endl;
  }
}
```

The optimized code eliminates the redundant declaration of `mp1` as an array and vector. It also improves the calculation of the sum of divisors by using a more efficient algorithm. Additionally, it uses a vector to store the values of `mp1` and initializes it with -1 to represent invalid values. Compiler optimizations, such as optimization flags and pragma directives, can be used during compilation to further improve performance.
