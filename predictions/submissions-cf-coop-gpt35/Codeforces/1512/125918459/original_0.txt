The given code calculates the sum of divisors for each number from 1 to N, and then finds the smallest number whose sum of divisors equals a given input number. 

Upon analyzing the code, the following potential areas for optimization can be identified:

1. Redundant Data Structures: The code declares two arrays, `v1` and `mp1`, to store the sum of divisors and the smallest number respectively. However, the `mp1` array is declared twice, once as a static array and then as a vector. This leads to redundant memory usage.

2. Unnecessary Computations: The code performs unnecessary computations for numbers whose sum of divisors is greater than or equal to N. These computations can be skipped to improve performance.

3. Nested Loops: The code uses nested loops to calculate the sum of divisors for each number. This can be a potential bottleneck for large values of N.

4. Linear Search: After calculating the sum of divisors, the code performs a linear search to find the smallest number with a given sum of divisors. This search can be improved by using a more efficient data structure.

Based on these observations, the following optimization strategy can be formulated:

1. Remove the redundant `mp1` array declaration and use the vector `mp1` instead.

2. Skip unnecessary computations by limiting the range of the inner loop to `min(N, v1[i])`.

3. Optimize the calculation of the sum of divisors by using the prime factorization approach. This approach will reduce the complexity from O(N^2) to O(N log N).

4. Use a hashmap instead of a linear search to find the smallest number with a given sum of divisors. This will reduce the search complexity from O(N) to O(1).

Now, let's proceed with the optimization steps.
