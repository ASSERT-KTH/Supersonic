This code appears to be solving a dynamic programming problem. However, there are several areas where performance can be improved:

1. Unnecessary includes: The code includes a large number of unnecessary header files. We can remove these to improve compilation time and reduce clutter.

2. Redundant definitions: The code defines `int` and `ll` as the same type. This is redundant and can be removed.

3. Inefficient data structure: The code uses a 2D vector (`vvi`) to store the dynamic programming table. This is not memory efficient and can be replaced with a 1D vector.

4. Inefficient loop structure: The nested loops in the `solve` function can be optimized. Currently, the loops iterate over the entire range of `c` and `k`, even though the values of `c` and `k` are limited by the problem constraints.

5. Unnecessary variables: The variable `tmp` is unnecessary and can be removed.

6. Redundant code: The code contains unreachable code after the `solve` function. This can be removed.

7. Unnecessary precision: The code uses `fixed` and `setprecision` to set the precision of the output. This precision is not required and can be removed.
