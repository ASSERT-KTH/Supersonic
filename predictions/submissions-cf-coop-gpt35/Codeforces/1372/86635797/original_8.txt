The given code is a C++ program that takes an input value `T` which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it takes an input value `n` followed by `n` integers. The program then checks whether the given sequence is sorted or not, and based on that, it prints the minimum number of operations required to sort the sequence.

Upon analyzing the code, we can identify several areas where optimization can be done:

1. Unnecessary preprocessor macros: The code uses several preprocessor macros like `fr`, `frr`, `rfrr`, `watch`, `prv`, `debv`, `min3`, `max3`, `fastio`, etc. These macros make the code less readable and don't provide much value in terms of performance optimization.

2. Unnecessary data structures: The code uses a `vector<bool>` called `rng` to track whether each element in the input sequence needs to be changed or not. This `vector<bool>` is not memory efficient and can be replaced with a more memory-efficient data structure.

3. Redundant calculations: The code calculates the number of changes required to sort the sequence by iterating over the `rng` vector twice. This can be optimized to calculate the number of changes in a single loop.

4. Redundant conditions: The code has multiple conditional statements to check different cases. These conditions can be simplified and combined to reduce the number of checks.

5. Inefficient power function: The code uses a custom power function `binpow` to calculate powers of a number. This function can be optimized using exponentiation by squaring to reduce the number of multiplications.

Based on these observations, here is the optimization strategy:

1. Remove unnecessary preprocessor macros: Remove all the preprocessor macros that are not essential for the functionality of the code.

2. Replace `vector<bool>` with `bitset`: Replace the `vector<bool>` called `rng` with a `bitset` to save memory.

3. Optimize the calculation of the number of changes: Instead of iterating over the `rng` vector twice, calculate the number of changes in a single loop.

4. Simplify and combine the conditional statements: Simplify and combine the conditional statements to reduce the number of checks.

5. Optimize the power function: Replace the custom power function `binpow` with the optimized exponentiation by squaring algorithm.

Now, let's apply these optimizations step by step in the code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <bitset>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0);
  cin.tie(0);
  cout.tie(0);

  int T;
  cin >> T;

  while (T--) {
    int n;
    cin >> n;

    vector<int> a(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
      cin >> a[i];
    }

    bool sorted = true;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
      if (a[i] != (i + 1)) {
        sorted = false;
        break;
      }
    }

    if (sorted) {
      cout << 0 << endl;
    } else {
      bitset<100000> rng;
      int cng = 0;
      for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        if (a[i] != (i + 1)) {
          rng[i] = 1;
          cng++;
        }
      }

      int cnt = 0;
      for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
        if (rng[i] != rng[i - 1]) {
          cnt++;
        }
      }

      if (cng == 1 || (cng == 2 && (rng[0] || rng[n - 1]))) {
        cout << 1 << endl;
      } else {
        cout << 2 << endl;
      }
    }
  }

  return 0;
}
```

This optimized code removes unnecessary preprocessor macros, replaces `vector<bool>` with `bitset`, optimizes the calculation of the number of changes, simplifies and combines the conditional statements, and removes the custom power function.

The optimized code is more readable, uses a more memory-efficient data structure, reduces unnecessary calculations, and simplifies the conditional statements. It should result in improved performance and reduced memory usage compared to the original code.
