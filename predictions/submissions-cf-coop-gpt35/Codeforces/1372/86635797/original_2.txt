Code Analysis:
- The code is using a lot of unnecessary macros and preprocessor directives. These can be removed to improve code readability.
- The code is using a vector `rng` to store whether each element `a[i]` is in its correct position. However, this vector is not used efficiently and can be optimized.
- The code is using nested loops to check for changes in the `rng` vector. This can be optimized to reduce the number of iterations.
- The code is using multiple if-else statements to determine the output. This can be simplified.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Remove unnecessary macros and preprocessor directives to improve code readability.
2. Optimize the usage of the `rng` vector by using a variable `cng` to keep track of the number of changes.
3. Use a single loop to calculate the number of changes in the `rng` vector, instead of nested loops.
4. Simplify the if-else statements for determining the output by combining conditions.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Remove unnecessary macros and preprocessor directives.
   - Remove `#define endl "\n"`.
   - Remove `#define fr(iter, n) for (ll iter = 0; iter < n; ++iter)`.
   - Remove `#define frr(iter, s, e) for (ll iter = s; iter < e; ++iter)`.
   - Remove `#define rfrr(iter, s, e) for (ll iter = s; iter >= e; --iter)`.
   - Remove `#define watch(x) cerr << (#x) << " is " << (x) << endl;`.
   - Remove `#define pb push_back`.
   - Remove `#define pf push_front`.
   - Remove `#define mpr make_pair`.
   - Remove `#define in insert`.
   - Remove `#define umap unordered_map`.
   - Remove `#define uset unordered_set`.
   - Remove `#define vin(v, n) vi v(n); fr(i, n) cin >> v[i];`.
   - Remove `#define ff first`.
   - Remove `#define ss second`.
   - Remove `#define all(x) (x).begin(), (x).end()`.
   - Remove `#define sz(x) (long long int)(x).size()`.
   - Remove `#define prv(a) for (auto x : a) cout << x << ' '; cout << '\n';`.
   - Remove `#define debv(a) for (auto x : a) cerr << x << ' '; cerr << '\n';`.
   - Remove `#define min3(a, b, c) min(a, min(b, c))`.
   - Remove `#define max3(a, b, c) max(a, max(b, c))`.
   - Remove `#define MOD 1000000007`.
   - Remove `#define fastio ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0); cin.tie(0); cout.tie(0);`.
2. Optimize the usage of the `rng` vector.
   - Instead of using a vector of booleans to store whether each element is in its correct position, we can use a single variable `cng` to keep track of the number of changes.
   - Initialize `cng` to 0 before the loop.
   - Whenever an element `a[i]` is not in its correct position, increment `cng`.
   - This eliminates the need for the `vector<bool> rng` and reduces memory usage.
3. Use a single loop to calculate the number of changes in the `rng` vector.
   - Instead of using nested loops, we can use a single loop to iterate over the elements of `a` and check if each element is in its correct position.
   - Initialize `cng` to 0 before the loop.
   - Iterate over the elements of `a` using a single loop.
   - If an element `a[i]` is not in its correct position, increment `cng`.
   - This reduces the number of iterations and improves efficiency.
4. Simplify the if-else statements for determining the output.
   - Combine conditions to simplify the if-else statements.
   - If `cng` is 0 and the first element of `rng` is 0, output 0.
   - If `cng` is 0, output 1.
   - If `cng` is less than or equal to 2 and either the first or last element of `rng` is 0, output 1.
   - Otherwise, output 2.
