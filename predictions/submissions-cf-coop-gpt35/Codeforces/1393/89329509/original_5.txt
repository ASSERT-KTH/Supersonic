The given code appears to be solving a problem related to counting the number of squares in a given grid. The grid is represented by a 2D array `kek`, and the solution is computed by iterating over each cell of the grid and checking for adjacent cells with the same value.

Upon analysis, the following potential optimizations can be identified:

1. Data Types: The code uses `int` to represent the grid values. However, since the grid values are characters ('0' or '1'), it would be more memory-efficient to use `char` instead of `int`. This change can reduce the memory footprint of the program.

2. Loop Bounds: The loops that iterate over the grid (`i` from 1 to `n-1` and `j` from 1 to `m-1`) can be optimized to reduce the number of iterations. Since the computation of `ul`, `ur`, `dl`, and `dr` depends on the values of the adjacent cells, the loops can be bounded from 1 to `n-1` and from 1 to `m-1` instead of 0 to `n-1` and 0 to `m-1`. This change can avoid unnecessary computations for the boundary cells.

3. Redundant Computations: The calculation of the minimum value in the `ans` computation can be simplified by removing unnecessary nested `min` functions. Instead of `min(ul[i][j], min(ur[i][j], min(dl[i][j], dr[i][j])))`, we can directly use `ul[i][j]`.

4. Compiler Optimizations: The code includes `#pragma` directives to hint the compiler for specific optimizations. However, it is not clear if these optimizations are necessary or effective. It would be beneficial to measure the impact of these directives on the performance of the program and remove them if they do not provide significant improvements.

Based on these optimizations, the optimized code is as follows:
