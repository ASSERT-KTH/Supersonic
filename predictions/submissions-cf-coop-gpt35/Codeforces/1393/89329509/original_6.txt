Code Analysis:
- The code includes several unnecessary includes, such as `<algorithm>`, `<bitset>`, `<iomanip>`, `<map>`, `<math.h>`, `<queue>`, `<random>`, `<set>`, `<stack>`, `<tuple>`, `<unordered_map>`, `<unordered_set>`, and `<vector>`. These should be removed to reduce unnecessary overhead.
- The code defines several macros and typedefs that are not used in the code. These can be removed to simplify the code.
- The code uses a 2D array `kek` to store characters. This can be replaced with a more memory-efficient representation, such as a 1D array or a string.
- The code uses four 2D arrays `ul`, `ur`, `dl`, and `dr` to store the minimum size of a square submatrix with the same characters in each corner. These arrays can be replaced with a more memory-efficient representation, such as a 1D array or a vector.
- The code uses nested loops to iterate over the elements of `kek`. This can be optimized by using a single loop and calculating the indices for `ul`, `ur`, `dl`, and `dr` using a simple formula.
- The code calculates the minimum of four values (`ul[i][j]`, `ur[i][j]`, `dl[i][j]`, `dr[i][j]`) for each element of `kek`. This can be optimized by calculating the minimum value only once and storing it in a variable.
- The code unnecessarily calculates `min(ul[i][j], min(ur[i][j], min(dl[i][j], dr[i][j])))` for each element of `kek`. This can be optimized by calculating the minimum value only once and storing it in a variable.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Remove unnecessary includes to reduce unnecessary overhead.
2. Remove unused macros and typedefs to simplify the code.
3. Replace the 2D array `kek` with a more memory-efficient representation, such as a 1D array or a string.
4. Replace the 2D arrays `ul`, `ur`, `dl`, and `dr` with a more memory-efficient representation, such as a 1D array or a vector.
5. Replace the nested loops with a single loop and calculate the indices for `ul`, `ur`, `dl`, and `dr` using a simple formula.
6. Calculate the minimum value only once and store it in a variable.
7. Calculate `min(ul[i][j], min(ur[i][j], min(dl[i][j], dr[i][j])))` only once and store it in a variable.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Remove unnecessary includes:
   - The code includes several unnecessary headers, such as `<algorithm>`, `<bitset>`, `<iomanip>`, `<map>`, `<math.h>`, `<queue>`, `<random>`, `<set>`, `<stack>`, `<tuple>`, `<unordered_map>`, `<unordered_set>`, and `<vector>`. These should be removed to reduce unnecessary overhead.

2. Remove unused macros and typedefs:
   - The code defines several macros and typedefs that are not used in the code. These can be removed to simplify the code.

3. Replace the 2D array `kek` with a more memory-efficient representation:
   - The code uses a 2D array `kek` to store characters. This can be replaced with a more memory-efficient representation, such as a 1D array or a string. For simplicity, we will replace it with a string.

4. Replace the 2D arrays `ul`, `ur`, `dl`, and `dr` with a more memory-efficient representation:
   - The code uses four 2D arrays `ul`, `ur`, `dl`, and `dr` to store the minimum size of a square submatrix with the same characters in each corner. These arrays can be replaced with a more memory-efficient representation, such as a 1D array or a vector. For simplicity, we will replace them with 1D arrays.

5. Replace the nested loops with a single loop:
   - The code uses nested loops to iterate over the elements of `kek`. This can be optimized by using a single loop and calculating the indices for `ul`, `ur`, `dl`, and `dr` using a simple formula. We will use a single loop and calculate the indices as follows:
     - `ul[i][j]` -> `ul[i * m + j]`
     - `ur[i][j]` -> `ur[i * m + (m - 1 - j)]`
     - `dl[i][j]` -> `dl[(n - 1 - i) * m + j]`
     - `dr[i][j]` -> `dr[(n - 1 - i) * m + (m - 1 - j)]`

6. Calculate the minimum value only once and store it in a variable:
   - The code unnecessarily calculates the minimum of four values (`ul[i][j]`, `ur[i][j]`, `dl[i][j]`, `dr[i][j]`) for each element of `kek`. This can be optimized by calculating the minimum value only once and storing it in a variable.

7. Calculate `min(ul[i][j], min(ur[i][j], min(dl[i][j], dr[i][j])))` only once and store it in a variable:
   - The code unnecessarily calculates `min(ul[i][j], min(ur[i][j], min(dl[i][j], dr[i][j])))` for each element of `kek`. This can be optimized by calculating the minimum value only once and storing it in a variable.
