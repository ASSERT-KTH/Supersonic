Code Analysis:
The given code is a C++ program that solves a problem involving a grid of characters. The program reads the dimensions of the grid and the characters in each cell. It then calculates the maximum size of a square that can be formed by selecting four cells with the same character value. The program uses four arrays (ul, ur, dl, dr) to store the maximum square size for each cell in the grid. Finally, the program calculates the sum of the minimum square sizes for all cells and prints the result.

Potential performance bottlenecks and areas for optimization:
1. Memory usage: The program uses four 2D arrays (ul, ur, dl, dr) to store the maximum square size for each cell in the grid. These arrays have a size of maxn * maxn, where maxn is a constant. This can lead to inefficient memory usage, especially when the grid size is small. It may be possible to optimize the memory usage by using a more efficient data structure.

2. Redundant computations: The program computes the maximum square size for each cell in the grid by checking the values of neighboring cells. However, it performs these computations multiple times, resulting in redundant calculations. This can be optimized by avoiding duplicate computations.

3. Loop optimizations: The program uses nested loops to iterate over the cells of the grid. There may be opportunities to optimize these loops, for example, through loop unrolling or loop interchange.

4. Compiler optimizations: The program includes pragma directives to hint the compiler to optimize certain parts of the code. However, these directives may not be sufficient for optimal performance. It may be necessary to explore additional compiler optimizations to further improve the performance of the code.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Efficient data structures: The current implementation uses 2D arrays to store the maximum square size for each cell in the grid. This can be optimized by using a more efficient data structure, such as a 2D vector or a flat array.

2. Avoid redundant computations: The current implementation performs redundant computations by checking the values of neighboring cells multiple times. This can be optimized by avoiding duplicate calculations and reusing previously computed values.

3. Loop optimizations: The nested loops used to iterate over the cells of the grid can be optimized through loop unrolling or loop interchange. Loop unrolling can reduce loop overhead, while loop interchange can improve cache locality.

4. Compiler optimizations: In addition to the existing pragma directives, additional compiler optimizations can be explored to further improve the performance of the code. These optimizations may include auto-vectorization, loop optimizations, and function inlining.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Efficient data structures: Replace the 2D arrays (ul, ur, dl, dr) with a more efficient data structure, such as a 2D vector or a flat array. This will reduce memory usage and improve cache locality.

2. Avoid redundant computations: Modify the nested loops that compute the maximum square size for each cell to avoid redundant calculations. Instead of recomputing the value for each cell, reuse previously computed values.

3. Loop optimizations: Apply loop unrolling or loop interchange techniques to optimize the nested loops used to iterate over the cells of the grid. Loop unrolling can reduce loop overhead, while loop interchange can improve cache locality.

4. Compiler optimizations: Explore additional compiler optimizations, such as auto-vectorization, loop optimizations, and function inlining. These optimizations can be applied through pragma directives or compiler flags to further improve the performance of the code.
