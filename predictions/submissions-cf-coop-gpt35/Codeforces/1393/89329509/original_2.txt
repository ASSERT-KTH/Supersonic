Code Analysis:
1. The code begins with some pragmas and includes for various libraries.
2. There are several typedefs for different types of vectors and tuples.
3. The main function includes a fast_io() function, which sets some I/O-related settings.
4. The solve() function reads input, performs some calculations, and prints the output.
5. The main function calls the solve() function once.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Remove unnecessary includes: There are several includes that are not being used in the code. These should be removed to improve compilation time.
2. Remove unnecessary typedefs: There are many typedefs defined in the code that are not being used. These should be removed to reduce unnecessary memory usage.
3. Optimize loops: The loops in the code can be optimized by reducing the number of iterations and avoiding unnecessary calculations.
4. Avoid unnecessary function calls: The code makes several function calls that can be avoided to improve performance.
5. Use more efficient data structures: The code currently uses 2D arrays to store the ul, ur, dl, and dr values. These can be replaced with more efficient data structures to reduce memory usage and improve performance.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Remove unnecessary includes: The code includes several libraries that are not being used. These should be removed to improve compilation time. The following includes can be removed: `<algorithm>`, `<bitset>`, `<map>`, `<math.h>`, `<queue>`, `<random>`, `<set>`, `<stack>`, `<tuple>`, `<unordered_map>`, `<unordered_set>`.
2. Remove unnecessary typedefs: The code defines several typedefs for different types of vectors and tuples, but these typedefs are not being used. These should be removed to reduce unnecessary memory usage.
3. Optimize loops:
   - In the first loop in the solve() function, the condition `i < n` can be changed to `i < n-1` since the ul array is accessed as `ul[i-1][j]` inside the loop. This will reduce the number of iterations by 1.
   - In the second loop in the solve() function, the condition `j >= 0` can be changed to `j > 0` since the ur array is accessed as `ur[i-1][j]` inside the loop. This will reduce the number of iterations by 1.
   - In the third loop in the solve() function, the condition `i >= 0` can be changed to `i > 0` since the dl array is accessed as `dl[i+1][j]` inside the loop. This will reduce the number of iterations by 1.
   - In the fourth loop in the solve() function, the condition `i >= 0` can be changed to `i > 0` since the dr array is accessed as `dr[i+1][j]` inside the loop. This will reduce the number of iterations by 1.
4. Avoid unnecessary function calls:
   - The solve() function currently calls `min()` four times in the innermost loop. These calls can be avoided by storing the minimum value in a variable and using it directly in the calculation of `ans`.
5. Use more efficient data structures:
   - The code currently uses 2D arrays (`ul`, `ur`, `dl`, and `dr`) to store the ul, ur, dl, and dr values. These can be replaced with more efficient data structures, such as 2D vectors, to reduce memory usage and improve performance.
