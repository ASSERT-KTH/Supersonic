Code Analysis:
1. The code uses several unnecessary includes, such as <algorithm>, <bitset>, <map>, <queue>, <random>, <set>, <stack>, <unordered_map>, <unordered_set>, <tuple>, <iomanip>, <cmath>, <vector>, and <iostream>. These includes are not used in the code and can be removed.
2. The code uses several unnecessary using statements, such as using namespace std and using std::fixed. These can be removed to avoid unnecessary namespace pollution.
3. The code uses several unnecessary typedefs, such as typedef long long ll and typedef vector<int> vi. These typedefs can be replaced with the actual types to improve code readability.
4. The code uses a large number of unnecessary global variables, such as ul, ur, dl, dr, kek, and ans. These variables can be declared inside the solve() function to improve code modularity and reduce memory usage.
5. The code uses nested for loops to iterate over the matrix kek and compute the ul, ur, dl, and dr arrays. These nested loops can be optimized to reduce the number of iterations and improve performance.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Remove unnecessary includes, using statements, and typedefs to reduce namespace pollution and improve code readability.
2. Move the declaration of ul, ur, dl, dr, kek, and ans inside the solve() function to reduce the scope of these variables and improve code modularity.
3. Optimize the nested for loops by reducing the number of iterations. This can be done by starting the loops from index 1 instead of 0, and ending the loops at n-1 and m-1 instead of n and m. This optimization eliminates unnecessary boundary checks in the if statements.
4. Add loop unrolling optimization to the nested for loops to reduce loop overhead and improve performance.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Remove unnecessary includes, using statements, and typedefs:
- Remove the following includes: <algorithm>, <bitset>, <map>, <queue>, <random>, <set>, <stack>, <unordered_map>, <unordered_set>, <tuple>, <iomanip>, <cmath>, <vector>, and <iostream>.
- Remove the using namespace std statement.
- Remove the using std::fixed statement.
- Replace the typedefs with the actual types: replace typedef long long ll with using ll = long long, and replace typedef vector<int> vi with using vi = vector<int>.

2. Move the declaration of ul, ur, dl, dr, kek, and ans inside the solve() function:
- Move the declaration of ul, ur, dl, dr, and kek inside the solve() function.
- Move the declaration of ans inside the solve() function.

3. Optimize the nested for loops:
- In the first nested for loop, change the initialization of i to 1 and the condition to i < n-1.
- In the second nested for loop, change the initialization of i to n-2 and the condition to i >= 0.
- In the third nested for loop, change the initialization of j to 1 and the condition to j < m-1.
- In the fourth nested for loop, change the initialization of j to m-2 and the condition to j >= 0.

4. Add loop unrolling optimization:
- Unroll the first nested for loop by processing two elements at a time.
- Unroll the second nested for loop by processing two elements at a time.
- Unroll the third nested for loop by processing two elements at a time.
- Unroll the fourth nested for loop by processing two elements at a time.
