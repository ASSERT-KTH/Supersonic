After analyzing the given code, here are some potential optimizations:

1. Avoid unnecessary header inclusion: The line `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` includes a large number of standard library headers, which can impact compilation time. Since only the `iostream` header is required for this program, we can replace `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` with `#include <iostream>`.

2. Remove unused variables: The variables `i` and `q` are declared but not used in the program. We can remove these variables to improve code readability and avoid unnecessary memory allocation.

3. Use a more efficient data structure: The array `d` is used to count the occurrences of each value in `a`. However, since the range of values in `a` is not given, it is better to use a hash map (`unordered_map` in C++) instead of an array. This will provide better efficiency in terms of memory usage and lookup time.

4. Optimize counting: Instead of checking if `d[a[i]] % 2 == 0` and `d[a[i]] % 4 == 0` for each element in `a`, we can increment `k` and `p` directly when `d[a[i]]` becomes even or a multiple of 4. This will reduce the number of modulo operations and improve performance.

5. Optimize queries: Instead of checking the conditions `k >= 4` and `p > 0` for each query, we can maintain a separate variable `canFormRectangle` to track if it is possible to form a rectangle. This variable can be updated whenever a new query is processed, based on the modifications made to `k` and `p`.

Here's the optimized code with the above optimizations implemented:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>

using namespace std;

int main() {
  int n, x;
  cin >> n;

  unordered_map<int, int> d; // Count occurrences of each value in a
  int k = 0; // Number of values with even count
  int p = 0; // Number of values with count multiple of 4

  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> x;
    d[x]++;
    if (d[x] % 2 == 0)
      k++;
    if (d[x] % 4 == 0)
      p++;
  }

  int q;
  cin >> q;

  bool canFormRectangle = (k >= 4 && p > 0); // Check if a rectangle can be formed

  while (q--) {
    char c;
    cin >> c >> x;

    if (c == '+') {
      d[x]++;
      if (d[x] % 2 == 0)
        k++;
      if (d[x] % 4 == 0)
        p++;
    } else {
      d[x]--;
      if (d[x] % 2 != 0)
        k--;
      if (d[x] % 4 == 3)
        p--;
    }

    canFormRectangle = (k >= 4 && p > 0);

    if (canFormRectangle)
      cout << "YES\n";
    else
      cout << "NO\n";
  }

  return 0;
}
```

With these optimizations, the code should run more efficiently and use less memory.
