Code Analysis:
- The code takes an input `n` indicating the size of the array `a[]`.
- It then reads `n` integers into the array `a[]` and keeps track of the count of each element in the array using the `d[]` array.
- The code also keeps track of the count of elements that occur an even number of times (`k`) and the count of elements that occur a multiple of 4 times (`p`).
- After that, the code reads the number of queries `q` and processes each query.
- Each query consists of a character `c` ('+' or '-') and an integer `x`.
- If `c` is '+', the code increments the count of `x` in the `d[]` array and updates `k` and `p` accordingly.
- If `c` is '-', the code decrements the count of `x` in the `d[]` array and updates `k` and `p` accordingly.
- Finally, the code checks if there are at least 4 elements occurring an even number of times (`k >= 4`) and at least one element occurring a multiple of 4 times (`p > 0`). If true, it outputs "YES", otherwise "NO".

Optimization Strategy:
1. Avoid using the `bits/stdc++.h` header, as it includes unnecessary headers and can slow down the compilation process.
2. Replace the global variables with local variables to improve code readability and reduce the scope of variables.
3. Optimize the counting process by using a `map` or `unordered_map` instead of an array. This will reduce the memory usage when the range of elements is large.
4. Instead of checking if `d[a[i]] % 2 == 0` and `d[a[i]] % 4 == 0` for each element in the array, we can update `k` and `p` directly based on the count of each element.
5. Use a loop to process each query instead of a `for` loop with a single statement.
6. Use a separate function to check if the conditions `k >= 4` and `p > 0` are met. This will improve code readability and reusability.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Remove the `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` line and include only the necessary headers.
2. Declare the variables `i`, `n`, `q`, `k`, `x`, `p` as local variables inside the `main()` function.
3. Replace the array `a[]` and `d[]` with a `map` or `unordered_map` to keep track of the count of each element in the array.
4. Instead of updating `k` and `p` using the conditions `d[a[i]] % 2 == 0` and `d[a[i]] % 4 == 0`, update them directly based on the count of each element.
5. Use a loop to process each query instead of a `for` loop with a single statement. This will improve code readability and allow us to handle each query separately.
6. Move the code that checks if `k >= 4` and `p > 0` to a separate function and return a boolean value indicating if the conditions are met.

Optimized Code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>
using namespace std;

bool checkConditions(int k, int p) {
  return k >= 4 && p > 0;
}

int main() {
  int n, q;
  cin >> n;
  
  unordered_map<int, int> countMap;
  int k = 0, p = 0;

  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    int num;
    cin >> num;
    countMap[num]++;
    
    if (countMap[num] % 2 == 0)
      k++;
    if (countMap[num] % 4 == 0)
      p++;
  }

  cin >> q;
  while (q--) {
    char c;
    int x;
    cin >> c >> x;

    if (c == '+') {
      countMap[x]++;
      if (countMap[x] % 2 == 0)
        k++;
      if (countMap[x] % 4 == 0)
        p++;
    } else {
      if (countMap[x] % 2 == 0)
        k--;
      if (countMap[x] % 4 == 0)
        p--;
      countMap[x]--;
    }
    
    if (checkConditions(k, p))
      cout << "YES\n";
    else
      cout << "NO\n";
  }

  return 0;
}
```

This optimized code eliminates the unnecessary header, replaces the global variables with local variables, uses a `unordered_map` to track counts, and separates the conditions check into a separate function. These changes improve code readability and reduce memory usage compared to the original code.
