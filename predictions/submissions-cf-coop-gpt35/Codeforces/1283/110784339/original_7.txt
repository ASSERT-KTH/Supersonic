**Code Analysis:**

1. The code includes unnecessary header files that are not used in the program. These unnecessary includes can be removed to improve compilation time.

2. The code defines several macros for commonly used values. While this can improve code readability, it also increases the size of the compiled code. It is more efficient to directly use the values in the code instead of defining macros for them.

3. The code uses a custom hash function `custom_hash` in an unordered map. However, the hash function implementation is complex and may not provide significant performance improvement over the default hash function. It is worth considering whether the custom hash function is necessary or if the default hash function can be used instead.

4. The code uses a `queue` to store elements during a breadth-first search. While a queue is a suitable data structure for this task, using a `deque` instead of a `queue` can provide better performance due to its constant-time push/pop operations at both ends.

5. The code uses an unordered map `d` to store distances for each element. While this is an efficient choice, the custom hash function used in the unordered map may not be necessary. It is worth considering whether the default hash function can be used instead.

6. The code shuffles the `res` vector using a random number generator. However, the `shuffle` function has a time complexity of O(n) and may not be necessary if the order of elements in `res` does not matter.

7. The code uses `cout` for each element in the `res` vector, which can be slow for a large number of elements. It is more efficient to construct a string with the desired output and then print the entire string at once.

8. The code uses `endl` to end each line of output. However, `endl` flushes the output stream, which can be a performance bottleneck. It is more efficient to use `'\n'` to end each line and manually flush the stream when necessary.

**Optimization Strategy:**

1. Remove unnecessary header files to improve compilation time.
2. Replace macros with direct usage of values to reduce code size.
3. Evaluate the necessity of the custom hash function and consider using the default hash function instead.
4. Replace the `queue` with a `deque` to potentially improve performance.
5. Evaluate the necessity of the custom hash function used in the unordered map and consider using the default hash function instead.
6. Remove the `shuffle` function if the order of elements in `res` does not matter.
7. Use a string to construct the desired output and print the entire string at once.
8. Replace `endl` with `'\n'` to end each line of output and manually flush the stream when necessary.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. Remove unnecessary header files:
   - The `bits/stdc++.h` header includes many standard library headers, which can increase compilation time. Instead, include only the necessary headers for the program.

2. Replace macros with direct usage of values:
   - The macros defined in the code can be replaced with direct usage of the corresponding values. This reduces the size of the compiled code.

3. Evaluate the necessity of the custom hash function:
   - The custom hash function `custom_hash` used in the unordered map can be complex and may not provide significant performance improvement over the default hash function. Consider using the default hash function instead.

4. Replace `queue` with `deque`:
   - The `queue` data structure is used to store elements during a breadth-first search. However, using a `deque` instead of a `queue` can provide better performance due to its constant-time push/pop operations at both ends.

5. Evaluate the necessity of the custom hash function used in the unordered map:
   - The custom hash function `custom_hash` used in the unordered map may not be necessary. Consider using the default hash function instead.

6. Remove `shuffle` function if order of elements in `res` does not matter:
   - If the order of elements in the `res` vector does not matter, the `shuffle` function can be removed. This reduces the time complexity of the program.

7. Use string to construct output and print at once:
   - Instead of printing each element of the `res` vector individually, construct a string with the desired output and print the entire string at once. This reduces the number of output operations and improves performance.

8. Replace `endl` with `'\n'` and manually flush stream:
   - Using `'\n'` instead of `endl` to end each line of output avoids unnecessary stream flushing, which can be a performance bottleneck. Manually flush the stream when necessary.

**Explanation:**

1. Removed unnecessary header files and included only the necessary ones.

2. Replaced macros with direct usage of the corresponding values.

3. Evaluated the necessity of the custom hash function `custom_hash` and used the default hash function instead.

4. Replaced the `queue` with a `deque` to improve performance.

5. Evaluated the necessity of the custom hash function used in the unordered map and used the default hash function instead.

6. Kept the `shuffle` function as it is since the order of elements in `res` matters.

7. Constructed a string `output` with the desired output and printed the entire string at once.

8. Replaced `endl` with `'\n'` to end each line of output and manually flushed the stream when necessary.
