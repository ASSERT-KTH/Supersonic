Code Analysis:
- The code includes various unnecessary header files such as `<bits/stdc++.h>` which includes all standard library headers. It is recommended to include only the required headers to reduce compilation time and improve code readability.
- The code defines numerous macros for commonly used values, but many of them are not used in the given code. This adds unnecessary clutter to the code.
- The code uses a custom hash function `custom_hash` which is not utilized in the program. This can be removed to simplify the code.
- The code uses an unordered_map `d` to store distances associated with each number. However, the distances are only used to calculate the `mini_sum` and are not used elsewhere in the code. This suggests that the unordered_map is unnecessary.
- The code uses a queue `q` to perform breadth-first search (BFS) on the numbers. However, the queue is only used to store numbers that are incremented or decremented from the current number. This can be replaced with a set to store the next numbers to consider, eliminating the need for a queue.
- The code uses a vector `res` to store the selected numbers. The numbers are shuffled at the end, but the order of the numbers does not affect the result. Therefore, shuffling the numbers is unnecessary.
- The code uses the `shuffle` function from the `<algorithm>` header. However, this function is not necessary since the order of the numbers does not affect the result.
- The code uses a while loop to repeatedly call the `solve` function. However, the loop is unnecessary since it only runs once. The variable `t` is not used elsewhere in the code.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Remove unnecessary headers: Remove the unnecessary header files and include only the required headers.
2. Remove unused macros: Remove unused macros to reduce clutter in the code.
3. Remove custom hash function: Remove the unused `custom_hash` struct to simplify the code.
4. Replace unordered_map with set: Replace the unordered_map `d` with a set to store the numbers to be considered in the BFS.
5. Replace queue with set: Replace the queue `q` with a set to store the next numbers to consider in the BFS.
6. Remove unnecessary shuffling: Remove the shuffling of the `res` vector since the order of the numbers does not affect the result.
7. Remove unnecessary while loop: Remove the while loop in the main function since it only runs once.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Remove unnecessary headers: Remove the unnecessary header files and include only the required headers. Since the code does not use any specific functionality from the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header, it can be replaced with the necessary standard headers.
2. Remove unused macros: Remove the unused macros to reduce clutter in the code. The macros `ll`, `ull`, `pb`, `mp`, `F`, `S`, `PI`, `deb`, `deb2`, `pii`, `pll`, `vi`, `vll`, `vull`, `vpii`, `vpll`, `vvi`, `vvll`, `vvull`, `INF`, and `mod` are not used in the code and can be removed.
3. Remove custom hash function: Remove the unused `custom_hash` struct to simplify the code. Since the struct is not used in the code, it can be removed along with the `unordered_map` declaration.
4. Replace unordered_map with set: Replace the unordered_map `d` with a set to store the numbers to be considered in the BFS. Since the distances are not used elsewhere in the code, a set is sufficient to store the numbers.
5. Replace queue with set: Replace the queue `q` with a set to store the next numbers to consider in the BFS. Since the order of the numbers does not matter in the BFS, a set can be used to store the numbers without the need for a queue.
6. Remove unnecessary shuffling: Remove the shuffling of the `res` vector since the order of the numbers does not affect the result. This can be achieved by removing the `shuffle(res.begin(), res.end(), rng);` line.
7. Remove unnecessary while loop: Remove the while loop in the main function since it only runs once. The variable `t` is not used elsewhere in the code.

Optimized Code Block:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_set>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

void solve() {
  int n, m;
  cin >> n >> m;
  vector<int> v(n);
  for (auto &x : v)
    cin >> x;
  unordered_set<int> d;
  unordered_set<int> q;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    d.insert(v[i]);
    q.insert(v[i]);
  }
  vector<int> res;
  int mini_sum = 0;
  while (res.size() < m && !q.empty()) {
    int cur = *q.begin();
    q.erase(cur);
    if (d.count(cur) && d[cur] != 0) {
      res.push_back(cur);
      mini_sum += d[cur];
    }
    if (!d.count(cur - 1)) {
      d[cur - 1] = d[cur] + 1;
      q.insert(cur - 1);
    }
    if (!d.count(cur + 1)) {
      d[cur + 1] = d[cur] + 1;
      q.insert(cur + 1);
    }
  }
  cout << mini_sum << "\n";
  for (auto x : res)
    cout << x << " ";
  cout << "\n";
}

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(nullptr);
  cout.tie(nullptr);
  solve();
  return 0;
}
