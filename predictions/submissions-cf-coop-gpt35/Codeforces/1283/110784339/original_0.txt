Code Analysis:
1. The code includes multiple header files that are not necessary for the given code snippet.
2. The code defines various macros and typedefs that are not used in the code.
3. The code uses a custom hash function and a random number generator, but it's not clear why they are needed for this specific problem.
4. The code uses an unordered_map to store the distance of each number from the given array. However, since the keys are consecutive integers, a simple array or vector can be used instead, which would be more efficient.
5. The code uses a queue to perform a breadth-first search. However, a queue is not necessary here since we only need to process the numbers in the order they were inserted into the map.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Remove unnecessary header files.
2. Remove unused macros and typedefs.
3. Replace the unordered_map with a vector to store the distances.
4. Remove the queue and process the numbers sequentially from the vector.
5. Remove the custom hash function and random number generator since they are not used in the code.
6. Remove the unnecessary while loop in the main function.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Remove unnecessary header files:
   - The code includes `bits/stdc++.h` which includes all the standard library headers. However, it's considered bad practice to include this header as it can increase compilation time. Instead, include only the necessary headers such as `<iostream>` and `<vector>`.

2. Remove unused macros and typedefs:
   - The code defines macros such as `ll`, `ull`, `pb`, `mp`, `F`, `S`, `PI`, etc. These macros are not used anywhere in the code, so they can be safely removed.
   - Similarly, the typedefs for various data types such as `pii`, `pll`, `vi`, `vll`, etc. are not used in the code and can be removed.

3. Replace unordered_map with a vector:
   - The code uses an unordered_map to store the distances of each number from the given array. However, since the keys are consecutive integers, a simple vector can be used instead to store the distances.
   - Replace the line `unordered_map<ll, ll, custom_hash> d;` with `vector<ll> d(n, -1);`.
   - Replace `d[v[i]] = 0LL;` with `d[v[i]] = 0;`.
   - Replace `if (!d.count(cur - 1))` with `if (d[cur - 1] == -1)`.
   - Replace `if (!d.count(cur + 1))` with `if (d[cur + 1] == -1)`.

4. Remove the queue and process numbers sequentially:
   - Instead of using a queue to perform a breadth-first search, we can process the numbers sequentially from the vector.
   - Replace the line `queue<ll> q;` with `vector<ll> q;`.
   - Replace `q.push(v[i]);` with `q.push_back(v[i]);`.
   - Replace `ll cur = q.front(); q.pop();` with `ll cur = q[i]; i++;`.

5. Remove the custom hash function and random number generator:
   - The custom hash function and random number generator are not used in the code, so they can be safely removed.

6. Remove the unnecessary while loop in the main function:
   - The code includes a while loop `while (t--)`. However, the value of `t` is always 1, so the loop can be removed.
