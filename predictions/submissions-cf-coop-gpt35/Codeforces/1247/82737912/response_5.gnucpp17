Upon analyzing the given code, we can identify several areas that can be optimized:

1. Inefficient Data Structures: The code uses nested vectors (`ve<ve<ve<ve<ll>>>>`) to store the `dp` array, which can be quite memory-intensive. Additionally, the `cum` array is also stored as a nested vector. We can use a more memory-efficient data structure, such as a 2D array, to store these arrays.

2. Redundant Computations: The code performs repeated calculations in the loops, which can be avoided by storing the intermediate results in variables. For example, the expressions `dp[i + 1][j + 1][1][0]` and `dp[i + 1][j + 1][1][1]` are calculated multiple times within the loop.

3. Loop Optimization: The nested loops in the code can be optimized by unrolling them. This can reduce the number of loop iterations and improve performance.

4. Compiler Optimizations: We can use compiler optimizations, such as loop unrolling and auto-vectorization, to further improve the performance of the code. We can enable these optimizations using pragmas or compiler flags.
