The given code appears to solve a dynamic programming problem. However, there are several areas where optimization can be applied to improve the efficiency of the code. Let's analyze the code and propose optimization strategies for each part:

1. Import Statements:
   - The code includes unnecessary import statements (`#include <bits/stdc++.h>`, `#include <iostream>`). These should be removed to minimize the compilation time.

2. Macros:
   - The code uses several macros (`#define`) to define constants and functions. While macros can provide convenience, they can also make the code harder to read and debug. It is recommended to replace macros with constants and inline functions to improve code readability and maintainability.

3. Unused Variables:
   - The variables `ll tes` and `ll inf` are defined but not used in the code. These variables should be removed to reduce unnecessary memory usage.

4. Cumulative Arrays:
   - The code uses a 3D cumulative array (`ve<ve<ve<ll>>> cum`) to store cumulative sums of 'R' characters in the input array. However, this array is not necessary for solving the problem, as the cumulative sums can be computed on the fly during the dynamic programming calculations. The cumulative array should be removed to reduce memory usage.

5. Dynamic Programming:
   - The code uses a 4D dynamic programming array (`ve<ve<ve<ve<ll>>>> dp`) to store the intermediate results of the dynamic programming calculations. However, this array has a large memory footprint and can be optimized to reduce memory usage. Instead of using a 4D array, a 2D array can be used to store only the necessary information for each state. Additionally, the use of nested loops can be optimized to reduce redundant calculations.

6. Input/Output:
   - The code uses input/output redirection (`freopen`) to read from the input file and write to the output file. While this can be useful for testing, it is not necessary for the final optimized code. The input/output redirection should be removed to improve the efficiency of the code.
