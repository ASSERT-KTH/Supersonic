Upon analyzing the provided code, we can identify several potential optimization opportunities:

1. Unnecessary includes: The code includes `<bits/stdc++.h>` and `<iostream>` headers, which are not required. We can remove them.

2. Unused macros: There are several macros defined in the code that are not used anywhere. We can remove them to simplify the code.

3. Redundant code: There are a few lines of code that are not necessary. For example, the `inarr` and `outarr` macros are defined but not used. We can remove them.

4. Excessive use of global variables: The code uses a large number of global variables, which can lead to confusion and make it harder to understand and debug the code. We can encapsulate these variables within a class or function to improve code organization.

5. Inefficient data structures: The code uses nested vectors to represent a 3-dimensional array, which can be memory-intensive and slow. We can replace them with more efficient data structures.

6. Redundant calculations: The code performs some calculations multiple times, which can be avoided by storing the results in variables.

Based on these observations, we can formulate the following optimization strategy:

1. Remove unnecessary includes and macros.

2. Encapsulate global variables within a function or class.

3. Replace the nested vectors with a more efficient data structure.

4. Eliminate redundant calculations.

5. Use appropriate compiler optimizations.

Let's now proceed with the step-by-step explanation and provide the optimized code.
