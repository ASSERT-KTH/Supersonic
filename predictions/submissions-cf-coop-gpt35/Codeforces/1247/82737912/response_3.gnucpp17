The given code appears to be solving a dynamic programming problem. However, there are several areas where the code can be optimized for better performance and reduced memory usage.

1. Remove Unnecessary Includes: The code includes two unnecessary headers - `<bits/stdc++.h>` and `<iostream>`. We can remove these includes as they are not used in the code.

2. Avoid Using Macros: The code uses macros for defining constants and for input/output operations. Macros can be error-prone and less readable compared to using constants and functions. It is recommended to replace the macros with const variables and inline functions.

3. Avoid Using Namespaces: The code uses the `using namespace std;` directive, which is considered a bad practice. It is better to use the `std::` prefix for standard library functions and types explicitly.

4. Avoid Excessive Use of Vectors: The code uses multiple nested vectors, which can lead to excess memory usage and slower performance. We can replace some of the vectors with more efficient data structures.

5. Avoid Redundant Computations: The code performs some redundant computations, such as recalculating the same values multiple times. We can optimize these computations to improve performance.

6. Optimize Loops: The code uses nested loops, which can be optimized by reducing unnecessary iterations and applying loop unrolling if applicable.

7. Use Compiler Optimizations: We can use compiler optimizations and pragma directives to hint the compiler to optimize certain parts of the code.
