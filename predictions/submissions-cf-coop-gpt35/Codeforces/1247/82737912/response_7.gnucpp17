First, let's analyze the given code to identify potential performance bottlenecks and inefficient memory usage:

1. The code includes unnecessary header files. We only need `<iostream>` for input/output operations.

2. The code is using `namespace std`, which is generally not recommended as it can cause naming conflicts and increase compilation time.

3. There are several unnecessary macros defined, such as `pb`, `mod`, `inarr`, `outarr`, `ve`, `fi`, `se`, `pa`, `ld`, `__`, `all`, `pii`, `pll`, `fr`, `frn`, `mk`, `setvector`, `sz`, and `deci`. These macros are not used in the code and can be safely removed.

4. The code uses a lot of global variables, including large vectors `arr`, `cum`, and `dp`. Global variables can increase memory usage and make the code harder to read and maintain.

5. The `power` function is not used in the code and can be removed.

6. The `solve` function reads input from the user. It would be more efficient to pass the required variables as function arguments.

7. There are nested loops in the `solve` function, which can potentially be optimized.

8. The code uses nested vectors to represent a 3D array (`cum`) and a 4D array (`dp`). This can lead to inefficient memory usage and slower access times.

Based on these observations, we can formulate an optimization strategy as follows:

1. Remove unnecessary header files and macros.

2. Avoid using `namespace std`.

3. Move the global variables inside the `solve` function and pass them as arguments if needed.

4. Remove the unused `power` function.

5. Optimize the nested loops in the `solve` function, if possible.

6. Replace the nested vectors with more efficient data structures, such as a 1D or 2D array.
