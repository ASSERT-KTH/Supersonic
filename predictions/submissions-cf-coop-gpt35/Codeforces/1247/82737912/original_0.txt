The provided code seems to be solving a dynamic programming problem. However, there are several areas where the code can be optimized for better performance:

1. Remove unnecessary header files: The code includes `<bits/stdc++.h>` and `<iostream>`, but only the latter is being used. We can remove the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header, as it is not required.

2. Avoid using `using namespace std`: While this statement makes the code more concise, it also leads to potential namespace conflicts and decreases code readability. Instead, we can use the `std::` prefix for the standard library functions and types.

3. Remove unused macros: The code includes several macros (`#define`) that are not used in the code. These macros can be removed to reduce unnecessary clutter.

4. Optimize the I/O operations: The code uses `cin` and `cout` for input and output, respectively. However, these operations can be slow for large inputs or outputs. We can use the `scanf` and `printf` functions from the C standard library for faster I/O.

5. Avoid unnecessary data structures: The code uses a 2D vector (`ve<string> arr`) to store the input. However, it is not necessary to store the entire input in memory. We can read the input line by line and process it immediately, without storing it in a separate data structure.

6. Optimize the nested loops: The code contains several nested loops, which can be optimized by rearranging the loop order or using loop unrolling techniques. Additionally, some loops can be eliminated altogether by using cumulative sums or precomputed values.

7. Optimize the dynamic programming calculations: The code performs several dynamic programming calculations using nested loops. We can optimize these calculations by avoiding redundant computations and using memoization techniques.

8. Remove unnecessary comments and pragmas: The code includes several commented lines and pragmas that are not necessary for optimization. We can remove these lines to improve code readability.

Based on these observations, let's proceed with the optimization steps one by one.
