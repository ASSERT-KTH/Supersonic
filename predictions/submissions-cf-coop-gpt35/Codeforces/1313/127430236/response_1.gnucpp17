Upon analyzing the given code, I have identified a few potential areas for optimization:

1. Inefficient Data Structures:
   - The `node` array represents a segment tree, which is used for range queries and updates. However, it is not being efficiently utilized in the current implementation. The `node` array is declared with a size of 4 times the size of the input array `a`, which is unnecessary. Additionally, the `node` array is initialized with all zeroes using `memset`, which is redundant.
   - The `l` and `r` arrays are used to store the left and right sums respectively. However, these arrays are not being utilized efficiently. They can be replaced with a single array or even eliminated altogether by computing the left and right sums on the fly during the traversal.

2. Redundant Computations:
   - The `reverse` function is called twice on the array `a`, which is unnecessary. The second call to `reverse` can be avoided by reversing the traversal direction in the second loop where `r[i]` is calculated.
   - The `update` function is called twice for each element in the array `a` which can be reduced to a single call by updating the segment tree during the initial traversal itself.

3. Loop Optimization:
   - The outer loop from `i = 1` to `n` can be optimized by starting from `i = n` and decrementing `i` until `i = 1`. This eliminates the need for reversing the array `a` twice.

4. Compiler Optimizations:
   - Adding the `#pragma GCC optimize` directive before the `main` function can hint the compiler to apply certain optimizations. For example, `#pragma GCC optimize("O3")` can enable aggressive optimization levels.
