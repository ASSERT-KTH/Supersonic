The provided code performs some kind of dynamic programming to calculate the maximum sum of intervals given certain constraints. However, there are several areas where the code can be optimized for efficiency:

1. Redundant Containers: The code uses two vectors, `states` and `newstates`, to store the state values. The values in these vectors are updated in each iteration of the loop. Instead of creating two separate vectors, we can optimize memory usage by reusing the same vector for both `states` and `newstates`, eliminating the need for unnecessary memory allocation and deallocation.

2. Unnecessary Loop: In the loop where the `newstates` vector is updated, there is no need to loop through all the possible values of `b`. The loop variable `b` only ranges from 0 to (1 << sz) - 1, so we can optimize the loop by iterating through the range directly.

3. Unnecessary Popcount: The code uses `__builtin_popcount` function to calculate the number of set bits in a binary number. However, we can avoid this calculation by using a bit manipulation trick. The number of set bits in a binary number `b` can be obtained by counting the number of iterations needed to zero out all the set bits in `b`. This can be done by using the expression `b = b & (b - 1)` in a loop until `b` becomes zero.

4. Unnecessary Memory Accesses: The code repeatedly accesses the `streams` vector to find the index of a specific element. This can be optimized by using a `std::unordered_map` or `std::unordered_set` to store the indices of the elements in the `streams` vector.

5. Compiler Optimizations: We can add compiler optimizations or pragma directives to hint the compiler to optimize certain parts of the code. For example, we can use `#pragma GCC optimize` to enable optimization flags such as `-O3` or `-march=native` for better performance.

Based on these observations, I will now provide the optimized code.
