Code Analysis:
- The code includes several unnecessary headers that are not used in the program.
- There are several unnecessary functions that are not called from the main function.
- The code uses a lot of unnecessary macros that clutter the code and make it harder to read.
- The code uses a lot of unnecessary typedefs that could be replaced with standard types.
- The code uses inefficient data structures such as vectors for storing states.
- The code includes a lot of unnecessary calculations inside loops.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Remove unnecessary headers: Remove the unnecessary headers that are not used in the program. This will reduce the compilation time and the memory usage.

2. Remove unnecessary functions: Remove the unnecessary functions that are not called from the main function. This will reduce the code size and improve readability.

3. Remove unnecessary macros: Remove the unnecessary macros that clutter the code and make it harder to read. Replace them with standard C++ constructs.

4. Remove unnecessary typedefs: Replace the unnecessary typedefs with standard types. This will improve readability and reduce confusion.

5. Optimize data structures: Replace the inefficient vector data structures with more efficient alternatives. This will reduce memory usage and improve performance.

6. Reduce unnecessary calculations: Identify and remove unnecessary calculations inside loops. This will reduce the computation time and improve performance.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Remove unnecessary headers: Remove the unnecessary headers to reduce the compilation time and memory usage. The unnecessary headers are `<algorithm>`, `<bitset>`, `<cassert>`, `<cmath>`, `<functional>`, `<iomanip>`, `<iostream>`, `<map>`, `<queue>`, `<set>`, `<string.h>`, and `<unordered_map>`.

2. Remove unnecessary functions: Remove the unnecessary functions `printvec`, `printtree`, and `printmap` as they are not called from the main function.

3. Remove unnecessary macros: Remove the unnecessary macros and replace them with standard C++ constructs. The unnecessary macros are `COUT`, `rep`, `all`, `fr`, `sc`, `mp`, `pb`, and `P`.

4. Remove unnecessary typedefs: Replace the unnecessary typedefs with standard types. The unnecessary typedefs are `ll`, `ull`, `P`, and `triple`. Replace them with `long long`, `unsigned long long`, `pair<long long, long long>`, and `tuple<long long, long long, long long>` respectively.

5. Optimize data structures: Replace the inefficient vector data structures with more efficient alternatives. Replace the vectors `states` and `newstates` with arrays. Arrays have a fixed size and are more memory-efficient compared to vectors.

6. Reduce unnecessary calculations: Identify and remove unnecessary calculations inside loops. In the loop where `newstates` is calculated, the calculations `(__builtin_popcount(exp1) % 2)` and `(__builtin_popcount(exp2) % 2)` can be moved outside the loop since they only depend on `gi`. This will reduce the number of calculations inside the loop and improve performance.

The optimized code has removed unnecessary headers, functions, macros, and typedefs. It has also optimized the data structures and reduced unnecessary calculations inside loops. The functionality and output of the original code are preserved in the optimized code.
