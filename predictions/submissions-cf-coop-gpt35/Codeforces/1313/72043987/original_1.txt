The provided code is a C++ program that solves a dynamic programming problem. It reads three integers `n`, `m`, and `k` from the input, and then reads `n` pairs of integers `l` and `r`. The program then performs some calculations and outputs a result. 

To optimize this code, we can focus on the following areas:

1. Memory Usage: The code uses several vectors to store intermediate results. We can analyze these vectors and propose more efficient alternatives if necessary.

2. Loop Optimization: We can analyze the loops in the code and optimize them if possible. This may include loop unrolling or reducing the number of iterations.

3. Compiler Optimizations: We can suggest specific compiler optimizations or pragma directives that can hint the compiler to optimize certain parts of the code.

Now let's analyze the code step by step and propose optimizations.

### Step 1: Memory Usage Analysis

The code uses the following vectors to store intermediate results:

- `vector<vector<ll>> t`: This vector stores `2*n` elements, each containing 3 `ll` values. It is used to store the input pairs `(l, r)`. We can optimize this vector by using a simpler data structure or by reducing the memory usage.

- `vector<ll> states`: This vector stores `1 << k` elements, each containing a `ll` value. It is used to store the intermediate states during the dynamic programming process. We can analyze this vector and propose more memory-efficient alternatives.

- `vector<ll> newstates`: This vector is similar to `states` and is used to store updated states during the dynamic programming process. We can analyze this vector and propose more memory-efficient alternatives.

- `vector<ll> streams`: This vector is used to keep track of the currently active streams. We can analyze this vector and propose more memory-efficient alternatives.

### Step 2: Optimization Strategy

#### Memory Usage Optimization:

1. `vector<vector<ll>> t`: Instead of using a vector of vectors, we can use a simple 2D array to store the input pairs `(l, r)`. This will reduce the memory overhead and improve cache locality.

2. `vector<ll> states` and `vector<ll> newstates`: Instead of using two separate vectors to store the states and updated states, we can use a single vector and swap the contents between iterations. This will eliminate the need to allocate memory for a new vector in each iteration.

3. `vector<ll> streams`: Instead of using a vector to keep track of the currently active streams, we can use a bitmask to represent the active streams. This will reduce the memory usage from `O(n)` to `O(1)`.

#### Loop Optimization:

1. `rep(i, 2 * n)`: The loop iterates over `2 * n` elements of the `t` vector. We can optimize this loop by using a pointer-based approach instead of indexing the vector directly.

2. `rep(b, 1 << sz)`: The loop iterates over `1 << sz` elements. We can optimize this loop by using bitwise operations instead of modulo operations and division operations.

#### Compiler Optimizations:

We can suggest the following compiler optimizations or pragma directives to hint the compiler to optimize certain parts of the code:

- Use compiler flags like `-O2` or `-O3` to enable aggressive optimization.

- Use the `__builtin_popcount` function for better performance in the bitwise operations.

### Step 3: Step-by-Step Explanation

#### Memory Usage Optimization:

1. Replace the `vector<vector<ll>> t` declaration with a simple 2D array. We can use a `vector<ll>` to store the pairs `(l, r)`.

2. Replace the declarations of `vector<ll> states` and `vector<ll> newstates` with a single `vector<ll> states` declaration. We will swap the contents of this vector between iterations.

3. Replace the `vector<ll> streams` declaration with a single `ll streams` declaration. We will use a bitmask to represent the active streams.

#### Loop Optimization:

1. Replace the loop `rep(i, 2 * n)` with a pointer-based loop.

2. Replace the loop `rep(b, 1 << sz)` with a bitwise loop.

#### Compiler Optimizations:

1. Add compiler flags like `-O2` or `-O3` to enable aggressive optimization.

2. Use the `__builtin_popcount` function for better performance in the bitwise operations.
