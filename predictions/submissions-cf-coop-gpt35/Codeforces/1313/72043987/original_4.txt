To optimize the given code, we can focus on the following areas:

1. Memory Usage: The code uses several vectors and maps, which could potentially result in high memory usage. We can explore more memory-efficient alternatives.

2. Redundant Computations: There might be redundant computations and unnecessary operations that can be eliminated to improve efficiency.

3. Loop Optimization: We can optimize loops and recursive calls to reduce the number of iterations and improve overall performance.

4. Compiler Optimizations: We can suggest compiler optimizations or pragma directives that can help the compiler optimize certain parts of the code.

Now, let's go through each of these optimization strategies in detail.

**1. Memory Usage:**

a. `vector<vector<ll>> t(2 * n, vector<ll>(3))`: This vector is used to store the input values for `t`. However, we can optimize memory usage by using a 1D vector instead of a 2D vector. We can store the values in a linear manner and access them using appropriate indices.

b. `vector<ll> states(1 << k, 0)`: This vector is used to store states in the algorithm. Since the elements are accessed using bitwise operations, we can optimize memory usage by using a `bitset` instead of a vector.

c. `vector<ll> newstates(1 << k, 0)`: Similar to the previous vector, we can use a `bitset` instead of a vector to optimize memory usage.

**2. Redundant Computations:**

a. `(__builtin_popcount(exp1) % 2) * (np - pp)`: The expression `__builtin_popcount(exp1) % 2` can be precomputed and stored in a variable, eliminating the need to calculate it multiple times.

b. `(__builtin_popcount(exp2) % 2) * (np - pp)`: Similar to the previous expression, we can precompute `__builtin_popcount(exp2) % 2` and store it in a variable.

**3. Loop Optimization:**

a. Loop Unrolling: We can consider loop unrolling to reduce the number of iterations and improve performance. However, this optimization should be done after addressing other optimization strategies, as it may increase code complexity.

**4. Compiler Optimizations:**

We can suggest enabling compiler optimizations to allow the compiler to perform optimizations automatically. This can be achieved by using compiler flags such as `-O2` or `-O3` during compilation.

Now, let's implement these optimization strategies in the code.
