The provided code is a C++ program that calculates the number of contiguous subarrays with a given greatest common divisor (GCD). The program uses a nested loop to iterate over all possible subarrays and calculates the GCD using a sparse table data structure. The results are stored in a map where the key is the GCD and the value is the count of subarrays with that GCD.

Upon analyzing the code, several potential optimizations can be identified:

1. Avoid unnecessary memory usage:
   - The `ans` map can be replaced with a simple array, where the index represents the GCD and the value represents the count of subarrays with that GCD.
   - The `get_log` array can be reduced in size to `n` instead of `200000`, as it is only used to calculate the size of the sparse table.

2. Optimize the GCD calculation:
   - The `gcd` function can be replaced with the built-in `__gcd` function from the `<algorithm>` header.
   - The GCD calculation in the `get` function can be optimized by using the properties of GCD. Rather than calculating the GCD from scratch for each subarray, we can calculate the GCD incrementally by removing one element from the left and adding one element from the right.

3. Improve the efficiency of the nested loop:
   - The nested loop that iterates over all subarrays can be optimized by using two pointers, `prev_ind` and `now_ind`, to keep track of the current subarray. This eliminates the need for the binary search to find the right endpoint of each subarray.
   - The inner while loop can be simplified by using the `now_gcd` variable instead of calling the `get` function multiple times.

4. Enable compiler optimizations:
   - Compiler optimizations, such as loop unrolling and auto-vectorization, can be enabled using compiler-specific pragmas or flags. These optimizations can improve the performance of the code without changing the logic.

Based on these optimization strategies, the code can be optimized as follows:
