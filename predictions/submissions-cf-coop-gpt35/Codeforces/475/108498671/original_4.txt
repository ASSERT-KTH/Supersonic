The given code is a C++ program that calculates the number of subarrays in an array with a given greatest common divisor (GCD). The program uses a map to store the count of subarrays for each GCD value.

Upon analysis, the following potential optimizations can be made to improve the performance and memory usage of the program:

1. Avoid unnecessary includes: The code includes several unnecessary headers, such as `<cstdio>`, `<cstdlib>`, and `<iostream>`. Since these headers are not used in the code, they can be removed to reduce compile time.

2. Replace `map` with an array: The use of `map` to store the count of subarrays for each GCD value can be replaced with a simple array. Since the GCD values are integers, we can create an array of size 200100 (maximum possible GCD value) to store the count.

3. Avoid unnecessary recursion in `gcd` function: The `gcd` function is implemented using recursion, which can be inefficient for large inputs. Instead, an iterative approach can be used to calculate the GCD.

4. Replace binary search with linear search: The code uses binary search to find the upper bound of the subarray range with a given GCD. However, since the range is small (n), a linear search can be used instead, which will be faster.

5. Remove unnecessary intermediate variables: There are several unnecessary intermediate variables, such as `prev_ind` and `now_ind`, which can be removed to simplify the code.

6. Use `std::vector` instead of fixed-size arrays: The code uses fixed-size arrays (`a` and `st`) with a size of 100100, which may lead to unnecessary memory allocation. Using `std::vector` instead will allow dynamic resizing as needed.

7. Use `std::cout` instead of `printf`: The code uses `printf` to print the result. Using `std::cout` instead can simplify the code and improve readability.

8. Optimize loop variables and conditions: The loop variables and conditions can be optimized to avoid unnecessary calculations and comparisons.

Based on these optimizations, the optimized code is as follows:
