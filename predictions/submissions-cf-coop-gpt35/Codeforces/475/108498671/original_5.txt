The provided code calculates the number of subarrays in an array `a` that have a greatest common divisor (GCD) equal to a given query value `x`. The code uses a sparse table (`st`), along with a binary search, to efficiently calculate the GCD of any subarray in logarithmic time complexity.

However, there are several areas where the code can be optimized:

1. Unnecessary use of `map`: The `ans` variable is declared as a `map`, which can be inefficient for large inputs. Since the query values are integers, we can use an array instead of a `map` to store the results.

2. Redundant calculations in the binary search: The current binary search implementation recalculates the GCD for each iteration. We can optimize this by calculating the GCD only once and storing it in a variable.

3. Inefficient memory usage: The `st` array uses a 2D structure, which may result in inefficient memory usage. We can optimize this by using a 1D array instead.

4. Unnecessary calculations in `get_log` array: The `get_log` array is pre-calculated to store the logarithmic value of indices. However, the values of `get_log[i]` can be directly calculated using `log2()` function.

5. Use of `scanf()` and `printf()`: The use of `scanf()` and `printf()` can be replaced with faster alternatives like `cin` and `cout` respectively.

Now, let's proceed with the optimization steps one by one:

Step 1: Remove unnecessary header files
The `cstdlib` and `iostream` header files are not used in the code and can be removed.

```cpp
#include <cstdio>
#include <map>
```

Step 2: Replace `map` with an array
The `ans` variable is declared as a `map<int, long long>`. We can replace it with an array of size `200100`, as the query values are integers.

```cpp
long long ans[200100] = {0};
```

Step 3: Optimize the binary search
In the current implementation, the binary search recalculates the GCD for each iteration. We can optimize this by calculating the GCD only once and storing it in a variable.

```cpp
int now_gcd = get(L, now_ind + 1);
int l = now_ind;
int r = n;
while (r - l > 1) {
  int m = (l + r) / 2;
  int x = get(L, m + 1);
  if (x < now_gcd)
    r = m;
  else
    l = m;
}
```

Step 4: Optimize the `st` array
The `st` array uses a 2D structure, which may result in inefficient memory usage. We can optimize this by using a 1D array instead. Additionally, we can remove the unnecessary calculation of `nowP - 1` in the loop condition.

```cpp
int st[100100] = {0};
```

```cpp
for (int nowP = 1; nowP < 20; nowP++) {
  for (int i = 0; i + (1LL << nowP) <= n; i++) {
    st[i] = gcd(st[i], st[i + (1LL << (nowP - 1))]);
  }
}
```

Step 5: Optimize the `get_log` array
The `get_log` array is pre-calculated to store the logarithmic value of indices. However, the values of `get_log[i]` can be directly calculated using the `log2()` function.

```cpp
for (int i = 2; i < 200100; i++) {
  get_log[i] = log2(i);
}
```

Step 6: Replace `scanf()` and `printf()` with `cin` and `cout`
The use of `scanf()` and `printf()` can be replaced with the faster alternatives `cin` and `cout` respectively.

```cpp
cin >> n;
for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
  cin >> a[i];
}
```

```cpp
cout << ans[x] << "\n";
```

Here's the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <cstdio>
#include <map>
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>
using namespace std;

int gcd(int a, int b) {
  if (b == 0) {
    return a;
  }
  return gcd(b, a % b);
}

int n;
int q;
long long ans[200100] = {0};
int a[100100];
int st[100100] = {0};
int get_log[200100] = {0};

int get(int l, int r) {
  int sz = log2(r - l);
  return gcd(st[l], st[r - (1LL << sz)]);
}

int main() {
  for (int i = 2; i < 200100; i++) {
    get_log[i] = log2(i);
  }
  
  cin >> n;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> a[i];
  }
  
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    st[i] = a[i];
  }
  
  for (int nowP = 1; nowP < 20; nowP++) {
    for (int i = 0; i + (1LL << nowP) <= n; i++) {
      st[i] = gcd(st[i], st[i + (1LL << (nowP - 1))]);
    }
  }
  
  for (int L = 0; L < n; L++) {
    int prev_ind = L;
    int now_ind = L;
    while (now_ind < n) {
      int now_gcd = get(L, now_ind + 1);
      int l = now_ind;
      int r = n;
      while (r - l > 1) {
        int m = (l + r) / 2;
        int x = get(L, m + 1);
        if (x < now_gcd)
          r = m;
        else
          l = m;
      }
      ans[now_gcd] += r - prev_ind;
      now_ind = r;
      prev_ind = r;
    }
  }
  
  cin >> q;
  while (q--) {
    int x;
    cin >> x;
    cout << ans[x] << "\n";
  }
  
  return 0;
}
```

The optimized code reduces memory usage by using a 1D array instead of a 2D array, replaces `map` with an array, and optimizes the binary search. It also replaces `scanf()` and `printf()` with faster alternatives `cin` and `cout`.
