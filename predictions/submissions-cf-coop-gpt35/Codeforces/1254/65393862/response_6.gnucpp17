Code Analysis:
1. The code uses the `mod_int` struct to perform arithmetic operations on modulo 998244353. This struct includes overloaded operators for arithmetic operations, as well as functions for modular inverse and exponentiation.
2. The code uses the `RMQ` class to perform range minimum queries on a given vector of values.
3. The code uses the `LCA` class to perform Lowest Common Ancestor queries on a given tree.
4. The main function reads input values, constructs the LCA tree, and processes queries based on their type.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Improve Memory Usage:
   - The `values` vector can be optimized by using a `vector<mod_int>` instead of `vector<int>`. This will reduce the memory usage and eliminate the need for explicit type conversions.
   - The `updates` and `query_d` vectors can also be optimized to use `vector<mod_int>` instead of `vector<int>`.
   - The `range_low` vector in the `RMQ` class can be optimized by using a 1D vector instead of a 2D vector. This can be achieved by flattening the 2D vector into a 1D vector using a simple index calculation.
2. Avoid Redundant Computations:
   - The calculations of `inv_N` and `probability` can be moved outside the loop to avoid redundant calculations for each query.
   - The calculations of `base_probability` and `1 - base_probability` can be moved outside the loop to avoid redundant calculations for each node.
3. Compiler Optimizations:
   - Enable compiler optimizations by using compiler-specific pragmas or flags.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Replace `values` vector with `vector<mod_int>`:
   - Replace the declaration `vector<mod_int> values` with `vector<mod_int> values(N, 0)`.
   - This change reduces memory usage and eliminates the need for explicit type conversions during arithmetic operations.

2. Replace `updates` and `query_d` vectors with `vector<mod_int>`:
   - Replace the declarations `vector<int> updates, query_d` with `vector<mod_int> updates(N, 0), query_d(N, 0)`.
   - This change reduces memory usage and eliminates the need for explicit type conversions during arithmetic operations.

3. Optimize `range_low` vector in the `RMQ` class:
   - Replace the declaration `vector<vector<int>> range_low` with `vector<int> range_low`.
   - In the `build` function of the `RMQ` class, flatten the 2D vector `range_low` into a 1D vector using the following calculation:
     ```cpp
     range_low[i * n + j] = better_index(range_low[(i - 1) * n + j], range_low[(i - 1) * n + (j + (1 << (i - 1)))]);
     ```

4. Move calculations of `inv_N` and `probability` outside the loop:
   - Before the loop that processes the queries, calculate `inv_N` and `probability` as follows:
     ```cpp
     mod_int inv_N = mod_int(1) / N;
     mod_int probability = (N - lca.subtree_size[ca]) * inv_N;
     ```

5. Move calculations of `base_probability` and `1 - base_probability` outside the loop:
   - Before the loop that processes the queries, calculate `base_probability` and `1 - base_probability` as follows:
     ```cpp
     vector<mod_int> base_probabilities(N);
     for (int node = 0; node < N; node++)
       base_probabilities[node] = lca.subtree_size[node] * inv_N;
     vector<mod_int> one_minus_base_probabilities = mod_int(1) - base_probabilities;
     ```

6. Enable compiler optimizations:
   - Add compiler-specific pragmas or flags to enable optimizations. For example, use `#pragma GCC optimize("O3")` for GCC or `-O3` flag for Clang.
