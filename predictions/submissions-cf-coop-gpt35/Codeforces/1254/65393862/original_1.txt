Code Analysis:

1. The code defines a structure `mod_int` which represents a modular integer with arithmetic operations.
2. The code also defines a template structure `RMQ` which performs range minimum queries on a given array.
3. The code defines a structure `LCA` which represents a Lowest Common Ancestor data structure.
4. The main function reads input values and performs queries using the LCA structure and the mod_int structure.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The code includes unnecessary headers such as `<algorithm>`, `<cassert>`, `<cmath>`, and `<iostream>`. These headers should be removed to reduce compilation time and improve efficiency.

2. Avoid unnecessary conversions: The mod_int structure has an explicit conversion operator to int. This conversion can be avoided to reduce unnecessary conversions and improve efficiency.

3. Optimize mod_inv function: The mod_inv function in the mod_int structure can be optimized by using the extended Euclidean algorithm instead of the current implementation. This will improve the efficiency of the mod_inv function.

4. Use a more efficient data structure for range_low: The range_low vector in the RMQ structure can be replaced with a 2D array to improve cache performance and reduce memory usage.

5. Optimize build function in RMQ: The build function in the RMQ structure can be optimized by using loop unrolling to reduce the number of comparisons and assignments.

6. Optimize add_edge function in LCA: The add_edge function in the LCA structure can be optimized by using move semantics to avoid unnecessary copies of vectors.

7. Optimize dfs function in LCA: The dfs function in the LCA structure can be optimized by using tail recursion to avoid unnecessary function calls and improve efficiency.

8. Avoid unnecessary copies in main function: The main function uses unnecessary copies of vectors. These copies can be avoided to reduce memory usage and improve efficiency.

9. Optimize query processing in main function: The main function processes queries by iterating over the pending_queries vector. This can be optimized by using a more efficient data structure, such as a priority queue or a hashmap, to store and process the pending queries.

Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. Remove unnecessary includes:
   - Remove the unnecessary includes `<algorithm>`, `<cassert>`, `<cmath>`, and `<iostream>`.

2. Avoid unnecessary conversions:
   - Remove the explicit conversion operator from the mod_int structure.

3. Optimize mod_inv function:
   - Replace the mod_inv function in the mod_int structure with an optimized implementation using the extended Euclidean algorithm.

4. Use a more efficient data structure for range_low:
   - Replace the vector<vector<int>> range_low with a 2D array to improve cache performance and reduce memory usage.

5. Optimize build function in RMQ:
   - Optimize the build function in the RMQ structure by using loop unrolling to reduce the number of comparisons and assignments.

6. Optimize add_edge function in LCA:
   - Optimize the add_edge function in the LCA structure by using move semantics to avoid unnecessary copies of vectors.

7. Optimize dfs function in LCA:
   - Optimize the dfs function in the LCA structure by using tail recursion to avoid unnecessary function calls.

8. Avoid unnecessary copies in main function:
   - Avoid unnecessary copies of vectors in the main function by using references or move semantics.

9. Optimize query processing in main function:
   - Optimize the processing of queries in the main function by using a more efficient data structure, such as a priority queue or a hashmap, to store and process the pending queries.
