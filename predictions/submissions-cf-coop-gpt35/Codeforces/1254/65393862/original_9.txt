After analyzing the provided code, I have identified a few potential performance bottlenecks and areas for optimization:

1. Inefficient Data Structures: The code uses several data structures, including vectors and a custom RMQ class, which may not be the most efficient for the given problem. We need to analyze if there are more efficient alternatives available.

2. Redundant Computations: The code performs repetitive computations in the main loop, especially when calculating the answer for type 2 queries. We need to optimize these computations to reduce unnecessary work.

3. Inefficient Memory Usage: The code uses several vectors and other data structures to store and process data. We need to analyze if there are any unnecessary memory allocations or inefficient memory usages that can be optimized.

4. Compiler Optimizations: We can explore compiler optimizations or pragma directives that can hint the compiler to optimize certain parts of the code. This can further improve the performance of the program.

Now, let's proceed with the optimization strategy and explain each optimization step in detail.
