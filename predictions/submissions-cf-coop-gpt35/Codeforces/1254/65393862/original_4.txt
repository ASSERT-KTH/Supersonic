The provided code is a C++ program that performs queries on a tree structure. The program reads an input tree and a series of queries from the standard input, and then calculates and outputs the results of the queries.

Upon analyzing the code, we can identify several potential areas for optimization:

1. Redundant calculations: There are several calculations that are repeated unnecessarily. For example, in the `get_dist` function of the `LCA` struct, the depth of the LCA node is calculated twice.

2. Inefficient data structures: The code uses several data structures, such as vectors and matrices, which may not be the most efficient for the given problem. For example, the `range_low` matrix in the `RMQ` struct could be replaced with a more efficient data structure.

3. Unoptimized loops: There are several loops in the code that can potentially be optimized. For example, the loop in the `build` function of the `LCA` struct could be optimized by using loop unrolling.

4. Compiler optimizations: There are several places in the code where compiler optimizations can be applied, such as loop unrolling or vectorization. Adding appropriate compiler pragmas or directives can hint the compiler to optimize these sections.

Based on these observations, we can formulate an optimization strategy as follows:

1. Remove redundant calculations: Identify and eliminate any calculations that are repeated unnecessarily. For example, in the `get_dist` function of the `LCA` struct, calculate the depth of the LCA node only once and store it in a variable.

2. Optimize data structures: Replace inefficient data structures with more efficient alternatives. For example, replace the `range_low` matrix in the `RMQ` struct with a more efficient data structure, such as a segment tree.

3. Optimize loops: Identify and optimize loops that can be further improved. For example, in the `build` function of the `LCA` struct, apply loop unrolling to improve performance.

4. Apply compiler optimizations: Add appropriate compiler pragmas or directives to hint the compiler to optimize certain sections of the code. For example, use pragmas to enable loop unrolling or vectorization.

Now let's proceed with the step-by-step explanation of each optimization step.
