Code Analysis:
- The code includes several data structures and algorithms, such as mod_int, RMQ, and LCA.
- The mod_int struct is used to perform arithmetic operations modulo a given value (MOD).
- The RMQ struct implements the Range Minimum Query algorithm to efficiently find the minimum value in a range of values.
- The LCA struct is used to find the Lowest Common Ancestor of two nodes in a tree.
- The main function reads input values, builds the LCA structure, and processes queries.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Replace the vector<T> values in RMQ with a dynamic array to reduce memory overhead. This will also improve cache locality.
2. Avoid unnecessary calculations by removing the inv_N variable and calculating the base_probability directly.
3. Avoid repeated calculations of subtree sizes by storing them in an array.
4. Use loop unrolling to improve the efficiency of for loops.
5. Use compiler optimizations (e.g., inline functions, loop optimizations) to improve performance.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Replace the vector<T> values in RMQ with a dynamic array:
   - The current implementation uses a vector to store the values in RMQ. However, vectors have a memory overhead due to their dynamic size.
   - By replacing the vector with a dynamic array, we can reduce the memory overhead and improve cache locality.
   - To implement this optimization, replace the following line:
     ```cpp
     vector<T> values;
     ```
     with:
     ```cpp
     T* values;
     ```

2. Avoid unnecessary calculations by removing the inv_N variable:
   - The code currently calculates inv_N as mod_int(1) / N. However, this calculation is performed for each query, even though N remains constant.
   - To avoid the unnecessary calculation, remove the inv_N variable and calculate the base_probability directly.
   - To implement this optimization, replace the following line:
     ```cpp
     mod_int inv_N = mod_int(1) / N;
     ```
     with:
     ```cpp
     mod_int base_probability = mod_int(1) / N;
     ```

3. Avoid repeated calculations of subtree sizes:
   - The code currently calculates the subtree sizes for each node in the LCA structure every time a query is processed.
   - To avoid the repeated calculations, store the subtree sizes in an array during the LCA initialization.
   - To implement this optimization, add the following code after the "euler.push_back(node);" line in the "dfs" function of the LCA struct:
     ```cpp
     subtree_size[node] += subtree_size[child];
     ```

4. Use loop unrolling:
   - Loop unrolling can improve the efficiency of for loops by reducing loop overhead and improving instruction-level parallelism.
   - To apply loop unrolling, replace the for loops in the main function with unrolled versions.
   - To implement this optimization, replace the for loop in the main function with the following code:
     ```cpp
     for (int q = 0; q < Q; q += 4) {
       // Process 4 queries at a time
       for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
         int q_idx = q + i;
         if (q_idx >= Q) {
           break;
         }
         // Process the query
       }
     }
     ```

5. Use compiler optimizations:
   - Compiler optimizations can significantly improve the performance of the code without manual changes.
   - To enable compiler optimizations, add the following line at the beginning of the code:
     ```cpp
     #pragma GCC optimize("O3")
     ```

Optimized Code:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <cassert>
#include <cmath>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;
const int MOD = 998244353;
struct mod_int {
  int val;
  mod_int(long long v = 0) {
    if (v < 0)
      v = v % MOD + MOD;
    if (v >= MOD)
      v %= MOD;
    val = v;
  }
  static int mod_inv(int a, int m = MOD) {
    int g = m, r = a, x = 0, y = 1;
    while (r != 0) {
      int q = g / r;
      g %= r;
      swap(g, r);
      x -= q * y;
      swap(x, y);
    }
    return x < 0 ? x + m : x;
  }
  explicit operator int() const { return val; }
  mod_int &operator+=(const mod_int &other) {
    val += other.val;
    if (val >= MOD)
      val -= MOD;
    return *this;
  }
  mod_int &operator-=(const mod_int &other) {
    val -= other.val;
    if (val < 0)
      val += MOD;
    return *this;
  }
  static unsigned fast_mod(uint64_t x, unsigned m = MOD) {
#if !defined(_WIN32) || defined(_WIN64)
    return x % m;
#endif
    unsigned x_high = x >> 32, x_low = (unsigned)x;
    unsigned quot, rem;
    asm("divl %4\n" : "=a"(quot), "=d"(rem) : "d"(x_high), "a"(x_low), "r"(m));
    return rem;
  }
