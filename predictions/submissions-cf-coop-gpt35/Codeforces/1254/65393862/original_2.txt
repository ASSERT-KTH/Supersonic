Code Analysis:
1. The code uses the RMQ (Range Minimum Query) data structure to efficiently compute the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two nodes in a tree.
2. The code maintains a vector of values for each node in the tree.
3. The code processes a series of queries, where each query can be of three types:
    a. Type 1: Update the value of a node.
    b. Type 2: Compute the sum of values along the path from a node to the root, considering the updates made so far.
    c. Type 3: Invalid query type.
4. The code uses a vector to store pending queries that have not been processed yet.
5. The updates to the values are applied in batches, where each batch contains a maximum of APPLY queries. The value updates are computed using the LCA data structure.

Potential Optimizations:
1. Use a more efficient data structure than the vector to store the values of each node. The current implementation requires linear time for value updates and queries.
2. Optimize the batch processing of updates to reduce the number of computations and memory usage.
3. Reduce the number of redundant computations by avoiding unnecessary updates and queries.
4. Utilize compiler optimizations and pragmas to hint the compiler to optimize certain parts of the code.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Replace the vector used to store the values of each node with a dynamically allocated array. This will reduce memory usage and improve cache performance.
2. Refactor the code to process updates and queries in a single pass instead of using batches. This will eliminate redundant computations and reduce memory usage.
3. Optimize the computation of the updates by avoiding unnecessary calculations and simplifying the logic.
4. Use compiler optimizations and pragmas to improve the performance of the code.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Replace the vector used to store the values of each node with a dynamically allocated array:
   - Replace the vector `values` with a dynamically allocated array `values` of type `mod_int*`.
   - Update the code to allocate and deallocate the array using `new` and `delete[]` respectively.
   - Modify the code to access the array elements using the pointer notation `values[node]` instead of `values[node]`.
   - This optimization reduces memory usage and improves cache performance by eliminating the overhead of the vector data structure.

2. Refactor the code to process updates and queries in a single pass:
   - Remove the `APPLY` variable and the batch processing logic.
   - Replace the vector `updates` and `query_d` with a dynamically allocated array `updates` of type `mod_int*`.
   - Update the code to allocate and deallocate the array using `new` and `delete[]` respectively.
   - Modify the code to access the array elements using the pointer notation `updates[node]` instead of `updates[node]`.
   - This optimization eliminates redundant computations and reduces memory usage by processing updates and queries in a single pass.

3. Optimize the computation of the updates:
   - Update the code to compute the updates in a more efficient manner.
   - Instead of updating the values of all nodes, only update the values of the nodes affected by the queries.
   - Simplify the logic for computing the updates by avoiding unnecessary calculations.
   - This optimization reduces the number of computations and improves the efficiency of the updates.

4. Use compiler optimizations and pragmas:
   - Add compiler optimizations flags to enable compiler optimizations.
   - Use pragma directives to guide the compiler to optimize certain parts of the code.
   - For example, use pragma directives to optimize loops or hint the compiler to inline certain functions.
   - These compiler optimizations can significantly improve the performance of the code.
