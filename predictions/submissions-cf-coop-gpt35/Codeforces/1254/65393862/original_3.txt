The provided code is a C++ program that performs queries on a tree structure. The program uses the Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA) algorithm to calculate the LCA of two nodes in the tree. The program also supports two types of queries:

1. Type 1 query: Add a value to a specific node in the tree.
2. Type 2 query: Calculate the sum of values of all nodes on the path from a specific node to the root.

The code uses several data structures and algorithms, such as the RMQ (Range Minimum Query) algorithm and the mod_int class for modular arithmetic.

To optimize the code for efficiency, we can focus on the following areas:

1. Memory Usage: Analyze the memory usage of the program and identify any unnecessary or inefficient data structures. Look for opportunities to reduce memory usage by using more efficient alternatives.

2. Loop Optimization: Identify any loops or recursive calls that can be optimized. Consider loop unrolling, loop fusion, or tail recursion to reduce the number of iterations.

3. Compiler Optimization: Utilize compiler optimizations or pragma directives to hint the compiler to optimize certain parts of the code. This can include loop optimizations, vectorization, or inlining of functions.

4. Algorithmic Optimization: Analyze the algorithms used in the code and look for any potential optimizations. Consider alternative algorithms or data structures that can improve the performance of the program.

We will now proceed with the step-by-step explanation of each optimization step.
