Code Analysis:
1. The code defines a struct `mod_int` that represents a modular integer. It overloads various operators to perform arithmetic operations on modular integers efficiently.
2. The code also defines a struct `RMQ` that represents a range minimum query data structure. It uses a sparse table to efficiently answer range minimum queries.
3. The code defines a struct `LCA` that represents a Lowest Common Ancestor data structure. It uses a depth-first search to preprocess the tree and answer LCA queries efficiently.
4. The code defines a struct `query` that represents a query on the tree. It has two fields: `type` (1, 2, or 3) and `v` (the vertex number).
5. The code reads the number of vertices `N` and the number of queries `Q` from the input.
6. The code initializes the LCA data structure with the number of vertices `N`.
7. The code reads the edges of the tree and adds them to the LCA data structure.
8. The code builds the LCA data structure.
9. The code initializes a vector `values` with size `N` to store the values of the vertices.
10. The code initializes a vector `pending_queries` to store the pending queries.
11. The code initializes a modular integer `inv_N` with the inverse of `N`.
12. The code processes each query:
   - If the query type is 1, it reads an integer `d` and adds the query to the `pending_queries` vector.
   - If the query type is 2, it calculates the answer by iterating over the `pending_queries` vector and performing the required calculations.
   - If the query type is 3, it asserts false (this case is not handled).
   - If the number of pending queries exceeds a threshold (`APPLY`), it processes the pending queries by updating the `values` vector and the `updates` vector.
13. The code outputs the answers to the queries.

Potential optimizations:
1. The `mod_int` struct can be optimized by using a fixed modulus instead of a dynamic modulus. This will eliminate the need for modulus calculations in most operations.
2. The `RMQ` struct can be optimized by using a more efficient data structure, such as a segment tree or a Cartesian tree.
3. The `LCA` struct can be optimized by using a more efficient algorithm, such as Tarjan's algorithm or Farach-Colton and Bender's algorithm.
4. The `values` and `updates` vectors can be optimized by using a compressed data structure that only stores non-zero values.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Optimization of the `mod_int` struct:
   - Replace the dynamic modulus `MOD` with a fixed modulus.
   - Remove the modulus calculations in the constructor and the `mod_inv` function.
   - Remove the `fast_mod` function and replace it with a simple modulus operation.
   - Remove the `operator-` function and replace it with a negation operation.
   - Remove the `operator++(int)` and `operator--(int)` functions and replace them with the pre-increment and pre-decrement operators.
   - Remove the `operator==` and `operator!=` functions and replace them with the equality and inequality operators.
   - Remove the `inv` function and replace it with the `mod_inv` function.
   - Remove the `pow` function and replace it with a loop that performs modular exponentiation.

   a. Replace the dynamic modulus `MOD` with a fixed modulus. This will eliminate the need for modulus calculations in most operations.
   b. Remove the modulus calculations in the constructor and the `mod_inv` function. The fixed modulus will ensure that the values are always within the valid range.
   c. Remove the `fast_mod` function and replace it with a simple modulus operation. The fixed modulus will ensure that the values are always within the valid range.
   d. Remove the `operator-` function and replace it with a negation operation. The fixed modulus will handle the negative values correctly.
   e. Remove the `operator++(int)` and `operator--(int)` functions and replace them with the pre-increment and pre-decrement operators. The fixed modulus will handle the overflow and underflow correctly.
   f. Remove the `operator==` and `operator!=` functions and replace them with the equality and inequality operators. The fixed modulus will handle the comparison correctly.
   g. Remove the `inv` function and replace it with the `mod_inv` function. This will simplify the code and improve readability.
