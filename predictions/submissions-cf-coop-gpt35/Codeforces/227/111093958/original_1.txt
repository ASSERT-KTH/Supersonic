The given code reads an input array `a` of size `n` and calculates two sums based on the input values `x`. The first sum (`first`) is the sum of indices of `a` where the input value `x` is found, plus 1. The second sum (`second`) is the sum of the difference between `n` and the index of `a` where the input value `x` is found. The code then prints out the values of `first` and `second`.

To optimize this code, we can focus on the following areas:

1. Eliminate unnecessary memory usage: The array `was` is used to store the index of each value in `a`. However, the values in `a` are integers ranging from 1 to `n`, so we can use a more memory-efficient data structure to store the indices.

2. Improve input/output performance: The code currently uses `cin` and `cout` for input/output operations, which can be slower compared to other methods such as using `scanf` and `printf`.

3. Minimize the number of iterations: The code contains two loops that iterate over the input array `a`. We can optimize these loops to reduce the number of iterations and improve performance.

4. Utilize compiler optimizations: We can use compiler optimizations and pragma directives to hint the compiler to optimize certain parts of the code.

Now, let's proceed with the step-by-step optimization process.
