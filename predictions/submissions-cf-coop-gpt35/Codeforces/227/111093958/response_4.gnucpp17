The given code reads an integer `n`, followed by an array `a` of size `n`, and then reads another integer `m`. It then performs a series of calculations based on the values in `a` and `m`, and finally prints the values of `first` and `second`.

Upon analyzing the code, here are some potential areas for optimization:

1. The array `was` is used to store the indices of the elements in `a`. Since the values in `a` are in the range [0, n-1], we can use a more memory-efficient data structure to achieve the same functionality.

2. The code uses `cin` and `cout` for input and output operations. These standard I/O functions have a performance overhead compared to the lower-level I/O functions. We can optimize the I/O operations by using `scanf` and `printf` instead.

3. The code uses a loop to calculate the values of `first` and `second`. We can optimize this loop by eliminating unnecessary additions and subtractions.
