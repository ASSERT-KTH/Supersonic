Code Analysis:
1. The main function takes an integer input 'n'.
2. If 'n' is less than 25, it prints -1 and exits.
3. Otherwise, it creates a vector 'v' to store pairs of factors of 'n'.
4. It iterates from 1 to the square root of 'n' and checks if 'n' is divisible by 'i'. If it is, it adds 'i' and 'n/i' as a pair to 'v'.
5. It checks if the last pair in 'v' has both elements greater than or equal to 5.
6. If it does, it assigns the last pair's first element to 'r' and the second element to 'c'.
7. It creates an array 'vow' containing the vowels 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'.
8. It initializes an integer 'imain' to 0.
9. It iterates 'r' times and initializes an integer 'icopy' to 'imain' modulo 5.
10. It iterates 'c' times and prints the character at index 'icopy' in the 'vow' array. It then updates 'icopy' to (icopy + 1) modulo 5.
11. It updates 'imain' to (imain + 1) modulo 5.
12. If the condition in step 5 is not satisfied, it prints -1 and exits.

Optimization Strategy:
1. The 'ans' function is not called anywhere in the code, so it can be removed.
2. The 'vector' data structure is used to store pairs of factors of 'n'. However, since we only need the last pair, we can simply use two integer variables instead of a vector.
3. The 'sqrt' function is called in the loop condition to calculate the square root of 'n' repeatedly. This can be avoided by calculating the square root once and storing it in a variable.
4. The 'vow' array is only used in the else part of the condition. We can move its declaration inside the else block to avoid unnecessary memory usage.
5. The 'imain' variable can be eliminated by calculating its value directly inside the nested loop.
6. Instead of using the 'cout' statement inside the nested loop, we can form a string and print it once after the loop. This reduces the number of function calls to the 'cout' object.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Remove the 'ans' function as it is not used.
2. Replace the vector 'v' with two integer variables 'r' and 'c' to store the last pair of factors.
3. Calculate the square root of 'n' once and store it in a variable 'sqrt_n'.
4. Move the declaration of the 'vow' array inside the else block.
5. Eliminate the 'imain' variable by calculating its value directly inside the nested loop.
6. Instead of using the 'cout' statement inside the nested loop, form a string 'output' and append characters to it. Print 'output' once after the loop.

Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  int n, d;
  cin >> n;
  if (n < 25)
    cout << -1 << endl;
  else {
    int r = 0, c = 0;
    int sqrt_n = sqrt(n);
    for (int i = 1; i <= sqrt_n; i++) {
      if (n % i == 0) {
        r = i;
        c = n / i;
      }
    }
    if (r >= 5 && c >= 5) {
      char vow[] = {'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'};
      string output;
      for (int i = 0; i < r; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < c; j++) {
          output += vow[(i + j) % 5];
        }
      }
      cout << output << endl;
    } else {
      cout << -1 << endl;
    }
  }
}
```

The optimized code retains the functionality and output of the original code while improving efficiency by:
1. Removing unused code.
2. Using simple variables instead of vectors.
3. Avoiding redundant calculations.
4. Minimizing memory usage.
5. Reducing the number of function calls.
