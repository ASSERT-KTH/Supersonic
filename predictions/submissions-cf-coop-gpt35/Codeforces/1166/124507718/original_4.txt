The given code appears to generate a matrix of characters based on the input number `n`, where `n` is expected to be at least 25. The matrix should have dimensions `r` and `c`, where `r` is the largest factor of `n` greater than or equal to 5, and `c` is the smallest factor of `n` greater than or equal to 5. The characters in the matrix are selected from the vowels 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', and 'u' in a repeating pattern.

Upon analyzing the code, I have identified a few potential areas for optimization:

1. Redundant calculations in the loop: The loop that generates the matrix of characters calculates `r` and `c` for each iteration, even though they will remain the same throughout the loop. This can be optimized by moving the calculation of `r` and `c` outside the loop.

2. Inefficient memory usage: The program uses a vector of vectors to store the factors of `n`. However, since we only need the largest and smallest factors, we can optimize memory usage by using two separate variables instead of a vector of vectors.

3. Unnecessary check inside the `ans` function: The `arr[0] == 1` check in the `ans` function is unnecessary because the loop starts from index 1. This check can be removed to improve efficiency.

Now, let's proceed with the optimization steps one by one.

Step 1: Move the calculation of `r` and `c` outside the loop
- Currently, the code calculates `r` and `c` for each iteration of the loop. Since the values of `r` and `c` remain the same throughout the loop, we can move the calculation outside the loop to avoid redundant computations.

Step 2: Replace the vector of vectors with separate variables for `r` and `c`
- Instead of storing the factors of `n` in a vector of vectors, we can optimize memory usage by using two separate variables to store the largest and smallest factors. This eliminates the need for creating and populating the vector of vectors.

Step 3: Remove the unnecessary check inside the `ans` function
- The `arr[0] == 1` check inside the `ans` function is unnecessary because the loop starts from index 1. We can remove this check to improve efficiency.

Now, let's implement these optimizations in the code.
