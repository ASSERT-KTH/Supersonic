Code Analysis:
- The `ans` function checks if there is a subsequence of length 3 in the given array `arr` such that the numbers are consecutive.
- The `main` function takes an input `n` and checks if `n` is greater than or equal to 25. If it is, it finds the factors of `n` and checks if the largest factor is greater than or equal to 5. If it is, it prints a pattern of vowels based on the factor values. If `n` is less than 25, it prints -1.

Potential Performance Bottlenecks:
1. The `ans` function has a loop that checks for consecutive numbers. This loop can be optimized.
2. The `main` function has a loop that finds the factors of `n`. This loop can also be optimized.
3. The `main` function uses a vector of vectors to store the factors of `n`. This data structure can be optimized.

Optimization Strategy:
1. In the `ans` function, instead of checking for consecutive numbers using a loop, we can use a sliding window approach to keep track of the count of consecutive numbers. This will eliminate the need for the loop and reduce the time complexity.
2. In the `main` function, we can optimize the loop that finds the factors of `n` by only iterating up to the square root of `n`. We can also eliminate the need for the vector of vectors by directly storing the largest factors in separate variables.
3. We can remove the unnecessary `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` and replace it with specific headers that are required.
4. We can remove the unnecessary `using namespace std;` and use the `std::` prefix for standard library functions and types.
5. We can remove the unused variable `d` in the `main` function.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. In the `ans` function, we will use a sliding window approach to check for consecutive numbers. We will keep track of the count of consecutive numbers using a variable `c`. If `c` reaches 3, we return true. This eliminates the need for the loop and reduces the time complexity.
2. In the `main` function, we will optimize the loop that finds the factors of `n` by only iterating up to the square root of `n`. We will also remove the vector of vectors and directly store the largest factors in separate variables `r` and `c`. This reduces the memory usage.
3. We will remove the unnecessary `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` and replace it with specific headers that are required.
4. We will remove the unnecessary `using namespace std;` and use the `std::` prefix for standard library functions and types.
5. We will remove the unused variable `d` in the `main` function.
