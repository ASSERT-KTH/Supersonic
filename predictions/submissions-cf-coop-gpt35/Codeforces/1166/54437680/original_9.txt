The given code is a C++ program that aims to find the count of pairs (i, j) in an array `arr` such that `2 * arr[i] < arr[j]`. The code uses a binary search to find the index `mid` (using the `findbestr` function) such that `arr[mid]` is the largest element in `arr` that is less than or equal to `2 * arr[i]`. The count of such pairs is accumulated in the variable `count`.

To optimize this code, we can focus on the following aspects:

1. Remove unnecessary header inclusions: The code includes `<bits/stdc++.h>`, which is not recommended as it includes a large number of standard library headers and can slow down compile times. We can replace it with the specific headers that are needed in the code.

2. Remove unnecessary preprocessor macros: The code defines several preprocessor macros that are not used. We can remove them to simplify the code.

3. Avoid unnecessary vector copies: The code creates a copy of the input array `arr` by iterating over it and storing the absolute values of the elements in a new vector. This copy is not necessary and can be avoided.

4. Simplify the binary search: The binary search in the `findbestr` function can be simplified by removing the unnecessary `if (l == r)` check. The loop condition `l <= r` is sufficient to terminate the loop correctly.

5. Avoid unnecessary sorting: The code sorts the array `arr` before performing the pair counting. Since we are only interested in the count of pairs, we don't need to sort the entire array. We can instead use a two-pointer approach to count the pairs directly.

6. Optimize the pair counting: The current implementation of pair counting has a time complexity of O(n^2) because it iterates over all pairs of indices (i, j) and checks the condition `2 * arr[i] < arr[j]`. We can optimize this by using a sliding window approach. By maintaining two pointers `l` and `r` that represent the left and right boundaries of the window, we can increment `count` by `i - l` when the condition is satisfied. We can then slide the window by incrementing `l` until the condition is no longer satisfied.

7. Avoid unnecessary memory zeroing: The code uses the `mst` macro to zero-initialize an array `A`. However, `A` is not used in the code. We can remove this macro.

Based on these observations, we can now proceed with optimizing the code.
