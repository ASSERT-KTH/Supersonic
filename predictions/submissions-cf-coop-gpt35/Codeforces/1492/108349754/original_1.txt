The given code seems to find the maximum length of a substring in string `s` that matches the pattern `t`. It does this by iterating through the characters of `t` and finding the corresponding positions in `s`. Then, it calculates the length of the substring between each pair of positions and keeps track of the maximum length.

Here are some potential optimizations that can be applied to this code:

1. Use `std::string::find` instead of manual character comparison: Instead of manually comparing characters in the while loop, we can use the `std::string::find` function to find the next occurrence of the character. This can potentially improve the efficiency of the inner loop.

2. Avoid redundant assignments: The code assigns `p1 = m - 1` and `p2 = n - 1` before the second while loop. However, these assignments are unnecessary as the variables are already set to these values at the end of the first while loop.

3. Optimize the loop condition: The loop `for (int i = 0; i < m - 1; ++i)` can be optimized to `for (int i = 0; i < m - 1; i++)` to avoid the unnecessary addition operation `i + 1` in each iteration.

4. Use `std::max_element` instead of manual iteration: Instead of manually iterating through the `pos` and `pos2` arrays to find the maximum length, we can use the `std::max_element` function to find the maximum element in each array.

Taking these optimizations into consideration, here's the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int n, m;
  string s, t;
  cin >> n >> m >> s >> t;

  int ans = 0;
  int p1 = 0, p2 = 0;
  while (p1 < m) {
    p2 = s.find(t[p1], p2);
    if (p2 == string::npos) break;
    pos[p1++] = p2++;
  }

  p1 = 0, p2 = n - 1;
  while (p1 < m) {
    p2 = s.rfind(t[p1], p2);
    if (p2 == string::npos) break;
    pos2[p1++] = p2--;
  }

  auto max_pos = max_element(pos, pos + m - 1);
  auto min_pos2 = min_element(pos2, pos2 + m - 1);

  ans = max(ans, *max_pos - *min_pos2);

  cout << ans;
  return 0;
}
```

These optimizations aim to reduce unnecessary operations and utilize standard library functions where possible to improve efficiency. The trade-off is that the code may become slightly more complex due to the use of additional functions and iterators. However, the benefits in terms of improved performance and reduced memory usage should outweigh this complexity.
