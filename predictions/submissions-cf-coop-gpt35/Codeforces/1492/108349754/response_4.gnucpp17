Upon analyzing the given code, I have identified a few areas that can be optimized for efficiency:

1. Inefficient string search: The code uses nested while loops to search for characters in the string `s` that match the characters in the string `t`. This approach has a time complexity of O(n*m), where n is the length of `s` and m is the length of `t`. This can be improved to O(n+m) using a different approach.

2. Inefficient memory usage: The code uses two arrays, `pos` and `pos2`, to store the positions of matching characters in `s` for each character in `t`. This requires additional memory and can be optimized to use a single array.

3. Redundant computations: The code iterates over the `pos` and `pos2` arrays to calculate the maximum difference between consecutive positions. This can be done during the search itself, eliminating the need for a separate loop.

To optimize the code, I propose the following steps:

Step 1: Replace the nested while loops with a single loop to search for characters in `s` that match the characters in `t`. Instead of iterating over each character in `s` and comparing it with each character in `t`, we can use a single loop to iterate over `s` and `t` simultaneously. This approach has a time complexity of O(n+m) and eliminates the need for nested loops.

Step 2: Combine the `pos` and `pos2` arrays into a single array `pos` by storing the positions of matching characters in `s` for each character in `t`. This reduces the memory usage from O(m) to O(1).

Step 3: Calculate the maximum difference between consecutive positions during the search itself. Instead of iterating over the `pos` and `pos2` arrays separately, we can calculate the difference between consecutive positions while updating the `pos` array.
