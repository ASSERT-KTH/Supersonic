After analyzing the provided code, here are some potential optimizations that can be made:

1. Avoid using the `bits/stdc++.h` header: This header includes the entire standard library, which can result in increased compilation time and unnecessary memory usage. It is better to include only the necessary headers, such as `<iostream>` and `<string>` in this case.

2. Use more efficient data structures: The current code uses two arrays, `pos` and `pos2`, to store positions. However, these arrays are not necessary and can be replaced with two variables. Since the size of the arrays is known in advance (`m`), it is more efficient to use `p1` and `p2` variables to keep track of the positions.

3. Avoid unnecessary computations: The current code has two nested loops for finding the positions of characters in the strings `s` and `t`. However, this can be simplified by tracking the positions while iterating through the strings just once. This will eliminate the need for nested loops and reduce the number of comparisons.

4. Optimize the loop: The loop that calculates the maximum difference between positions can be optimized by starting the loop from `i = 0` and ending at `i < m - 1`. This avoids an unnecessary iteration and also simplifies the loop condition.

With these optimizations in mind, here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int n, m;
  string s, t;
  cin >> n >> m >> s >> t;

  int p1 = 0, p2 = 0;
  int ans = 0;

  while (p1 < m) {
    while (p2 < n && s[p2] != t[p1]) {
      p2++;
    }
    ans = max(ans, p2 - p1);
    p1++;
    p2++;
  }

  cout << ans;

  return 0;
}
```

In this optimized code, unnecessary variables and arrays have been removed, and the loop has been simplified. The code now tracks the positions of characters in `s` and `t` while iterating through them, and calculates the maximum difference between positions on the fly. This approach reduces memory usage and improves performance.
