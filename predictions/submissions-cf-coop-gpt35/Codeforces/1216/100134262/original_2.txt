Code Analysis:
1. The code includes several unnecessary header files that are not being used. Removing these unused header files can improve compile time.
2. The `map` data structure is used to store prime factors in the `getfactor` function. However, a `vector` or an array would be more efficient for this purpose, as the prime factors are known to be within a fixed range.
3. The `power` function can be optimized by using exponentiation by squaring instead of repeated multiplication.
4. The `gcd` function can be further optimized by using the Euclidean algorithm iteratively instead of recursively.
5. The `inverse` function can be optimized by using Fermat's Little Theorem instead of the `power` function.
6. The `ncr` function can be optimized by using a memoization technique to avoid redundant computations.
7. The `push` function in the `upd` function can be optimized by reducing unnecessary function calls.
8. The `get` function in the `upd` function can be optimized by reducing unnecessary function calls.

4. Optimize the `gcd` function using the iterative version of the Euclidean algorithm.
5. Optimize the `inverse` function using Fermat's Little Theorem.
6. Optimize the `ncr` function using memoization.
7. Optimize the `push` function in the `upd` function to reduce unnecessary function calls.
8. Optimize the `get` function in the `upd` function to reduce unnecessary function calls.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Remove unnecessary header files:
   - Remove the unnecessary header files that are not being used, such as `<bitset>`, `<cassert>`, `<chrono>`, `<complex>`, `<deque>`, `<functional>`, `<iomanip>`, `<iterator>`, `<limits>`, `<numeric>`, `<queue>`, `<random>`, `<sstream>`, `<stack>`, `<tuple>`, `<unordered_map>`, `<unordered_set>`, `<valarray>`.
   - This will improve compile time by reducing unnecessary file includes.

2. Replace `map` with `vector` or array:
   - Replace the `map` data structure in the `getfactor` function with a more efficient data structure, such as a `vector` or an array.
   - Since the prime factors are known to be within a fixed range, a `vector` or an array can be used to store the prime factors and their counts.
   - This will reduce memory usage and improve performance by avoiding the overhead of the `map` data structure.

3. Optimize the `power` function using exponentiation by squaring:
   - Replace the current implementation of the `power` function with an optimized version using exponentiation by squaring.
   - This algorithm reduces the number of multiplications required to calculate the power of a number.
   - The new implementation of the `power` function will have a logarithmic time complexity instead of a linear time complexity.
   - This will significantly improve the performance of calculations involving large powers.

4. Optimize the `gcd` function using the iterative version of the Euclidean algorithm:
   - Replace the current recursive implementation of the `gcd` function with an iterative version using the Euclidean algorithm.
   - The iterative algorithm avoids the overhead of function calls and stack frames, resulting in improved performance.
   - This will optimize the calculation of the greatest common divisor between two numbers.

5. Optimize the `inverse` function using Fermat's Little Theorem:
   - Replace the current implementation of the `inverse` function with a more efficient implementation using Fermat's Little Theorem.
   - Fermat's Little Theorem states that for any prime number `p` and any integer `a` not divisible by `p`, `a^(p-1) ≡ 1 (mod p)`.
   - Therefore, `a^(p-2) ≡ a^(-1) (mod p)`.
   - This means that the modular inverse of `a` modulo `p` can be calculated by raising `a` to the power of `p-2` modulo `p`.
   - This will improve the performance of calculating the modular inverse.

6. Optimize the `ncr` function using memoization:
   - Add an array to store precalculated values of `fac[r]` and `inverse(fac[r], p)` for each value of `r`.
   - When calculating `ncr(n, r, p)`, check if the precalculated values are available in the array.
   - If the values are available, use them directly instead of recalculating.
   - This will avoid redundant computations and improve the performance of calculating binomial coefficients.

7. Optimize the `push` function in the `upd` function to reduce unnecessary function calls:
   - Remove the redundant call to `push` at the end of the function.
   - This will reduce the number of function calls and improve the performance of the `upd` function.

8. Optimize the `get` function in the `upd` function to reduce unnecessary function calls:
   - Remove the redundant call to `push` at the beginning of the function.
   - This will reduce the number of function calls and improve the performance of the `get` function.
