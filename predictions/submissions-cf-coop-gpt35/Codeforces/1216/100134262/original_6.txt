The given code appears to be a C++ program that solves a specific problem. It contains various libraries, macros, and functions to perform the required calculations. However, there are several areas where the code can be optimized for efficiency. Let's go through them step by step:

1. **Redundant Macros**: The code contains several macros that are not used in the program. Removing these macros will improve code readability and reduce the preprocessing time.

2. **Unused Libraries**: Some libraries are included in the code but not used. Removing these unused libraries will reduce the compilation time.

3. **Unnecessary Data Structures**: The `lazy` array and `push` function are used to implement lazy propagation in the `upd` function. However, the `push` function is called before every operation, even when lazy propagation is not required. This can be optimized by removing the lazy propagation mechanism and directly updating the `dp` array in the `upd` function.

4. **Loop Optimization**: The `solve` function contains a loop that iterates from 1 to `n`. However, the loop can be optimized by starting from `k + 2` instead of 1. This is because the first `k + 1` elements have already been processed in the initial loop iteration.

5. **Memory Optimization**: The `dp` and `lazy` arrays are unnecessarily initialized with a large value (`1e18`) in the `solve` function. Since the `get` function only queries the minimum value from these arrays, initializing them with a smaller value would suffice.

6. **Compiler Optimizations**: The code includes several `#pragma` directives to optimize the code using specific compiler flags. These pragmas can be helpful in improving the performance, especially when targeting specific hardware architectures.

Based on these observations, let's optimize the code step by step:
