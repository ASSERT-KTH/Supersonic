Code Analysis:
- The code includes several unnecessary header files that are not used in the provided code. Removing these unnecessary includes can improve compilation time.
- The `sieve` function computes the smallest prime factor for each number up to `MAXN`, which is later used in the `getfactor` function. However, only prime factors of numbers up to `n` are required for the problem. Therefore, the `sieve` function can be modified to compute prime factors up to `n` instead of `MAXN`.
- The `getfactor` function uses a map to store prime factors and their counts. However, a more efficient data structure for this purpose would be a vector of pairs, where each pair represents a prime factor and its count. This can reduce memory usage and improve performance.
- The `power` function uses an iterative method to compute the power of a number. However, a more efficient approach is to use the exponentiation by squaring algorithm, which reduces the number of multiplications required.
- The `gcd` function uses the Euclidean algorithm to compute the greatest common divisor of two numbers. This function can be replaced with the built-in `__gcd` function from the `<algorithm>` header, which is more efficient.
- The `inverse` function computes the modular inverse of a number using the `power` function. However, a more efficient approach is to use Fermat's little theorem and compute the modular inverse using modular exponentiation.
- The `ncr` function computes the binomial coefficient `n choose r`. This function can be optimized by using the property `C(n, r) = C(n, n - r)` and computing the smaller of the two values.
- The `push` function is used to update the lazy propagation values in the segment tree. However, it is not necessary to update the lazy values before every push operation. Instead, the lazy values can be updated only when necessary, which can reduce the number of updates and improve performance.
- The `upd` function updates the segment tree with the minimum value in a range. However, the lazy propagation values are updated before every recursive call, which is unnecessary. The lazy values can be updated only when necessary, similar to the `push` function.
- The `get` function retrieves the minimum value in a range from the segment tree. Similar to the `upd` function, the lazy propagation values can be updated only when necessary.

     - <bitset>
     - <chrono>
     - <complex>
     - <deque>
     - <functional>
     - <iomanip>
     - <iterator>
     - <limits>
     - <map>
     - <numeric>

2. Modify the `sieve` function:
   - Currently, the `sieve` function computes the smallest prime factor for each number up to `MAXN`, which is not necessary for the problem.
   - Instead, modify the `sieve` function to compute the smallest prime factor for each number up to `n`.
   - This can be done by changing the loop condition from `i < MAXN` to `i <= n` and the loop condition in the inner loop from `j < MAXN` to `j <= n`.
   - This optimization reduces unnecessary computations and memory usage.

3. Replace the map data structure in the `getfactor` function:
   - Currently, the `getfactor` function uses a map to store prime factors and their counts.

   - Replace the map data structure with a vector of pairs to reduce memory usage and improve performance.
   - The modified `getfactor` function will return a vector of pairs instead of a map.

4. Replace the iterative power function with exponentiation by squaring:
   - The `power` function currently uses an iterative method to compute the power of a number.

   - The `gcd` function currently uses the Euclidean algorithm to compute the greatest common divisor of two numbers.

   - Replace the `gcd` function with the `__gcd` function to improve performance.

6. Modify the `inverse` function to use Fermat's little theorem:
   - The `inverse` function currently computes the modular inverse of a number using the `power` function.
