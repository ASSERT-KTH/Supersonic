Code Analysis:
- The code begins with several pragma directives that are used to optimize the code during compilation. These directives provide hints to the compiler to optimize the code for performance.
- The code includes several standard C++ libraries that are used for various operations.
- The code defines macros for convenience, such as shortening certain function names or defining constants.
- The code implements functions for prime factorization, power calculation, greatest common divisor calculation, inverse calculation, and combination calculation.
- The code also includes a segment tree implementation for range queries and updates.
- The main function reads input, calls the solve function, and outputs the result.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Remove unnecessary libraries: The code includes several C++ libraries, but not all of them are used. Remove the unused libraries to reduce compilation time and memory usage.
2. Avoid unnecessary calculations: Analyze the code to identify any unnecessary calculations or computations that can be eliminated to improve performance.
3. Optimize prime factorization: The current prime factorization implementation uses a map to store the factors. Instead, consider using a vector or array to store the factors, as it would be more memory-efficient and faster for lookup.
4. Simplify power calculation: The power calculation function can be simplified by using the iterative method instead of the recursive method. This would eliminate the need for recursion and improve performance.
5. Optimize gcd calculation: The current gcd calculation uses the Euclidean algorithm recursively. Consider using the iterative version of the algorithm for better performance.
6. Optimize combination calculation: The current combination calculation uses the factorial and inverse functions. Consider using a more efficient algorithm, such as Pascal's triangle or precalculated values, to calculate combinations.
7. Optimize segment tree implementation: Analyze the segment tree implementation to identify any potential optimizations, such as reducing memory usage or improving query/update operations.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Remove unnecessary libraries: Remove the unused libraries to reduce compilation time and memory usage. In this code, the following libraries are not used and can be removed:
   - `<algorithm>`
   - `<bitset>`
   - `<cassert>`
   - `<chrono>`
   - `<cmath>`
   - `<complex>`
   - `<cstdio>`
   - `<cstdlib>`
   - `<ctime>`
   - `<deque>`
   - `<functional>`
   - `<iomanip>`
   - `<iostream>`
   - `<iterator>`
   - `<limits>`
   - `<numeric>`
   - `<queue>`
   - `<random>`
   - `<sstream>`
   - `<stack>`
   - `<tuple>`
   - `<unordered_map>`
   - `<unordered_set>`
   - `<valarray>`
   - `<vector>`
   
   The updated code will only include the necessary libraries: `<map>` and `<string>`.
   
2. Avoid unnecessary calculations: Review the code to identify any unnecessary calculations or computations that can be eliminated to improve performance. In this code, there are no obvious unnecessary calculations.

3. Optimize prime factorization: The current prime factorization implementation uses a map to store the factors. Instead, consider using a vector or array to store the factors, as it would be more memory-efficient and faster for lookup. The updated `getfactor` function will use a vector to store the factors.

4. Simplify power calculation: The power calculation function can be simplified by using the iterative method instead of the recursive method. This would eliminate the need for recursion and improve performance. The updated `power` function will use an iterative approach to calculate the power.

5. Optimize gcd calculation: The current gcd calculation uses the Euclidean algorithm recursively. Consider using the iterative version of the algorithm for better performance. The updated `gcd` function will use an iterative approach to calculate the gcd.

6. Optimize combination calculation: The current combination calculation uses the factorial and inverse functions. Consider using a more efficient algorithm, such as Pascal's triangle or precalculated values, to calculate combinations. The updated `ncr` function will use Pascal's triangle to calculate combinations.

7. Optimize segment tree implementation: Analyze the segment tree implementation to identify any potential optimizations, such as reducing memory usage or improving query/update operations. In this code, there are no obvious optimizations to be made.
