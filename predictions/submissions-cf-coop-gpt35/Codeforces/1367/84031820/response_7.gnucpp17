Upon analyzing the given code, I have identified several potential optimizations that can be made to improve its performance:

1. Unnecessary Includes: The code includes the entire `bits/stdc++.h` library, which is not recommended as it includes a large number of header files. Instead, we can include only the necessary header files, such as `<iostream>` and `<vector>`, to reduce compilation time.

2. Redundant Macro Definitions: The `ceil` macro is defined, but it is not used anywhere in the code. We can safely remove this macro.

3. Unnecessary `std` Namespace Usage: The code unnecessarily uses the `std` namespace throughout the entire code. We can remove this line and prefix the relevant standard library classes and functions with `std::` to improve code readability.

4. Unnecessary `sync_with_stdio` and `cin.tie` calls: The `ios::sync_with_stdio(false)` and `cin.tie(NULL)` calls are not necessary in this code as there are no interactions between C and C++ streams. We can safely remove these calls.

5. Unnecessary Use of `max` and `min` Functions: The code uses the `max` and `min` functions to prevent accessing indices out of bounds. However, we can optimize this by using simple if conditions to check the boundaries before accessing array elements.

6. Inefficient Memory Usage: The code uses a `vector<int>` to store the prefix sums. However, we can optimize memory usage by using a simple array instead of a vector.

7. Redundant Loop: The outer loop iterates `t` times, but the `ans` variable is overwritten in each iteration. We can optimize this by calculating the value directly inside the loop without using the `ans` variable.

8. Unnecessary if Condition Inside Loop: The inner loop checks for `cnt > 0` in each iteration, which is redundant because `cnt` is always greater than 0. We can remove this condition to improve efficiency.

9. Inefficient Loop Iteration: The outer loop iterates from 0 to `n-1`, but the inner loop can modify the value of `i` inside the loop. To avoid any inconsistencies, we can change the inner loop to a `while` loop and use a separate variable for iterating.
