The given code is a C++ program that reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `k`, and a string `s` of length `n`. The program then calculates and outputs the number of changes required to make all the characters in the string `s` equal, while minimizing the cost of changing a character to its adjacent characters (within a range of `k` positions on either side).

Upon analyzing the code, the following potential optimizations and areas for improvement can be identified:

1. Remove unnecessary header inclusion: The program includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header, which is not a standard C++ header file. It is recommended to include only the necessary standard library headers explicitly, rather than relying on non-standard headers.

2. Avoid unnecessary type definitions: The code includes type definitions for `ll` and `ld`, which are not used in the program. Removing these unnecessary type definitions will simplify the code.

3. Eliminate unnecessary macros: The `ceil` macro is not used in the code and can be removed. The `all` and `rall` macros can be replaced with their respective `begin` and `end` functions, which are more readable and do not rely on macros.

4. Optimize the prefix sum calculation: The code uses a prefix sum technique to calculate the changes required at each position. However, the current implementation updates the prefix sum array for every character in the string, resulting in redundant calculations. A more efficient approach would be to update the prefix sum only for the relevant positions, i.e., `max(0, i - k)` and `min(n, i + k + 1)`.

5. Optimize the loop to count the number of changes: The current implementation uses a loop to iterate over each position in the string and count the number of changes required. This loop can be optimized by considering only the positions where the prefix sum is zero, as these are the positions where changes are required.

6. Improve variable naming and code readability: Some of the variable names used in the code are not descriptive enough. Renaming them to more meaningful names will improve the readability of the code.

Based on these observations, the following step-by-step optimization strategy can be formulated:

1. Remove the unnecessary header inclusion.
2. Remove the unnecessary type definitions.
3. Remove the unnecessary macros.
4. Optimize the prefix sum calculation by updating it only for the relevant positions.
5. Optimize the loop to count the number of changes by considering only the positions where the prefix sum is zero.
6. Improve variable naming and code readability.
