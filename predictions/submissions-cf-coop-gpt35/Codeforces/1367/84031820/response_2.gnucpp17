The provided code calculates the number of times the characters '0' and '1' appear in a given string `s` within a window of size `k`. The algorithm uses a prefix sum array `pref` to keep track of the number of occurrences of '1' within each window. The final result is the number of windows where no '1' is present.

Upon analyzing the code, I have identified a few potential areas for optimization:

1. The use of the `bits/stdc++.h` header: This header includes the entire Standard Template Library (STL), which can slow down the compilation process and increase memory usage. It is recommended to include only the necessary headers, such as `<iostream>`, `<vector>`, and `<string>`, to reduce unnecessary overhead.

2. The use of the `ceil` macro: The `ceil` macro calculates the ceiling of the division between `n` and `m`. However, this can be simplified by using the `/` operator directly and adding 1 if `n` is not divisible by `m`. This change can improve code readability and potentially reduce the number of function calls.

3. The use of `vector<int>` for the prefix sum array: Although the use of a vector is convenient, it might be more efficient to use a simple array instead. Vectors come with additional overhead, such as dynamic memory allocation and bounds checking, which can impact performance. Switching to a regular array can reduce memory usage and improve cache efficiency.

4. The unnecessary use of `max(0, i - k)` and `min(n, i + k + 1)`: These expressions are used to ensure that the indices do not go out of bounds. However, this check is unnecessary since the prefix sum array `pref` has a size of `n + 1`. Therefore, the indices will always be within bounds, and the checks can be removed.

5. The redundant loop to calculate the prefix sum array: The current implementation iterates over the string `s` and updates the prefix sum array `pref` accordingly. However, this can be done in a single loop by using a sliding window approach. This optimization can reduce the number of iterations and improve performance.

6. The nested loop to count the number of windows with no '1': The current implementation uses a nested loop to iterate over the prefix sum array `pref` and count the number of windows with zero occurrences of '1'. However, this can be done more efficiently by using a single loop and updating the count directly. This optimization can reduce the number of iterations and improve performance.

Based on these observations, the following optimization strategy can be formulated:

1. Replace the `bits/stdc++.h` header with the necessary headers (`<iostream>`, `<vector>`, `<string>`).
2. Replace the `ceil` macro with a simple division and addition.
3. Replace the `vector<int>` declaration with a regular array.
4. Remove the unnecessary index checks when updating the prefix sum array.
5. Optimize the calculation of the prefix sum array using a sliding window approach.
6. Optimize the counting of windows with no '1' using a single loop.
