The provided code is a C++ program that solves a specific problem. It includes various #define statements for preprocessor directives, along with some utility functions and data structures. The main function reads input, calls the __sol() function to solve the problem, and measures the execution time. Let's analyze the code and identify potential areas for optimization:

1. Preprocessor Directives:
   - The #define statements are used to define constants and macros. These can make the code more readable and maintainable, but they do not directly impact performance.
   - However, the use of macros like "forr" and "fastio" can sometimes result in less efficient code. We will analyze these macros further in the optimization strategy.

2. Utility Functions:
   - The code includes various utility functions for printing, power calculation, gcd, lcm, etc. These functions are not directly related to the performance of the main program logic and can be considered as separate entities.

3. Main Function:
   - The main function includes a loop that reads the number of test cases, calls the __sol() function for each test case, and measures the execution time.
   - Inside the __sol() function, there is a loop that performs calculations based on the input.
   - The __sol() function is the core of the program and is where we should focus our optimization efforts.

Based on this analysis, we will now formulate our optimization strategy.
