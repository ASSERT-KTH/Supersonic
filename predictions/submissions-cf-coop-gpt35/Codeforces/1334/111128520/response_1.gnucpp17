The given code is a C++ program that solves a specific problem. However, the code contains several areas that can be optimized for efficiency. Let's analyze the code and identify potential optimization opportunities.

1. Redundant includes: The code includes the entire `<bits/stdc++.h>` header file, which is not recommended as it includes many unnecessary headers. It's better to include only the specific headers that are needed.

2. Unnecessary macros: The code defines several macros that are not used. Removing these macros will make the code cleaner and easier to read.

3. Unnecessary debug functions: The code defines several debug functions that are not used. These functions are meant for debugging purposes and can be safely removed.

4. Redundant power functions: The code defines two power functions, `power(long long x, long long n, const long long P)` and `power(long long int x, long long int n)`. However, only the first power function is used in the code. We can remove the second power function to eliminate redundancy.

5. Inefficient loop: The code uses a `for` loop to iterate over the input vector `v` to calculate `cnt`. However, we can optimize this loop to avoid unnecessary calculations.

6. Inefficient calculation of `cnt`: The code calculates `cnt` by summing `curr` for each element in `v`. This can be optimized by using a cumulative sum approach.

7. Inefficient calculation of `ans`: The code calculates `ans` by iterating over the elements in `v` and performing several calculations. This can be optimized to reduce the number of calculations.
