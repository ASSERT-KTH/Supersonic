The given code is a C++ program that solves a specific problem. However, the code has several areas that can be optimized to improve performance and minimize memory usage. Let's analyze each section of the code and propose optimization strategies for them.

1. Preprocessor Directives:
   - The `bits/stdc++.h` header includes a large number of standard library headers, which can increase compilation time. It is better to include only the necessary individual headers.
   - The `#define` statements for commonly used constants and macros can improve code readability, but they can also cause code bloat if used excessively. It is recommended to limit the usage of such macros and constants to essential areas of the code.

2. Input/Output:
   - The `fastio` function is used to improve I/O performance by disabling synchronization with C I/O functions. However, it is not necessary to use this function if the performance gain is negligible.
   - The `cout` and `cin` objects are used for I/O operations. While they are convenient to use, they can be slower compared to the C-style `printf` and `scanf` functions. Consider using these functions for better performance.

3. Data Structures and Algorithms:
   - The code uses a vector of pairs to store a list of values. While vectors provide dynamic resizing, they can have a performance impact due to reallocation and copying of elements. Consider using a fixed-size array or a custom data structure if the number of elements is known in advance and does not change.
   - The `power` function is implemented using a loop to calculate the power of a number. This can be optimized using exponentiation by squaring, which reduces the number of multiplications required.

4. Loop Optimization:
   - The code contains multiple loops that iterate over the vector elements. These loops can be optimized by:
     - Using iterators instead of indexing to access vector elements, as iterator-based access is generally faster.
     - Caching frequently used values outside the loop to avoid unnecessary calculations.
     - Unrolling loops to reduce loop overhead and improve instruction-level parallelism.
   - The code also includes a loop that calculates the sum of the elements in a vector. This can be optimized by using the `accumulate` function from the `<numeric>` header.

5. Compiler Optimizations:
   - Enabling compiler optimizations can significantly improve code performance. Consider using compiler flags such as `-O2` or `-O3` to enable optimization levels.

Based on the analysis above, let's proceed with the step-by-step optimization of the code.
