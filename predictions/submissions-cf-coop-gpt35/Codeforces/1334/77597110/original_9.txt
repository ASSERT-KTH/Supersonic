The given code appears to be a program that reads an integer `t` as input, followed by `t` test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `nn` and `m`, followed by an array of `nn` elements. It then sorts the array in descending order, calculates the average of the prefix subarrays, and counts the number of averages that are greater than or equal to `m`. Finally, it prints the count.

To optimize this code, we can focus on the following areas:

1. I/O Optimization: The code uses `cin` and `cout` for input and output respectively, which can be slower compared to other I/O methods like `scanf` and `printf`. By replacing `cin` with `scanf` and `cout` with `printf`, we can improve the input/output speed.

2. Unnecessary Macro Definitions: The code contains unnecessary macro definitions like `ll`, `ld`, `E`, `ull`, `TeFa`, and `Mod`. These macros are not used in the code and should be removed.

3. Avoiding the use of `bits/stdc++.h`: The code includes the entire `bits/stdc++.h` library, which is not recommended due to its large size and potential for conflicts. Instead, we should include only the necessary standard libraries.

4. Avoiding the use of `using namespace std;`: The code uses the `using namespace std;` directive, which can lead to naming conflicts and make the code harder to read and understand. It is better to use the `std::` prefix for standard library functions and types.

5. Avoiding Unnecessary Data Structures: The code uses a `vector<ll>` to store the input array, but it is not necessary to store the entire array. We can directly calculate the average and check if it is greater than or equal to `m` without storing the elements in a vector.

6. Loop Optimization: The code uses a loop to calculate the prefix averages. We can optimize this loop by avoiding unnecessary assignments and calculations.

7. Compiler Optimizations: We can use compiler optimizations to improve the performance of the code. For example, we can enable compiler optimizations using `-O2` flag or specific pragma directives.

Based on these observations, let's proceed with the optimization steps.
