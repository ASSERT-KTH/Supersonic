The provided code has several areas that can be optimized to improve performance and reduce memory usage:

1. Unnecessary Header Inclusions: The code includes unnecessary headers such as `<bits/stdc++.h>` and `<limits>`. These headers should be removed to reduce compilation time and unnecessary dependencies.

2. Redundant Preprocessor Definitions: The code defines several preprocessor macros (`ll`, `ld`, `E`, `ull`, `TeFa`, `in`, `Mod`, `IOT`). These macros are not used in the code and can be removed.

3. Use of `std::vector` and `std::sort`: The code uses `std::vector` to store the elements and then sorts them using `std::sort`. This introduces unnecessary memory allocation and sorting overhead. Instead, we can directly use an array and perform a custom sorting algorithm to optimize memory usage and improve sorting efficiency.

4. Unnecessary Division: The code computes the average by dividing the cumulative sum by the number of elements processed so far. However, this division operation can be avoided by multiplying the cumulative sum by the inverse of the number of elements.

5. Loop Optimization: The code uses a traditional for loop to iterate over the elements of the vector. This loop can be optimized by using a range-based for loop, which eliminates the need for an index variable and simplifies the code.

6. Avoid Floating-Point Arithmetic: The code uses `long double` for the `arr` array, which introduces unnecessary floating-point arithmetic operations. We can use `double` instead, which provides sufficient precision for the calculations.

Based on these observations, the following optimization strategy can be formulated:

1. Remove unnecessary header inclusions and preprocessor definitions.
2. Replace `std::vector` with a fixed-size array and implement a custom sorting algorithm.
3. Avoid unnecessary division and floating-point arithmetic.
4. Optimize the loop by using a range-based for loop.

Now, I will provide an optimized version of the code based on the proposed strategy.
