Analysis:

1. The code includes unnecessary header files `<bits/stdc++.h>` and `<limits>`. These should be removed as they are not used in the code.

2. The use of `#define` statements for commonly used constants (`ll`, `ld`, `E`, `ull`, `TeFa`, `in`, `Mod`, `IOT`) is confusing and obfuscates the code. It is better to define these constants explicitly or use them directly in the code.

3. The code uses `vector<ll> v` to store the input values and then sorts them in descending order using `sort(v.rbegin(), v.rend())`. This sorting operation has a time complexity of O(n log n), which can be avoided.

4. The code calculates the average of the first i+1 elements of the sorted array `v` and stores it in `arr[i]`. This can be optimized by calculating the average incrementally without the need for an additional array.

5. The code checks if `arr[i] >= m` for each element `arr[i]` and increments `cnt` if the condition is true. This can be optimized by maintaining a running count of the elements that satisfy the condition.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Remove unnecessary header files and `#define` statements.

2. Avoid sorting the input array `v`. Instead, calculate the running sum `sm` and the count `cnt` of elements greater than or equal to `m` in a single pass.

3. Calculate the average incrementally by updating the running sum and count.

4. Update the code to use explicit data types (`long long`, `long double`) instead of defining them using `#define`.

5. Provide meaningful variable names and remove unused variables.

Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. Remove unnecessary header files and `#define` statements. Replace `#define ll long long` with `typedef long long ll` for better readability.

2. Replace `in` with `cin` and remove the `IOT` macro. This will improve code readability.

3. Remove the sorting operation on the input array `v`. Instead, iterate over the elements of `v` and calculate the running sum `sm` and count `cnt` of elements greater than or equal to `m`.

4. Calculate the average incrementally by updating the running sum and count. The average can be calculated as `avg = sm / (i + 1)`.

5. Update the code to use explicit data types (`long long`, `long double`) instead of defining them using `#define`. This will improve code readability.

Optimized Code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

typedef long long ll;

int main() {
  std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  std::cin.tie(nullptr);

  ll t;
  std::cin >> t;

  while (t--) {
    ll nn, m;
    std::cin >> nn >> m;

    std::vector<ll> v(nn);
    ll sm = 0;
    ll cnt = 0;

    for (ll i = 0; i < nn; i++) {
      std::cin >> v[i];
      sm += v[i];
      if (sm / (i + 1) >= m)
        cnt++;
    }

    std::cout << cnt << std::endl;
  }

  return 0;
}
```

This optimized code removes unnecessary header files and `#define` statements. It calculates the sum `sm` and count `cnt` incrementally without sorting the input array. The average is calculated on the fly without the need for an additional array. The code is also updated to use explicit data types for better readability.
