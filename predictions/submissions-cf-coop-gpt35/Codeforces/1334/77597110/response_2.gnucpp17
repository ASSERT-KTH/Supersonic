The given code calculates the number of subarrays whose average is greater than or equal to a given threshold value. However, the code contains several inefficiencies that can be optimized to improve performance and reduce memory usage.

1. Remove unnecessary header files: The code includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header file, which is not standard and includes a large number of other header files. This can lead to increased compilation time and unnecessary memory usage. Instead, include only the necessary header files such as `<iostream>` and `<vector>`.

2. Avoid using the `using namespace std` directive: While convenient, the `using namespace std` directive can lead to namespace collisions and potential inefficiencies. It is better to use the `std::` prefix for standard library components.

3. Avoid unnecessary macro definitions: The code includes several unnecessary macro definitions such as `ll`, `ld`, `E`, `ull`, `TeFa`, `in`, and `Mod`. These macros make the code harder to read and understand. It is recommended to remove these macros and use explicit type declarations and standard library functions.

4. Use `std::vector` instead of `std::array`: The code uses a fixed-size array `arr` to store the average values. Instead, it is more efficient to use a dynamic container like `std::vector` to avoid wasting memory when the number of elements is unknown in advance.

5. Avoid unnecessary calculations: The code calculates the sum of all elements in the vector `v` for each iteration of the outer loop. This can be optimized by calculating the sum incrementally as elements are added to `arr`, eliminating the need for separate sum calculations.

6. Use `std::accumulate` for sum calculation: The code uses a loop to calculate the sum of elements in the vector `v`. It is more efficient to use the `std::accumulate` algorithm from the `<numeric>` header to perform the sum calculation in a single function call.

7. Use `std::count_if` for counting elements: The code uses a loop to count the number of elements in `arr` that are greater than or equal to `m`. It is more efficient to use the `std::count_if` algorithm from the `<algorithm>` header to perform the count in a single function call.

8. Avoid unnecessary type conversions: The code uses a mix of `long double` and `ll` types for calculations. It is more efficient to stick to a single data type, preferably a floating-point type such as `double`, for consistency and to avoid unnecessary type conversions.
