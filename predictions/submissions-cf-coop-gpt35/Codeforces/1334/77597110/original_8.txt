The provided code has several areas that can be optimized for efficiency:

1. Unnecessary includes: The code includes both `<bits/stdc++.h>` and `<limits>` headers, which are not required for this specific code. We can remove these includes.

2. Redundant macros: The code defines several macros (`ll`, `ld`, `E`, `ull`, `TeFa`, `in`, `Mod`, `IOT`) that are not used in the code. We can remove these macros.

3. Inefficient data structure: The code uses a vector to store the input elements. However, sorting the vector at each iteration can be inefficient for large inputs. We can use a priority queue instead, which will automatically sort the elements in descending order.

4. Redundant calculations: The code calculates the sum of the vector elements at each iteration, which is unnecessary. We can calculate the sum only once and update it incrementally as we iterate through the vector.

5. Unnecessary array initialization: The code initializes the `arr` array with zeros before assigning values to it. This is unnecessary as the array will be fully populated in the loop.

6. Improved loop iteration: The loop that calculates the average values can be optimized by using a pre-initialized variable to store the sum of the elements. This avoids calculating the sum in every iteration.

7. Compiler optimization hints: We can use compiler optimization flags or pragma directives to hint the compiler to optimize the code further.

With these optimizations in mind, let's proceed with the step-by-step explanation and the optimized code.
