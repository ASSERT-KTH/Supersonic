The provided code can be optimized in several ways to improve its performance and reduce memory usage. Let's go through each optimization step:

1. Remove unnecessary header files: The code includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header file, which is not needed. Instead, include the specific headers required for your program, such as `<iostream>`, `<vector>`, and `<algorithm>`.

2. Avoid using macros: The code includes macros for various purposes (`#define ll`, `#define ld`, etc.). Macros can make the code harder to read and understand. It's better to use proper C++ types and constants directly.

3. Use `std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false)` instead of `IOT`: The `IOT` macro is used to synchronize the C++ I/O streams with C I/O functions. However, it is better to use `std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false)` at the beginning of the `main` function to improve I/O performance.

4. Avoid using `using namespace std;`: While it is convenient to avoid typing `std::` before standard library objects, it can lead to namespace clashes and make the code less maintainable. Instead, use the `std::` prefix when necessary.

5. Use `std::vector` instead of `std::array` for dynamic size: The code uses a C-style array `arr[nn]` to store calculated values. It is better to use a `std::vector` to avoid potential buffer overflows and simplify memory management.

6. Avoid unnecessary calculations: The code calculates the sum of all elements in the vector `v` using `sm += v[i]` in each iteration of the loop. Instead, calculate the sum once before the loop and reuse it.

7. Use a single loop for calculation and counting: The code currently uses two separate loops: one for calculating the average and storing it in `arr`, and another loop for counting the number of averages greater than or equal to `m`. You can combine these operations into a single loop to avoid unnecessary iterations.

8. Use `reserve` to optimize vector capacity: Since the size of the vector `v` is known in advance (from `nn`), you can use `v.reserve(nn)` before the loop to preallocate memory for the vector. This avoids the overhead of dynamic memory reallocation and improves performance.

9. Avoid using `std::endl`: The code uses `std::endl` to end each line of output. However, `std::endl` not only inserts a newline character but also flushes the output buffer. Flushing the buffer can be expensive, so it is better to use `"\n"` instead to only insert a newline character.

Here is the optimized code with the above mentioned changes:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

int main() {
  std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  std::cin.tie(nullptr);

  int t;
  std::cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    int nn, m;
    std::cin >> nn >> m;

    std::vector<int> v;
    v.reserve(nn);

    int sm = 0;
    int cnt = 0;

    for (int i = 0; i < nn; i++) {
      int n;
      std::cin >> n;
      v.push_back(n);
      sm += n;
      if (static_cast<double>(sm) / (i + 1) >= m)
        cnt++;
    }

    std::cout << cnt << '\n';
  }

  return 0;
}
```

By applying these optimizations, we have improved the code's readability, reduced unnecessary calculations, and avoided potential memory issues. The code now uses standard C++ features and best practices to maximize performance and minimize memory usage.
