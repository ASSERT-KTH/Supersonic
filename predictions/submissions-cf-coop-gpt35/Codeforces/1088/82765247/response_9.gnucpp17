The provided code seems to be an implementation of a problem that involves manipulating a vector of integers. Some potential areas for optimization in this code include:

1. The use of unnecessary headers: The code includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header, which is not recommended as it includes a large number of unnecessary headers. It is better to include only the necessary headers.

2. The use of `using namespace std;`: This statement brings all the names from the `std` namespace into the current scope, which can lead to naming conflicts. It is better to use the `std::` prefix when using names from the `std` namespace.

3. The use of unnecessary type definitions: The code defines `lli`, `ulli`, and `ld` as type aliases, but they are not used in the code. These type definitions can be removed.

4. The use of macros: Macros can make the code harder to read and understand. It is better to avoid macros whenever possible.

5. The use of `vector<lli>`: The code uses a vector of `lli` to store the input values. However, the code only needs to access the values sequentially and does not require random access. Using a linked list instead of a vector can reduce the memory usage.

6. The use of a vector of pairs: The code uses a vector of pairs to store the operations performed on the vector. This can be simplified by using a single vector to store the operations in a compact format.

7. The use of unnecessary calculations: The code performs unnecessary calculations in the inner loops. Some of these calculations can be simplified or eliminated.

8. The use of unnecessary variables: The code uses variables that are not necessary for the logic of the program. These variables can be removed to reduce memory usage.

Based on these observations, the following optimization strategy can be applied:

1. Remove unnecessary headers and type definitions.
2. Replace the use of macros with regular function calls.
3. Replace the vector of `lli` with a linked list.
4. Replace the vector of pairs with a single vector.
5. Simplify the calculations in the inner loops.
6. Remove unnecessary variables.
