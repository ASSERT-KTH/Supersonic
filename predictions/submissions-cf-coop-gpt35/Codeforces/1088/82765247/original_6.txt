The given code appears to be solving a specific problem, but without any context or problem statement, it is difficult to determine the exact purpose. Nonetheless, we can still analyze and optimize the code for efficiency. 

Here are a few potential optimizations that can be made:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The code includes the entire `<bits/stdc++.h>` library, which is not recommended. Instead, include only the necessary libraries that are actually used in the code. This can help reduce compilation time and improve efficiency.

2. Minimize the use of macros: Macros such as `nl`, `er`, `fast`, `test`, `f0`, `f1`, `pb`, `mp`, `fi`, `se`, `print`, `out`, `Y`, and `N` are used extensively in the code. While macros can be convenient, they can also make the code harder to read and debug, and can potentially introduce subtle bugs. It is recommended to replace these macros with regular functions or inline functions where appropriate.

3. Avoid unnecessary vector resize: The code initializes a vector `v` with size `n+1` and later sets `v[0] = -1`. However, it seems that `v[0]` is never used. We can remove the resize and the assignment to improve efficiency.

4. Optimize loop iterations: The code uses a loop to read inputs into the `v` vector. Instead of using a loop, we can use the `std::copy` function to directly copy the inputs from `std::cin` to the `v` vector. This can potentially improve performance by reducing the number of loop iterations.

5. Replace vector with array: The code uses a vector to store the values of `v`. However, since the size of the vector is known at compile time (`n+1`), we can replace the vector with an array. This can improve efficiency by reducing memory overhead and improving cache locality.

6. Use prefix increment instead of postfix increment: The code uses postfix increment (`i++`) in the loops. However, prefix increment (`++i`) is generally more efficient as it avoids the overhead of creating a temporary copy of the object being incremented. We can replace all instances of `i++` with `++i` in the loops.

7. Avoid unnecessary calculations: The code performs unnecessary calculations in the inner loop. For example, in the `else` branch, the calculation `v[j] = v[j] + i - v[i]` is performed in every iteration, even though the value of `i - v[i]` remains constant throughout the loop. We can move this calculation outside the loop to avoid redundant calculations.

8. Optimize memory allocation for `pp` vector: The code uses a vector of pairs (`pp`) to store the results. However, since the size of `pp` is known in advance (equal to `n`), we can reserve the required memory for `pp` before the loop. This can reduce the number of memory allocations and improve efficiency.

9. Avoid unnecessary function calls: The code uses the `size()` function to retrieve the size of the `pp` vector in the loop. Since the size of `pp` does not change within the loop, we can store the size in a variable before the loop to avoid the function call in each iteration.

10. Avoid unnecessary pairs in `pp` vector: The code uses a vector of pairs (`pp`) to store the results, where each pair consists of an integer and another pair of integers. Instead of using nested pairs, we can use a struct or a tuple to store the results. This can simplify the code and potentially improve efficiency by reducing memory overhead.

With these optimizations in mind, I will now provide an optimized version of the code.
