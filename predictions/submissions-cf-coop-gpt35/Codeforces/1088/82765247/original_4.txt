The given code appears to solve a problem that involves manipulating an array of integers. The code reads an integer `n`, followed by `n` integers into a vector `v`. It then performs a series of operations on the vector `v`, generating a set of pairs and printing them.

Upon analyzing the code, the following potential optimizations can be identified:

1. The unnecessary use of `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`: This header includes the entire standard library and is generally considered bad practice. It can be replaced with specific headers that are actually required in the code.

2. Inefficient memory usage and unnecessary vector resize: The vector `v` is initialized with size `n+1` and then resized during the loop to accommodate the input elements. It would be more efficient to initialize the vector with the correct size from the beginning.

3. Inefficient loop structure: The loop structure used in the code is not optimal. It starts from `n` and goes down to `1`, which can be replaced with a more efficient loop that starts from `1` and goes up to `n`.

4. Inefficient vector iteration: The code uses a range-based for loop to iterate over the vector `pp` and print its elements. This can be optimized by using an index-based for loop instead.

5. Redundant arithmetic operations: The code performs repeated arithmetic operations on the vector `v`, which can be optimized to reduce the number of computations.

6. Inefficient output printing: The code uses multiple `cout` statements to print the output, which can be replaced with a single output stream.

Based on these observations, the following optimization strategy can be formulated:

1. Replace the unnecessary `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` with specific headers that are required in the code.

2. Initialize the vector `v` with the correct size `n+1` from the beginning.

3. Optimize the loop structure to start from `1` and go up to `n`.

4. Replace the range-based for loop used to print the elements of `pp` with an index-based for loop.

5. Optimize the arithmetic operations performed on the vector `v` to reduce the number of computations.

6. Replace the multiple `cout` statements used to print the output with a single output stream.

Let's now apply these optimization steps to the given code.
