The given code appears to solve a problem that involves manipulating a vector of integers. The code reads an integer `n` from the input, followed by `n` integers that populate a vector `v`. The code then performs a series of operations on `v` and outputs the result.

Upon analyzing the code, the following potential areas of improvement can be identified:

1. Unnecessary includes: The code includes the entire `bits/stdc++.h` library, which is not recommended. Only the necessary headers should be included to reduce compilation time.

2. Redundant typedefs: The code defines `lli`, `ulli`, and `ld` as typedefs, but these types are not used in the code. Removing these typedefs will improve code readability.

3. Redundant macros: The code defines several macros (`S`, `M`, `nl`, `er`, `fast`, `test`, `f0`, `f1`, `pb`, `mp`, `fi`, `se`, `print`, `out`, `Y`, `N`) that are not used in the code. Removing these macros will simplify the code.

4. Inefficient vector initialization: The code initializes a vector `v` of size `n+1` and sets all elements to 0. However, the elements are immediately overwritten in the following loop. It would be more efficient to initialize `v` with the correct values directly in the loop.

5. Redundant calculations: The code performs unnecessary calculations in the inner loops. The loop `for (lli j = 1; j <= i; j++)` can be optimized to only update the necessary elements of `v`, instead of updating all elements up to `i`.

6. Inefficient data structure: The code uses a vector of pairs `pp` to store the operations performed on `v`. However, the operations are always added at the end of the vector. Using a deque instead of a vector would allow for more efficient insertion at both ends.

7. Unnecessary modulo operation: In the line `lli rem = (v[i] - i) % (n + 1)`, the modulo operation can be avoided by directly subtracting `n + 1` if `v[i] - i` is greater than `n + 1`.

Based on these observations, the following optimization strategy can be formulated:

1. Replace the unnecessary includes with the necessary headers (`iostream`, `vector`, `algorithm`, `deque`, `utility`).

2. Remove the unused typedefs and macros.

3. Initialize `v` with the correct values directly in the loop that reads the input.

4. Optimize the inner loops to only update the necessary elements of `v`.

5. Replace the vector `pp` with a deque.

6. Avoid the modulo operation by directly subtracting `n + 1` if `v[i] - i` is greater than `n + 1`.

Now, let's proceed with the step-by-step explanation and optimized code.
