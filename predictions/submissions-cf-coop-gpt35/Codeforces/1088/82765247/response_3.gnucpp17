The given code seems to be solving a problem with some input constraints. It reads an integer `n`, followed by `n` integers into a vector `v`. It then performs some operations on the vector and outputs the results.

Let's analyze the code to identify potential areas for optimization:

1. The code includes unnecessary header files (`<bits/stdc++.h>`) that can be replaced with the specific required headers. This will help reduce compilation time and unnecessary code bloat.

2. The code defines several macros (`#define`) for frequently used constants, functions, and output statements. While macros can improve code readability, they can also be a source of bugs and make the code harder to understand. We should evaluate whether these macros are necessary or if they can be replaced with inline functions or constants.

3. The code uses a vector of pairs (`vector<pair<lli, pair<lli, lli>>>`) to store intermediate results. We need to check if this data structure is the most efficient choice for the problem at hand.

4. The code performs several loops over the vector `v`, updating its elements. We can explore opportunities to optimize these loops by minimizing redundant computations or using more efficient algorithms.
