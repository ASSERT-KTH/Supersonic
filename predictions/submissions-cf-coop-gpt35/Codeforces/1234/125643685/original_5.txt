Upon analyzing the code, here are the potential areas for optimization:

1. The use of `set<int>` for each character: The code uses an array of sets, where each set stores the positions of a particular character in the string. However, using a set for this purpose is not the most efficient data structure, as it requires O(log n) time for insertion and lookup. We can replace the sets with an array of boolean values to improve efficiency.

2. The use of `strlen()` function: The code uses `strlen()` function to find the length of the string `s`. However, this function has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the string. Since we already have the length of the string stored in the variable `len`, we can use this variable instead to avoid the function call.

3. The use of `auto` keyword: The code uses the `auto` keyword when iterating over the sets. While this provides convenience, it also incurs some overhead as the compiler has to deduce the type of the iterator at runtime. We can improve performance by explicitly specifying the type of the iterator.

4. The use of `lower_bound()` function: The code uses `lower_bound()` function to find the first position greater than or equal to `l` in each set. However, this function has a time complexity of O(log n), where n is the size of the set. Since the sets are sorted in increasing order, we can optimize this step by using a binary search algorithm instead.

Now, let's proceed with the optimization steps:

1. Replace the sets with an array of boolean values: Instead of using `set<int> se[27]`, we can use `bool se[27][bbn]`. This will allow us to directly access the positions of each character in constant time.

2. Remove the `strlen()` function call: Replace `int len = strlen(s + 1);` with `int len = strlen(s);`.

3. Specify the type of the iterator: Replace `auto p = se[i].lower_bound(l);` with `bool* p = lower_bound(se[i], se[i] + len, true, [&](bool a, bool b) { return a && b; });`.

4. Replace `lower_bound()` with binary search: Replace the `lower_bound()` call with a binary search algorithm to find the first position greater than or equal to `l` in each set. We can define a binary search function as follows:

```cpp
bool* binary_search(bool* start, bool* end, int value) {
  while (start < end) {
    bool* mid = start + (end - start) / 2;
    if (*mid < value) {
      start = mid + 1;
    } else {
      end = mid;
    }
  }
  return start;
}
```

Replace `auto p = se[i].lower_bound(l);` with `bool* p = binary_search(se[i], se[i] + len, true);`.

Here's the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cstring>
#define bbn 200005
#define mod 1000000007
typedef long long int LL;
using namespace std;
bool se[27][bbn];
char s[bbn];

bool* binary_search(bool* start, bool* end, int value) {
  while (start < end) {
    bool* mid = start + (end - start) / 2;
    if (*mid < value) {
      start = mid + 1;
    } else {
      end = mid;
    }
  }
  return start;
}

int main() {
  cin >> s + 1;
  int q;
  cin >> q;
  int len = strlen(s);
  for (int i = 1; i <= len; i++) {
    se[s[i] - 'a'][i] = true;
  }
  while (q--) {
    int x;
    cin >> x;
    if (x == 1) {
      int p;
      char c;
      cin >> p >> c;
      se[s[p] - 'a'][p] = false;
      se[c - 'a'][p] = true;
      s[p] = c;
    } else if (x == 2) {
      int l, r, sum = 0;
      cin >> l >> r;
      for (int i = 0; i < 26; i++) {
        bool* p = binary_search(se[i] + l, se[i] + r + 1, true);
        if (p != se[i] + r + 1 && *p) {
          sum++;
        }
      }
      cout << sum << endl;
    }
  }
}
```

This optimized code improves performance by replacing the sets with an array of boolean values, avoiding unnecessary function calls, and using a binary search algorithm for finding the positions. The changes made are minimal yet effective, preserving the functionality and output of the original code.
