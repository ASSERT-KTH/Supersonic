Code Analysis:
- The code takes a string as input and performs two types of operations on it.
- The first type of operation is to change a character at a given position in the string.
- The second type of operation is to count the number of unique characters between two given positions in the string.
- The code uses a set of sets to store the positions of each character in the string.
- The code then iterates through the set of sets to count the number of unique characters between two positions.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Avoid using the `bits/stdc++.h` header file, as it includes unnecessary headers and can slow down the compilation process. Instead, include only the necessary headers.
2. Replace the `set<int>` with a more efficient data structure to store the positions of each character. Since the positions are unique and need to be accessed in a specific order, we can use an array of vectors. Each index of the array represents a character, and the corresponding vector stores the positions of that character.
3. Instead of using `strlen` to find the length of the string, store the length in a separate variable after reading the input.
4. When changing a character at a given position, directly access the vector corresponding to the character and update the position value. There is no need to erase and insert elements in a set.
5. When counting the number of unique characters between two positions, iterate over the array of vectors and use a binary search to find the lower bound of the left position. Iterate until the position is less than or equal to the right position and increment a counter for every character found.
6. Use `'\n'` instead of `endl` when printing the output to avoid unnecessary flushing of the stream.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Remove the `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` line and include the necessary headers:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <set>
#include <cstring>
```
2. Replace the `set<int>` with an array of vectors:
```cpp
vector<int> se[26];
```
3. After reading the input, store the length of the string in a separate variable:
```cpp
int len;
cin >> len;
```
4. When changing a character at a given position, update the position directly in the vector corresponding to the character:
```cpp
se[s[p] - 'a'][p - 1] = c - 'a';
```
5. When counting the number of unique characters between two positions, iterate over the array of vectors and use binary search to find the lower bound:
```cpp
int sum = 0;
for (int i = 0; i < 26; i++) {
  auto p = lower_bound(se[i].begin(), se[i].end(), l);
  if (p != se[i].end() && *p <= r)
    sum++;
}
```
6. Replace `endl` with `'\n'` when printing the output:
```cpp
cout << sum << '\n';
```

Optimized Code:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <set>
#include <cstring>
#define bbn 200005
#define mod 1000000007
typedef long long int LL;
using namespace std;
vector<int> se[26];
char s[bbn];
int main() {
  cin >> s + 1;
  int q;
  cin >> q;
  int len = strlen(s + 1);
  for (int i = 1; i <= len; i++) {
    se[s[i] - 'a'].push_back(i);
  }
  while (q--) {
    int x;
    cin >> x;
    if (x == 1) {
      int p;
      char c;
      cin >> p >> c;
      se[s[p] - 'a'][p - 1] = c - 'a';
      s[p] = c;
    } else if (x == 2) {
      int l, r, sum = 0;
      cin >> l >> r;
      for (int i = 0; i < 26; i++) {
        auto p = lower_bound(se[i].begin(), se[i].end(), l);
        if (p != se[i].end() && *p <= r)
          sum++;
      }
      cout << sum << '\n';
    }
  }
}
```

The optimized code uses an array of vectors to store the positions of each character, which provides faster access and modification compared to a set of sets. Other changes, such as using a separate variable to store the length of the string and using `'\n'` instead of `endl`, also contribute to improving the efficiency of the code.
