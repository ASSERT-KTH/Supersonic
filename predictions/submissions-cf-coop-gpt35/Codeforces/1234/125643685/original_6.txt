Code Analysis:
- The code reads a string `s` and a number `q` from the input.
- It then processes `q` queries, each of which can be of two types:
  1. Update query: Given indices `p` and a character `c`, it replaces the character at index `p` in the string `s` with `c`.
  2. Count query: Given indices `l` and `r`, it counts the number of distinct characters in the substring of `s` from index `l` to index `r`.

Potential optimizations:
1. The code currently uses a `set` for each character to store the indices at which the character occurs. This can be inefficient as searching and inserting elements in a set has a time complexity of O(log n). Instead, we can use an array of vectors to store the indices, where the index of the array represents the character.
2. The code currently uses `lower_bound` to find the first index greater than or equal to `l` in each set. This is unnecessary as the indices in each set are stored in sorted order. We can instead use an index variable to keep track of the current index in each set.
3. The code uses `strlen` to calculate the length of the string `s`. This is unnecessary as we can directly use the length of `s` obtained from the input.

Optimization Steps:
1. Replace the `set<int>` with an `vector<int>` array called `indices` of size 26, where each index represents a character.
2. Replace the line `se[s[i] - 'a'].insert(i);` with `indices[s[i] - 'a'].push_back(i);` to store the indices in the corresponding vector.
3. Replace the line `se[s[p] - 'a'].erase(p);` with `indices[s[p] - 'a'].erase(indices[s[p] - 'a'].begin() + p);` to remove the index from the corresponding vector.
4. Replace the line `se[c - 'a'].insert(p);` with `indices[c - 'a'].push_back(p);` to insert the index into the corresponding vector.
5. Replace the line `auto p = se[i].lower_bound(l);` with `int idx = 0;` to initialize the index variable for each character.
6. Replace the line `if (p != se[i].end() && *p <= r)` with `if (idx < indices[i].size() && indices[i][idx] <= r)` to check if the current index is within the range.
7. Increment `idx` inside the loop to move to the next index in the vector.

    indices[s[i] - 'a'].push_back(i);
  }
  while (q--) {
    int x;
    cin >> x;
    if (x == 1) {
      int p;
      char c;
      cin >> p >> c;
      indices[s[p] - 'a'].erase(indices[s[p] - 'a'].begin() + p);
      indices[c - 'a'].push_back(p);
      s[p] = c;
    } else if (x == 2) {
      int l, r, sum = 0;
      cin >> l >> r;
      for (int i = 0; i < 26; i++) {
        int idx = 0;
        while (idx < indices[i].size() && indices[i][idx] <= r) {
          if (indices[i][idx] >= l) {
            sum++;
          }
          idx++;
