Upon analyzing the given code, I have identified several potential optimizations that can improve its performance and memory usage:

1. Avoid using "bits/stdc++.h" header: The inclusion of the "bits/stdc++.h" header is not recommended because it includes many unnecessary standard library headers. Instead, it is better to include only the necessary headers explicitly.

2. Avoid using global variables: The use of global variables can make the code harder to understand and maintain. It is better to pass variables as arguments to functions or define them locally in the main function.

3. Use a more efficient data structure for the tree: The current implementation uses a vector of vectors to represent the tree, which can be inefficient for large trees. Instead, we can use a vector of pairs or a vector of edges to represent the tree.

4. Avoid unnecessary recursive function calls: The function "built_h" uses recursion to build the "h" array. This can be optimized by using a stack-based iterative approach instead of recursion.

5. Use a more efficient sorting algorithm: The current implementation uses the "sort" function to sort the "ve" array. However, we can use a more efficient sorting algorithm like quicksort or mergesort to improve the sorting performance.

6. Use a more efficient search algorithm: The current implementation uses a linear search to find if any child node has a value of 0. This can be optimized by using a more efficient search algorithm like binary search or hash set.

7. Use compiler optimizations: We can use compiler optimizations like loop unrolling or pragma directives to hint the compiler to optimize certain parts of the code.
