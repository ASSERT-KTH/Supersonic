The given code appears to be a C++ program that takes input for a tree structure and outputs the nodes that are not connected to any leaf node. However, there are several areas of the code that can be optimized for improved performance and reduced memory usage.

1. Inefficient Data Structures:
   - The `vector<vector<int>> tree(N)` is used to represent the tree structure. However, this approach can be memory-intensive, especially if the tree is sparse. Instead, we can use an adjacency list representation of the tree, where each node stores its children nodes. This will reduce memory usage and improve cache locality.

2. Redundant Computations:
   - The `built_h` function recursively calculates the height of each node in the tree. However, this information is not used in the rest of the code. Therefore, this computation can be removed to improve performance.

3. Inefficient Loop Iteration:
   - The loop in the `built_h` function iterates over all the children of a node to calculate the height. However, this can be optimized by using a range-based loop, which is more efficient and easier to read.

4. Compiler Optimizations:
   - We can suggest the use of compiler optimizations, such as loop unrolling and vectorization, to improve the performance of the code. These optimizations can be achieved by using compiler-specific pragmas or flags.

Based on these observations, let's optimize the given code.
