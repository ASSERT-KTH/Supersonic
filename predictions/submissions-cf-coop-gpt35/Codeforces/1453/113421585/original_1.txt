The provided code has a few areas that can be optimized for efficiency:

1. The `set<int>` data structure is used to store unique integers. However, since the code only needs to count the number of unique integers, we don't need to store the actual values. We can replace the `set<int>` with an `unordered_set<int>` to improve performance.

2. The `scanf()` function is used to read input, which can be slower compared to other input methods. We can use `cin` instead of `scanf()` for reading input and `cout` instead of `printf()` for printing output. This change can improve the performance of input/output operations.

3. The loop variables `j` and `i` are declared outside the loops and reused in subsequent iterations. It is better to declare the variables inside the loops to limit their scope and improve code readability.

4. The `a` variable is used to store the input integers, but it is not necessary to store them. We can directly insert the integers into the set or unordered set without using an intermediate variable.

Here is the optimized code with the suggested changes:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_set>
using namespace std;

typedef long long ll;
#define INF 1000000000

ll BSDK() {
  int n, m;
  unordered_set<int> s;

  cin >> n >> m;

  for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
    int num;
    cin >> num;
    s.insert(num);
  }

  for (int j = 0; j < m; j++) {
    int num;
    cin >> num;
    s.insert(num);
  }

  return n + m - s.size();
}

int main() {
  int t;
  cin >> t;

  for (int i = 0; i < t; i++) {
    cout << BSDK() << endl;
  }

  return 0;
}
```

These optimizations improve the efficiency of the code by using a more suitable data structure, optimizing input/output operations, and reducing unnecessary variable usage. The changes preserve the functionality and output of the original code while making it more efficient.
