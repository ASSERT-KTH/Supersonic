The given code seems to be a function `BSDK` that reads input from standard input and performs some calculations using a set data structure. The main function calls this `BSDK` function multiple times based on the input provided.

Upon analyzing the code, the following optimizations can be proposed:

1. Remove unnecessary header files: The code includes unnecessary header files `<iostream>` and `<set>`. Since the code only uses the `set` data structure, we can remove the `<iostream>` header.

2. Remove unnecessary preprocessor directives: The `#define INF 1000000000` directive is not used in the code and can be removed.

3. Optimize input reading: The code uses the `scanf` function for input reading. However, using `scanf` can be slower compared to other input reading methods such as `cin` or `getline`. We can replace `scanf` with `cin` for improved performance.

4. Optimize set insertion: The code uses the `insert` function of the `set` data structure to insert elements. However, the `insert` function has a time complexity of O(log n) for balanced trees. Since the elements being inserted are integers, we can use an unordered set (`unordered_set`) instead of `set` for faster insertion with an average time complexity of O(1).

5. Avoid redundant computation: The code computes `n + m - s.size()` to get the required result. Instead of performing subtraction, we can use `n + m` and subtract `s.size()` at the end.
