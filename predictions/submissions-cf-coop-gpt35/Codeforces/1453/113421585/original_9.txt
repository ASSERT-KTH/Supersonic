The given code appears to be a program that reads input from the user and performs a calculation based on the input. The `BSDK` function reads two sets of integers and returns the difference between the total number of elements in the sets and the number of unique elements.

To optimize this code, we can focus on the following areas:

1. Minimize I/O operations: The code currently uses `scanf` and `printf` functions for input and output. These functions can be slow, especially when reading or writing large amounts of data. To improve performance, we can replace them with faster I/O functions like `std::cin` and `std::cout`.

2. Avoid unnecessary memory allocations: The code uses a `set<int>` to store the unique elements. However, using a `set` requires additional memory allocations and can be slower compared to other data structures. We can optimize this by using an array or a `std::unordered_set` to store the unique elements.

3. Use more efficient data structures: The code currently uses a set to store the unique elements. However, sets are generally slower compared to other data structures like arrays or unordered sets. We can optimize this by using an unordered set, which provides constant-time average complexity for insertion and lookup operations.

4. Optimize the loop iterations: The code uses two separate loops to read the elements and insert them into the set. We can combine these loops into a single loop to avoid redundant iterations.

5. Avoid unnecessary function calls: The `BSDK` function is called multiple times in a loop. We can avoid the overhead of function calls by directly including the code of the `BSDK` function within the main loop.

Based on these observations, let's proceed with the optimization steps:

Step 1: Remove unnecessary includes and typedefs:
- The `#include <iostream>` is not needed as we are going to replace the I/O functions.
- The `#define INF 1000000000` is not used in the given code and can be removed.
- The `typedef long long ll` is not used in the given code and can be removed.

Step 2: Replace I/O functions:
- Replace `scanf` and `printf` with `std::cin` and `std::cout` respectively.

Step 3: Optimize the `BSDK` function:
- Replace the `set<int>` with an `unordered_set<int>`.
- Combine the two loops into a single loop to read and insert the elements.
- Calculate the size difference directly within the loop instead of returning the set size and calculating the difference in the main function.

Step 4: Inline the `BSDK` function:
- Remove the `BSDK` function and include its code directly within the main loop.

Now, let's implement these optimizations in the code:
