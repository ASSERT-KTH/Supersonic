The provided code seems to be a function `BSDK` that calculates the difference between the total number of elements in two sets. The function is called multiple times in the `main` function based on the input value of `t`. 

Upon analyzing the code, the following potential areas of improvement can be identified:

1. Use `unordered_set` instead of `set`: The `set` data structure stores elements in a sorted manner, which requires additional time for sorting. On the other hand, `unordered_set` provides constant time complexity for insertion and lookup operations, which can improve the performance of the code.

2. Avoid unnecessary sorting: The current code inserts elements into a set, which automatically sorts the elements. However, the sorted order is not necessary for this problem. Instead of using a set, we can use an unordered set, which does not sort the elements and provides faster insertion and lookup.

3. Use `cin` and `cout` instead of `scanf` and `printf`: The `scanf` and `printf` functions are generally slower compared to `cin` and `cout`. By using `cin` and `cout`, we can potentially improve the overall I/O performance of the code.

4. Optimize loop iterations: The loops in the code can be optimized by using pre-increment `++j` instead of post-increment `j++` for better performance.

Based on these observations, let's proceed with the optimization steps.
