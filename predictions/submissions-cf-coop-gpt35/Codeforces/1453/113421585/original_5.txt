The provided code is a simple program that reads input from the user and performs a set operation to calculate the difference between the number of unique elements in two sets. Here are some potential optimization strategies:

1. Avoid Unnecessary Memory Allocation: The `set` data structure can be memory-intensive, especially when dealing with large data sets. An alternative approach is to use a `unordered_set`, which has a similar interface but generally offers better performance.

2. Remove Redundant Looping: The code currently loops twice to insert elements into the set. However, it can be optimized to loop only once by combining the two loops into a single loop.

3. Use Fast I/O Methods: The `scanf` and `printf` functions are known for their slower performance compared to other I/O methods. Using faster I/O functions, such as `cin` and `cout`, can improve the program's performance.

4. Use More Efficient Data Types: The `long long` data type is unnecessary in this program. Since the maximum value of `n` and `m` is not specified, using a smaller data type, such as `int`, can save memory and improve performance.

Now, let's implement these optimizations step by step:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_set>

int BSDK() {
  int n, m, a;
  std::unordered_set<int> s;
  std::cin >> n >> m;

  for (int j = 0; j < n + m; j++) {
    std::cin >> a;
    s.insert(a);
  }

  return n + m - s.size();
}

int main() {
  int t;
  std::cin >> t;

  for (int i = 0; i < t; i++) {
    std::cout << BSDK() << std::endl;
  }

  return 0;
}
```

In this optimized code, we have replaced the `set` with an `unordered_set` to improve memory efficiency. We combined the two loops into a single loop to reduce redundant iterations. We also replaced the `scanf` and `printf` functions with `cin` and `cout` for faster I/O. Finally, we changed the `ll` data type to `int` since the maximum values of `n` and `m` were not specified.

These optimizations reduce memory usage by using a more efficient data structure and improve performance by reducing unnecessary looping and using faster I/O methods. The trade-off is increased code complexity due to the use of different data structures and I/O methods, but the overall gain in performance justifies this trade-off.
