The given code reads an integer `t`, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m`, and then reads `n` integers followed by `m` integers. It inserts these integers into a set data structure and returns the difference between the total number of integers read and the size of the set.

Based on this analysis, there are a few potential areas for optimization:

1. The use of `set<int>`: The set data structure is efficient for maintaining a sorted collection of unique elements. However, in this case, we only need to count the number of distinct elements. So, using a set is unnecessary and can be replaced with a more efficient approach.

2. The use of `scanf` and `printf`: These input/output functions have some overhead and can be replaced with faster alternatives, such as `cin` and `cout` in C++. Additionally, using `scanf` and `printf` with format specifiers `%d` for integers can lead to undefined behavior if the input values are out of the range of an `int`. It would be safer to use `long long` for reading the input values.

3. Loop iterations: The loops for reading the integers can be optimized to reduce the number of iterations and improve performance.

Based on these observations, let's outline the optimization strategy:

1. Replace the use of `set<int>` with a more efficient approach to count the number of distinct elements.

2. Replace the use of `scanf` and `printf` with `cin` and `cout` respectively.

3. Optimize the loop iterations for reading the integers.

Now, let's proceed with the step-by-step explanation and provide the optimized code.
