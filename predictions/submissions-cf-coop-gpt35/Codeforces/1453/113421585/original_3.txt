Upon analyzing the provided code, the following potential optimizations can be identified:

1. The `set<int>` data structure is being used to store unique elements. However, using a set introduces an additional overhead in terms of memory and time complexity. Since the elements are being inserted one by one, we can use a `unordered_set<int>` instead, which provides similar functionality but with improved efficiency.

2. The input and output operations in the `BSDK()` function are being performed using `scanf()` and `printf()` functions. These functions are relatively slow compared to the C++ standard input/output streams (`cin` and `cout`). Therefore, it is recommended to replace the `scanf()` and `printf()` functions with `cin` and `cout` respectively, for better performance.

3. The loop variables `j` and `i` are declared outside the loops in the `BSDK()` and `main()` functions, respectively. This can lead to potential bugs and makes the code less readable. It is better to declare the loop variables within the loops.

4. The `scanf()` function is used to read the number of test cases (`t`) in the `main()` function. However, there is no error handling for the input. We should add error handling to handle invalid input values.

Based on these observations, the following optimization steps can be proposed:

1. Replace `set<int>` with `unordered_set<int>`.

2. Replace `scanf()` and `printf()` with `cin` and `cout` respectively.

3. Declare the loop variables within the loops.

4. Add error handling for the input of `t` in the `main()` function.

Here is the optimized code with the proposed changes:

```cpp
typedef long long ll;
#define INF 1000000000
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_set>
using namespace std;

ll BSDK() {
  int n, m, a;
  unordered_set<int> s;
  cin >> n >> m;
  for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
    cin >> a;
    s.insert(a);
  }
  for (int j = 0; j < m; j++) {
    cin >> a;
    s.insert(a);
  }
  return n + m - s.size();
}

int main() {
  int t;
  cin >> t;
  if (t <= 0) {
    cout << "Invalid input" << endl;
    return 0;
  }
  for (int i = 0; i < t; i++) {
    cout << BSDK() << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```

These optimizations improve the performance and memory usage of the code by using a more efficient data structure, optimizing the input/output operations, and adding error handling. The code is now more readable and less error-prone.
