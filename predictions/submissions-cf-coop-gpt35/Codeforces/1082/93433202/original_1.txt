## Code Analysis

Upon initial analysis, the following potential performance bottlenecks and inefficient memory usage can be identified in the given code:

1. Unnecessary includes: The code includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header, which is not a standard C++ header and includes a large number of other headers, including ones that might not be necessary for this program. This can lead to increased compilation time and unnecessary memory usage.

2. Unnecessary pragma directive: The `#pragma GCC optimize("O2")` directive is used to optimize the code for speed. While this might provide some performance improvements, it is generally better to rely on compiler optimizations instead of manual pragmas.

3. Excessive use of macros: The code uses macros extensively for shorthand notation and function-like behavior. While this might make the code more concise, it can also make it harder to read and debug. Additionally, the use of macros can lead to code bloat and potential performance issues.

4. Inefficient data structures: The code uses an array `t` to store the input values, but it also uses two separate vectors `one` and `two` to store indices based on the value of `t`. This leads to redundant storage and additional memory usage.

5. Unnecessary calculations: The code performs calculations to check if the sum of the input values is within a certain range. These calculations can be simplified to improve efficiency.

6. Redundant loops: The code uses multiple loops to iterate over the input values and perform operations. Some of these loops can be combined or simplified to reduce the number of iterations.

7. Inefficient sorting: The code uses a priority queue to sort the values in the `two` vector. However, a priority queue is not necessary for this task, as the values can be sorted using a simpler and more efficient algorithm.

## Optimization Strategy

Based on the code analysis, the following optimization strategy can be formulated:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: Replace the non-standard `<bits/stdc++.h>` header with the necessary standard headers required for the program.

2. Remove unnecessary pragma directive: Remove the `#pragma GCC optimize("O2")` directive as it is not necessary and relies on manual optimization rather than compiler optimizations.

3. Replace macros with standard functions: Replace the macros `sz(x)`, `all(x)`, `L(x)`, `R(x)`, and `M(x, y)` with standard C++ functions or inline code. This will improve code readability and avoid potential issues related to macros.

4. Optimize data structures: Replace the separate vectors `one` and `two` with a single vector `indices` that stores pairs of values and indices. This will eliminate redundant storage and reduce memory usage.

5. Simplify calculations: Simplify the calculations to check if the sum of the input values is within the specified range. This can be done by comparing the sum directly with the required bounds.

6. Combine and optimize loops: Combine the loops that iterate over the input values and perform operations to reduce the number of iterations and improve efficiency.

7. Replace priority queue with sorting algorithm: Replace the use of a priority queue to sort the values in the `two` vector with a simple sorting algorithm, such as `std::sort()`. This will improve efficiency and eliminate the need for a priority queue.

## Step-by-Step Explanation

1. Remove unnecessary includes: Replace the non-standard `<bits/stdc++.h>` header with the necessary standard headers required for the program. In this case, the necessary headers are `<iostream>`, `<vector>`, and `<algorithm>`.

2. Remove unnecessary pragma directive: Remove the `#pragma GCC optimize("O2")` directive as it is not necessary and relies on manual optimization rather than compiler optimizations.

3. Replace macros with standard functions: Replace the macros `sz(x)`, `all(x)`, `L(x)`, `R(x)`, and `M(x, y)` with standard C++ functions or inline code. For example, `sz(x)` can be replaced with `x.size()` and `all(x)` can be replaced with `x.begin(), x.end()`.

4. Optimize data structures: Replace the separate vectors `one` and `two` with a single vector `indices` that stores pairs of values and indices. This can be done using the `std::pair` class. Instead of storing just the indices, the vector will now store pairs of values and indices.

5. Simplify calculations: Simplify the calculations to check if the sum of the input values is within the specified range. Instead of calculating `2 * n * (n - 1)` and `2 * n - 2` separately, compare the sum directly with these bounds.

6. Combine and optimize loops: Combine the loops that iterate over the input values and perform operations to reduce the number of iterations and improve efficiency. This can be done by iterating over the input values once and performing the necessary operations within the loop.

7. Replace priority queue with sorting algorithm: Replace the use of a priority queue to sort the values in the `two` vector with a simple sorting algorithm, such as `std::sort()`. This will improve efficiency and eliminate the need for a priority queue.
