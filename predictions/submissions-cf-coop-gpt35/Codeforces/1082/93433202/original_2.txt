The given code appears to solve a problem involving the construction of a graph based on an input array `t`. The graph is constructed by connecting pairs of vertices based on certain conditions. The code then outputs the constructed graph.

Now, let's proceed with the optimization strategy.

## Optimization Strategy

1. Avoid unnecessary library inclusions: The code includes the entire `bits/stdc++.h` library, which is not recommended. This library includes a large number of header files, which may increase the compilation time and memory usage. Instead, we can include only the necessary header files.

2. Avoid using `#define` macros: The code uses macros for common operations such as getting the size of a container or accessing child nodes in a binary tree. However, using macros can lead to unintended behavior and make the code difficult to read and debug. It is recommended to use inline functions or const variables instead.

3. Optimize the calculation of the sum: The code calculates the sum of elements in the array `t` using a loop. Instead of iterating over the array, we can use the `accumulate` function from the `<numeric>` header to calculate the sum in a single line. This can improve the efficiency of the code.

4. Use reserve() function for vectors: The code uses vectors `one`, `two`, and `ans` to store values. Since the size of these vectors is known in advance, we can use the `reserve()` function to allocate memory for the vectors before inserting elements. This can help avoid unnecessary reallocations and improve performance.

5. Avoid unnecessary copies: The code copies elements from the `two` vector to the `q` priority queue. Instead of copying, we can directly use a reference to the element in the `two` vector. This can save memory and improve performance.

6. Avoid unnecessary function calls: The code repeatedly calls `sz()` function to get the size of vectors. Instead, we can store the size of the vector in a variable and reuse it multiple times. This can reduce function call overhead and improve performance.

7. Remove unnecessary conditions: The code checks if `t[x]` is zero before adding an element to the `ans` vector. However, this condition is unnecessary since `t[x]` is already being decremented before adding the element. We can remove this condition to simplify the code.

8. Optimize the output: The code uses `endl` to output a newline character. However, `endl` also flushes the output buffer, which can impact performance. Instead, we can use `"\n"` to output a newline character without flushing the buffer.

Now, let's apply these optimizations step by step.

## Step-by-Step Explanation

Step 1: Remove unnecessary library inclusions and macros.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <numeric>
#include <queue>
#include <utility>

using namespace std;
```

Step 2: Optimize the calculation of the sum.

```cpp
int sum = accumulate(t, t + n, 0);
```

Step 3: Use reserve() function for vectors.

```cpp
vector<int> one, two;
one.reserve(n);
two.reserve(n);
```

Step 4: Avoid unnecessary copies.

```cpp
priority_queue<pair<int, int>, vector<pair<int, int>>, greater<pair<int, int>>> q;
```

Step 5: Avoid unnecessary function calls.

```cpp
int twoSize = two.size();
int oneSize = one.size();
```

Step 6: Remove unnecessary conditions.

```cpp
ans.push_back({one[i], x});
```

Step 7: Optimize the output.

```cpp
cout << "YES " << twoSize + f2 - 1 << "\n";
cout << ans.size() << "\n";
for (const auto& x : ans)
    cout << x.first + 1 << " " << x.second + 1 << "\n";
```

Now, let's apply all these optimizations to the code.

## Optimized Code Block

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <numeric>
#include <queue>
#include <utility>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    cin.tie(nullptr);
    cout.tie(nullptr);
    ios::sync_with_stdio(false);

    int n;
    cin >> n;

    int t[n];
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        cin >> t[i];
    }

    int sum = accumulate(t, t + n, 0);

    if (sum > 2 * n * (n - 1) || sum < 2 * n - 2) {
        cout << "NO";
        return 0;
    }

    vector<int> one, two;
    one.reserve(n);
    two.reserve(n);

    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (t[i] == 1)
            one.push_back(i);
        else
            two.push_back(i);
    }

    vector<pair<int, int>> ans;
    int twoSize = two.size();
    for (int i = 1; i < twoSize; i++) {
        ans.push_back({two[i - 1], two[i]});
        t[two[i - 1]]--;
        t[two[i]]--;
    }

    int f2 = min(2, static_cast<int>(one.size()));
    for (int i = 0; i < f2; i++) {
        if (i == 0)
            ans.push_back({one[i], two[0]}), t[two[0]]--;
        else
            ans.push_back({one[i], two[twoSize - 1]}), t[two[twoSize - 1]]--;
    }

    priority_queue<pair<int, int>, vector<pair<int, int>>, greater<pair<int, int>>> q;
    for (const auto& x : two) {
        q.push({t[x], x});
    }

    int oneSize = one.size();
    for (int i = f2; i < oneSize; i++) {
        int x = q.top().second;
        q.pop();
        ans.push_back({one[i], x});
        t[x]--;
        q.push({t[x], x});
    }

    cout << "YES " << twoSize + f2 - 1 << "\n";
    cout << ans.size() << "\n";
    for (const auto& x : ans)
        cout << x.first + 1 << " " << x.second + 1 << "\n";

    return 0;
}
```

This optimized code is expected to have improved performance in terms of running time and memory usage compared to the original code.
