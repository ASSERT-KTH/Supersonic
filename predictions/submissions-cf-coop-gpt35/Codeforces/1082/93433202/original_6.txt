Upon analyzing the given code, the following potential performance bottlenecks and areas for optimization can be identified:

1. The use of the `bits/stdc++.h` header: This header includes a large number of standard library headers, which can result in increased compilation time and unnecessary inclusion of unused headers. It is recommended to include only the necessary headers explicitly.

2. Use of macros: The macros `S`, `F`, `PB`, `sz`, `all`, `L`, `R`, and `M` can lead to code readability issues and may result in unexpected behavior due to potential macro conflicts. It is better to avoid using macros and instead use explicit function calls or variables.

3. Use of `vector` and `pair` data structures: The code extensively uses `vector` and `pair` data structures, which can result in additional memory usage and potential performance overhead due to dynamic memory allocation. Alternative data structures or optimizations can be explored to reduce memory usage and improve performance.

4. Use of `cin` and `cout` for input/output: The code uses `cin` and `cout` for input and output operations, which can be slower compared to other input/output methods, such as `scanf` and `printf`. Consider using these alternatives for improved performance.

5. Redundant computations: The code performs some redundant computations, such as repeatedly calculating the size of the `two` vector using `sz(two)` and accessing the last element of the `two` vector using `two[sz(two) - 1]`. These computations can be avoided by storing the size in a variable and accessing the last element directly.

Based on these findings, the following optimization strategy can be formulated:

1. Replace the `bits/stdc++.h` header with the necessary standard library headers.

2. Remove the unnecessary macros and replace them with explicit function calls or variables.

3. Investigate alternative data structures or optimizations to reduce memory usage and improve performance.

4. Replace the use of `cin` and `cout` with faster input/output methods, such as `scanf` and `printf`.

5. Eliminate redundant computations to improve efficiency.

Now, let's proceed with the step-by-step explanation and optimized code.
