The given code appears to be a program that performs range updates and queries on an array. The program builds two segment trees, `sgt0` and `sgt1`, to represent the positive and negative elements of the array, respectively. The program then performs a series of updates and queries on these segment trees based on the input.

Upon analyzing the code, I have identified several potential areas for optimization:

1. Memory Usage:
   - The segment trees `sgt0` and `sgt1` are currently allocated as arrays of size `X * 4 + 1`. This may result in excessive memory usage, especially if `X` is large. We can optimize the memory usage by dynamically allocating the segment trees using the `new` operator.

2. Redundant Computations:
   - The `inv` function is used to invert the sign of a given integer. However, the sign inversion can be achieved more efficiently by multiplying the integer by -1. We can replace the calls to `inv` with this multiplication operation.

3. Loop Optimization:
   - The loop in the `main` function that reads the elements of the array can be optimized by using `scanf` with the `%d` format specifier instead of `getchar`. This eliminates the need for a separate loop for reading the elements.

4. Compiler Optimization:
   - We can suggest the compiler to optimize the code by adding the `-O3` flag during compilation. This will enable aggressive optimization techniques, such as loop unrolling and function inlining, which can improve the performance of the program.
