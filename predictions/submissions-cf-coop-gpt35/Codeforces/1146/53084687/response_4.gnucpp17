The given code is an implementation of a segment tree that performs range updates and range queries on an array. The code builds two segment trees, `sgt0` and `sgt1`, where `sgt0` is used to keep track of negative values and `sgt1` is used to keep track of positive values. The `update` function is used to update the segment trees based on the given range and value, and the `query` function is used to perform a range query on the segment trees. Finally, the code applies the range queries on the original array and prints the results.

To optimize this code, we can focus on several areas:

1. Memory Allocation: The code currently uses static arrays for the segment trees, which limits the maximum size of the array to `X`. We can optimize the memory usage by using dynamic memory allocation or by using a different data structure altogether.

2. Redundant Computations: The code performs redundant computations in several places. For example, in the `pushdown` function, the `inv` function is called twice, which can be avoided. Additionally, the code performs unnecessary checks for `x == 0` and `x > 0` in the `main` function.

3. Loop Optimization: The code uses a loop to read input values into the array `a`. We can optimize this loop by using `scanf` with the `%n` specifier to count the number of characters consumed, which will eliminate the need for the `getchar` call.

4. Compiler Optimizations: We can use compiler optimizations, such as loop unrolling or pragma directives, to hint the compiler to optimize certain parts of the code.

Now, let's go through each optimization step in detail:

1. Memory Allocation Optimization:
   - Currently, the code uses static arrays `sgt0` and `sgt1` to store the segment trees. To optimize memory usage, we can dynamically allocate memory for the segment trees using the `new` operator.
   - We can replace the lines `node sgt0[X * 4 + 1], sgt1[X * 4 + 1]` with `node *sgt0 = new node[X * 4 + 1]` and `node *sgt1 = new node[X * 4 + 1]` respectively.
   - This change allows us to allocate memory for the segment trees based on the maximum size required, rather than a fixed size.

2. Redundant Computations Optimization:
   - In the `pushdown` function, the `inv` function is currently called twice. We can remove the redundant call by modifying the code as follows:
     ```
     if (sgt[x].lz == 2) {
       sgt[x << 1].sgn = -sgt[x << 1].sgn;
       sgt[x << 1 | 1].sgn = -sgt[x << 1 | 1].sgn;
       sgt[x << 1].lz = 2 - sgt[x << 1].lz;
       sgt[x << 1 | 1].lz = 2 - sgt[x << 1 | 1].lz;
       sgt[x].lz = 0;
     }
     ```
     - By using `2 - sgt[x << 1].lz` and `2 - sgt[x << 1 | 1].lz`, we can achieve the same effect as the `inv` function without the need for an additional function call.
   - In the `main` function, there are unnecessary checks for `x == 0` and `x > 0`. We can remove these checks since the `update` function handles these cases correctly.

3. Loop Optimization:
   - The loop that reads input values into the array `a` can be optimized using the `%n` specifier in `scanf`. This specifier allows us to count the number of characters consumed by the previous `scanf` calls, which eliminates the need for the `getchar` call.
   - We can modify the loop as follows:
     ```
     int num_chars_consumed = 0;
     for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
       scanf("%d%n", &a[i], &num_chars_consumed);
       getchar();  // Consume the newline character
     }
     ```
     - By using the `%n` specifier, we can count the number of characters consumed by `scanf` and store it in the variable `num_chars_consumed`.
     - After reading the value into `a[i]`, we consume the newline character using `getchar` to ensure correct input processing.

4. Compiler Optimizations:
   - We can use compiler optimizations, such as loop unrolling or pragma directives, to hint the compiler to optimize certain parts of the code. However, the specific optimizations to be used depend on the compiler being used and the target platform. Therefore, it is recommended to consult the compiler documentation for the available optimizations and their usage.
