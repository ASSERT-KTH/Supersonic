First, let's analyze the provided code to identify potential areas for optimization:

1. Inefficient data structures:
   - The code uses a stack to store the visited nodes during the depth-first search (DFS). However, a stack is not necessary for this task, as we can simply use a recursive function to perform the DFS traversal.

2. Redundant computations:
   - The code calculates the minimum cost within each connected component multiple times. This can be avoided by calculating the minimum cost only once per connected component and storing it in a separate array.

3. Unnecessary memory usage:
   - The code uses two separate arrays, `v1` and `v2`, to store the adjacency list for the graph. However, we can optimize memory usage by using a single array and storing both the outgoing and incoming edges for each node.

4. Inefficient loop traversal:
   - The code uses nested loops to iterate over the adjacency list and perform operations on the nodes. This can be optimized by using range-based for loops to iterate over the elements of the adjacency list.

Now, let's formulate an optimization strategy to address these issues:

1. Replace the stack-based DFS traversal with a recursive function.
2. Calculate the minimum cost within each connected component only once and store it in a separate array.
3. Optimize memory usage by using a single array to store both the outgoing and incoming edges for each node.
4. Use range-based for loops to iterate over the elements of the adjacency list.

Next, let's provide a step-by-step explanation of each optimization:

1. Replace the stack-based DFS traversal with a recursive function:
   - Remove the `stack<int> st` declaration and the `st.push(source)` and `st.top()` statements.
   - Replace the `while (!st.empty())` loop with a recursive function, `dfs()`.
   - Pass the `source` node as an argument to the `dfs()` function.
   - Remove the `vis` array and replace it with a `visited` parameter in the `dfs()` function.
   - Mark the node as visited by setting `visited[source] = true`.
   - In the `dfs()` function, iterate over the neighbors of the current node using a range-based for loop.
   - Recursively call the `dfs()` function for unvisited neighbors.

2. Calculate the minimum cost within each connected component only once and store it in a separate array:
   - Replace the `temp` variable with an array, `minCost`, of size `200010`.
   - Initialize `minCost` with a large value, such as `1e9`.
   - In the `dfs2()` function, update `minCost[val]` instead of `temp`.
   - In the `main()` function, initialize `ans` as a `long long int`.
   - Update `ans` by adding `minCost[top]` instead of `temp`.

3. Optimize memory usage by using a single array to store both the outgoing and incoming edges for each node:
   - Remove the `v2` array and replace it with a single array, `v`, of vectors, where `v[i]` represents the adjacency list for node `i`.
   - Update the code to use `v[i].push_back(x)` instead of `v2[x].pb(i)`.

4. Use range-based for loops to iterate over the elements of the adjacency list:
   - Replace the `for` loops that iterate over `v1` and `v2` with range-based for loops.

Now, let's implement the optimized code:
