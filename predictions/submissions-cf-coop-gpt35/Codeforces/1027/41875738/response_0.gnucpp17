This code appears to be solving a graph problem using Depth-First Search (DFS). The code consists of two DFS functions, `dfs` and `dfs2`, which are used to traverse the graph and calculate the minimum cost path. The main function reads the input, calls the DFS functions, and calculates the final answer.

Upon analyzing the code, I have identified several potential areas for optimization:

1. Redundant Memory Usage: The code uses an array of vectors, `v1` and `v2`, to represent the graph. However, these vectors are of fixed size 200010, even though the actual number of vertices may be much smaller. This leads to inefficient memory usage.

2. Inefficient Data Structures: The code uses a stack, `st`, to store the vertices during the first DFS traversal. However, a stack is not the most efficient data structure for this purpose. A deque or a linked list would be more suitable.

3. Unnecessary Computations: The code calculates and stores the minimum cost of each vertex in the `temp` variable during the second DFS traversal. However, this calculation is unnecessary since the minimum cost is already stored in the `cost` array.

4. Inefficient Loop Iteration: The code uses nested loops to iterate over the graph vertices and their children. These loops can be optimized by using range-based loops or iterators instead.

5. Lack of Compiler Optimizations: The code does not make use of any compiler optimizations or pragma directives to hint the compiler for potential optimizations.
