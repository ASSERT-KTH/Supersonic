The given code calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of a set of differences between consecutive elements in an array (`num`) and checks if any of the given numbers (`p`) divide the calculated GCD. If a number is found that divides the GCD, it prints "YES" along with the first element of the array (`x[1]`) and the index of the number that divides the GCD. Otherwise, it prints "NO".

To optimize this code, we can focus on the following parts:

1. Data Structure: The code currently uses an array (`num`) to store the differences between consecutive elements. However, since we only need to calculate the GCD of these differences, we can avoid storing them altogether. We can calculate the GCD on-the-fly while reading the input elements.

2. Loop Optimization: The code uses multiple loops to perform various calculations. We can combine some of these loops to reduce the number of iterations.

3. Compiler Optimizations: We can use compiler optimizations to further optimize the code. For example, we can use compiler flags to enable loop unrolling and other optimizations.

With these optimizations in mind, let's proceed with the step-by-step explanation and the optimized code.

Step 1: Remove the `num` array and calculate the GCD on-the-fly while reading the input elements.

Step 2: Combine the loop that calculates the GCD with the loop that reads the input elements. This will reduce the number of iterations and improve cache locality.

Step 3: Use compiler optimizations to further improve the performance. For example, use loop unrolling to reduce loop overhead and improve instruction-level parallelism.

Step 4: Add comments to highlight the changes made and improve code readability.
