Code Analysis:
1. The code reads two integers, n and m, from input.
2. It then reads n long long integers into the array x[].
3. It calculates the differences between consecutive elements in x[] and stores them in the array num[].
4. It reads m long long integers into the array p[].
5. It calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the elements in num[] starting from index 2 and stores it in the variable mid.
6. It then checks if mid is divisible by any element in p[]. If it is, it prints "YES" along with the first element in x[] and the index of the divisible element in p[]. Otherwise, it prints "NO".

Optimization Strategy:
1. Avoid unnecessary data structures:
   - The set and vector libraries are included but not used in the code. These can be removed to reduce unnecessary memory usage.

2. Reduce unnecessary computations:
   - The gcd() function is called repeatedly in a loop for the elements in num[]. This can be optimized by calculating the gcd in a single pass rather than calling the function multiple times.

3. Compiler optimizations:
   - The code can benefit from compiler optimizations, such as loop unrolling and inline functions. Adding compiler-specific optimization pragmas (e.g., #pragma GCC optimize) can provide hints to the compiler to optimize the code further.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Remove unnecessary data structures:
   - Remove the unnecessary include statements for set and vector libraries.

2. Optimize gcd() function:
   - Replace the gcd() function with the built-in std::gcd() function from the <numeric> library. This function calculates the gcd in a single pass, improving efficiency.

3. Add compiler optimizations:
   - Add compiler-specific optimization pragmas, such as #pragma GCC optimize, to provide hints to the compiler for further optimization.

Optimized Code:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <cstdio>
#include <iostream>
#include <numeric> // Added for std::gcd()
#include <string>
using namespace std;
typedef long long LL;
const int maxn = 3 * 1e5 + 10;
LL x[maxn], p[maxn], num[maxn];
int main() {
  int n, m, flag = 0;
  scanf("%d %d", &n, &m);
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    scanf("%lld", &x[i]);
    num[i] = x[i] - x[i - 1];
  }
  for (int i = 1; i <= m; i++) {
    scanf("%lld", &p[i]);
  }
  LL mid = num[2];
  for (int i = 3; i <= n; i++) {
    mid = gcd(mid, num[i]);
  }
  for (int i = 1; i <= m; i++) {
    if (mid % p[i] == 0) {
      printf("YES\n");
      printf("%lld %d\n", x[1], i);
      return 0;
    }
  }
  printf("NO\n");
  return 0;
}
```

Note: The changes made are minimal yet effective, preserving the functionality and output of the original code. The unnecessary data structures are removed, and the gcd() function is replaced with std::gcd(). Compiler optimizations can be added using pragmas specific to the compiler being used.
