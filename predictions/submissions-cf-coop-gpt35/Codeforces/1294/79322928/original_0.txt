The provided code calculates the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in a set of integers. The program takes input in the form of the number of queries, followed by the value of x, and then takes individual query values. For each query, it calculates the smallest non-negative integer not present in the set and prints it.

However, there are several areas of improvement in terms of performance and memory usage. Let's go through each step of the code and suggest optimizations.

1. Remove unnecessary header files:

The code includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header file, which includes all standard library header files. This is not recommended as it increases the compilation time and includes unnecessary headers. We can remove this line and only include the necessary header files.

2. Replace `set` with `unordered_set`:

The code uses a `set` to store the integers in the range [0, 2*q] initially. However, using an `unordered_set` instead of a `set` can provide faster insertion and deletion operations. Since the order of the integers doesn't matter, we can use an `unordered_set` for better performance.

3. Replace array with vector for dynamic size:

The code uses an array `a` of size `x` to store the frequency of remainder values. However, using a `vector` instead of an array can provide better memory management and allow for dynamic resizing.

4. Avoid unnecessary calculations:

The code calculates `max(2 * q, q + 100)` to determine the size of the initial set. However, this calculation is unnecessary and can be simplified to `2 * q`.

5. Avoid unnecessary multiplication:

The code calculates `z = a[y % x] * x + y % x` to get the index of the element to erase from the set. This calculation can be simplified to `z = y % x` as the value of `a[y % x]` is not used later.

6. Minimize I/O operations:

The code currently uses `std::endl` to flush the output stream after each query. However, using `"\n"` instead of `std::endl` can improve the performance by avoiding unnecessary flushing of the stream.

7. Remove unnecessary function and define lambda function:

The code defines a function `sortbysec` but it is not used anywhere in the code. We can remove this function as it is not needed. Instead, we can use a lambda function directly in the `sort` function.

Taking these optimizations into account, here's the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_set>
#include <algorithm>

int main() {
  std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  std::cin.tie(NULL);

  int tests = 1;
  while (tests-- > 0) {
    int q, x;
    std::cin >> q >> x;
    std::vector<int> a(x, 0);
    std::unordered_set<int> s;

    for (int i = 0; i < 2 * q; i++) {
      s.insert(i);
    }

    while (q-- > 0) {
      int y;
      std::cin >> y;
      int z = y % x;
      s.erase(z);
      a[z]++;
      std::cout << *(s.begin()) << "\n";
    }
  }

  return 0;
}
```

These optimizations simplify the code, improve memory management, and reduce unnecessary calculations and I/O operations. The overall performance is expected to be better compared to the original code.
