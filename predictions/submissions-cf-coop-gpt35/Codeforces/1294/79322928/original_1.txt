Upon analyzing the given code, I have identified several areas that can be optimized for efficiency:

1. Unnecessary includes: The code includes unnecessary headers such as `<algorithm>` and `<bits/stdc++.h>`. These can be removed to reduce compile time and decrease memory usage.

2. Unnecessary defines: The code defines constants `M`, `D`, and `PI`, but none of these constants are used in the code. These defines can be safely removed.

3. Unnecessary function: The `sortbysec` function is defined but not used anywhere in the code. This function can be safely removed.

4. Inefficient data structure: The code uses a set to store a range of values, but the set is initialized with a large number of elements. This can be improved by using a vector instead of a set, as a vector has a lower memory overhead.

5. Redundant computations: The expression `y % x` is computed twice in each iteration of the while loop. This computation can be moved outside the loop to avoid redundant calculations.

6. Unnecessary loop condition: The while loop condition `tests-- > 0` is always true since `tests` is initialized with the value 1. This condition can be simplified to `tests--` to improve code readability.

7. Inefficient output: The code uses `cout` to output a single character at a time. This is inefficient as it involves multiple system calls. Instead, we can use `printf` to output the result in bulk, which can significantly improve efficiency.

Now, let's proceed with optimizing the code step by step.
