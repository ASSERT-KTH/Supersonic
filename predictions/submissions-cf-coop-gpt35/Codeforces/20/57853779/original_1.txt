Code Analysis:
1. The code reads input values for `n` and `m` from the user.
2. If `m` is equal to 0, the code prints `-1` and exits.
3. The code creates a graph using an adjacency list representation.
4. Each edge of the graph is represented as a pair of integers `(b, w)`, where `b` is the adjacent node and `w` is the weight of the edge.
5. The code initializes a priority queue `q` with a pair of integers `(0, x)` where `x` is the starting node.
6. The code uses Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path from the starting node `x` to node `n`.
7. Finally, the code prints the shortest path from `x` to `n`.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Use a more efficient data structure for the adjacency list representation. The current implementation uses a vector of pairs, which requires O(n) time for insertion and O(n) space. Using an unordered_map or a hash_map with node as the key and a list of edges as the value would be more efficient, as it allows for O(1) insertion and O(1) lookup time.
2. Instead of using a priority_queue to store the nodes with their distances, use a min-heap data structure like a binary heap or a Fibonacci heap. This will reduce the time complexity of extracting the minimum element from O(log n) to O(1).
3. Avoid unnecessary memory allocations by resizing the vectors `processed`, `distance`, and `p` to the required size at the beginning of the program.
4. Optimize the loop that constructs the shortest path by using a reverse iterator instead of using `reverse` function.
5. Enable compiler optimizations, such as -O3 flag, to allow the compiler to perform additional optimizations.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Replace the vector of pairs `adj[maxn]` with an unordered_map or a hash_map. This will improve the insertion time from O(n) to O(1) and reduce memory usage.
2. Replace the priority_queue `q` with a min-heap data structure like a binary heap or a Fibonacci heap. This will improve the time complexity of extracting the minimum element from O(log n) to O(1).
3. Resize the vectors `processed`, `distance`, and `p` to the required size at the beginning of the program. This will avoid unnecessary memory allocations and improve efficiency.
4. Replace the loop that constructs the shortest path with a reverse iterator. This will eliminate the need to use the `reverse` function and improve efficiency.
5. Enable compiler optimizations by adding the -O3 flag to the compiler command. This will allow the compiler to perform additional optimizations and improve performance.

Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
#define int long long
const int INF = 1e18;
const int maxn = 100005;

int main() {
  int n, m;
  cin >> n >> m;
  if (m == 0) {
    cout << "-1" << endl;
    return 0;
  }

  unordered_map<int, vector<pair<int, int>>> adj;
  for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
    int a, b, w;
    cin >> a >> b >> w;
    adj[a].push_back({b, w});
    adj[b].push_back({a, w});
  }

  int x = 1;
  vector<bool> processed(n + 1, false);
  vector<int> distance(n + 1, INF);
  vector<int> p(n + 1, -1);
  distance[x] = 0;

  using pii = pair<int, int>;
  priority_queue<pii, vector<pii>, greater<pii>> q;
  q.push({0, x});

  while (!q.empty()) {
    int a = q.top().second;
    q.pop();
    if (processed[a])
      continue;
    processed[a] = true;
    for (auto u : adj[a]) {
      int b = u.first, w = u.second;
      if (distance[a] + w < distance[b]) {
        distance[b] = distance[a] + w;
        p[b] = a;
        q.push({distance[b], b});
      }
    }
  }

  if (p[n] == -1) {
    cout << "-1" << endl;
    return 0;
  }

  vector<int> path;
  for (int v = n; v != x; v = p[v]) {
    path.push_back(v);
  }
  path.push_back(x);

  for (auto it = path.rbegin(); it != path.rend(); ++it) {
    cout << *it << ' ';
  }
  cout << endl;
}
```

The optimized code uses an unordered_map for the adjacency list representation, a min-heap for the priority queue, and avoids unnecessary memory allocations. The loop that constructs the shortest path is optimized using a reverse iterator. Compiler optimizations can be enabled by adding the -O3 flag to the compiler command.
