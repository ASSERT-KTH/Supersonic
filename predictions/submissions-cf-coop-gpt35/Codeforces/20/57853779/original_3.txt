The given code is an implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path between two nodes in a graph. However, there are several areas where the code can be optimized for efficiency. 

1. Avoiding unnecessary memory allocation:
   - The `adj` vector is declared with a fixed size of `maxn`, which may result in unnecessary memory allocation. Instead, we can use a `vector<vector<pair<int, int>>>` to dynamically allocate memory only for the required number of nodes.
   
2. Using a custom comparison function for the priority queue:
   - The `priority_queue` is currently using the default comparison function, which compares the first element of each pair. However, in this case, we need to compare the second element of each pair. By defining a custom comparison function, we can avoid the need to negate the distances when pushing them into the priority queue.
   
3. Avoiding redundant checks:
   - The `processed` vector is used to keep track of whether a node has been processed or not. However, instead of using this vector, we can directly check if the distance of a node is equal to `INF` to determine if it has been processed or not. This saves memory and avoids the need to iterate over the `processed` vector in each iteration.
   
4. Reusing the `distance` vector:
   - The `distance` vector is used to store the minimum distance from the source node to each node. However, after finding the shortest path, we only need the distances of the nodes in the path. We can optimize memory usage by reusing the `distance` vector to store only the distances of the nodes in the path.

5. Using a stack instead of a vector for path reversal:
   - Currently, the path is reversed using the `reverse` function on a vector. This operation has a time complexity of O(n). Instead, we can use a stack to reverse the path in O(n) time complexity.

Here's the optimized code with the above optimizations:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
#define int long long

const int INF = 1e18;
const int maxn = 100005;

int32_t main() {
  int n, m;
  cin >> n >> m;
  
  if (m == 0) {
    cout << "-1" << endl;
    return 0;
  }
  
  vector<vector<pair<int, int>>> adj(n + 1);
  
  for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
    int a, b, w;
    cin >> a >> b >> w;
    adj[a].push_back({b, w});
    adj[b].push_back({a, w});
  }
  
  int x = 1;
  
  vector<int> distance(n + 1, INF);
  vector<int> p(n + 1, -1);
  
  distance[x] = 0;
  
  using pii = pair<int, int>;
  
  priority_queue<pii, vector<pii>, greater<pii>> q;
  q.push({0, x});
  
  while (!q.empty()) {
    int a = q.top().second;
    q.pop();
    
    if (distance[a] == INF)
      continue;
    
    for (auto u : adj[a]) {
      int b = u.first, w = u.second;
      
      if (distance[a] + w < distance[b]) {
        distance[b] = distance[a] + w;
        p[b] = a;
        q.push({distance[b], b});
      }
    }
  }
  
  if (p[n] == -1) {
    cout << "-1" << endl;
    return 0;
  }
  
  stack<int> path;
  
  for (int v = n; v != x; v = p[v]) {
    path.push(v);
  }
  
  path.push(x);
  
  while (!path.empty()) {
    cout << path.top() << ' ';
    path.pop();
  }
  
  cout << endl;
}
```

With these optimizations, the code should run more efficiently and use less memory compared to the original implementation.
