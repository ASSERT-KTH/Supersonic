Based on a thorough analysis of the provided code, the following potential optimizations can be made:

1. Avoid using the "bits/stdc++.h" header: This header includes a large number of other headers, which can increase compilation time and memory usage. It is recommended to include only the necessary headers explicitly.

2. Remove unnecessary macros: The macros defined in the code, such as "fore", "forn", "sz", etc., are not used extensively and can be replaced by their equivalent code. This will improve code readability and maintainability.

3. Replace "pair<int, pt>" with a custom struct: The use of "pair<int, pt>" in the "qs" array can be replaced by a custom struct to improve code readability. This will also eliminate the need for multiple "if" conditions to access the elements of the pair.

4. Use a more efficient data structure for the "nodes" array: The "nodes" array is used to store the nodes of a binary tree. Instead of using an array, it is recommended to use a dynamically allocated memory block to reduce memory fragmentation and improve cache locality.

5. Optimize the "getsum" function: The "getsum" function currently performs unnecessary calculations when the "sval" field of a node is not -1. It can be optimized to directly return the sum value for such nodes.

6. Optimize the "push" function: The "push" function can be optimized to directly return the "sval" value of a node instead of assigning it to a variable and then returning.

7. Optimize the "setVal" function: The "setVal" function currently performs unnecessary assignments when the "pushed" value is -1. It can be optimized to avoid these assignments and reduce unnecessary memory accesses.

8. Optimize the "getPos" function: The "getPos" function can be optimized to directly return -1 when the sum of a node is 0, instead of checking the range of indices.

9. Avoid unnecessary copying of pairs: In the "sub" function, unnecessary copying of pairs is performed. This can be avoided by passing the pairs by reference.

10. Replace the "dead" array with a vector: The "dead" array is used to store the indices of dead elements. Using a vector instead of an array will allow for dynamic resizing and eliminate the need to specify a fixed size.

11. Avoid unnecessary function calls: The "solve" function currently performs unnecessary function calls, such as "getsum" and "setVal", for every iteration of the loop. These function calls can be moved outside the loop to improve performance.

12. Remove unused variables: The variable "ps" is declared but not used in the code. It can be removed to improve code readability.
