The provided code appears to implement a solution to a problem, but it lacks comments and explanations, making it difficult to understand its purpose and functionality. Before proceeding with the optimization, it is important to understand the code and its requirements. 

Upon analyzing the code, the following observations can be made:

1. The code uses a custom tree structure to store and manipulate information.
2. The `setVal` function is used to update the values in the tree.
3. The `getPos` function is used to find the position of a certain value in the tree.
4. The `sub` function updates the tree based on some conditions.
5. The `solve` function processes the input and performs the required operations.
6. The `main` function handles input/output and calls the `solve` function.

Now, let's move on to the optimization strategy.
