To optimize the given C++ program, we can focus on the following areas:

1. Use more efficient data structures: The current implementation uses a custom tree structure implemented using an array. We can replace this with a more efficient data structure, such as a binary search tree or a segment tree, to improve performance.

2. Eliminate unnecessary computations: There are certain computations that are unnecessarily repeated or can be avoided altogether. We can identify and eliminate these redundant computations to reduce the overall running time.

3. Optimize loops and recursive calls: There may be opportunities to optimize loops and recursive calls by applying techniques like loop unrolling or tail recursion. These optimizations can help reduce the number of iterations and improve performance.

4. Use compiler optimizations: We can use compiler optimizations to hint the compiler about specific optimizations that can be applied. This can be done using compiler-specific pragmas or flags.

Now, let's go through each step of the optimization process in detail:

Step 1: Code Analysis
---------------------
The code implements a simulation of a game. It processes a series of queries, updates the game state, and determines the final outcome. The current implementation uses a custom tree structure to track the game state. However, there are certain areas of the code that can be optimized for better performance.

Step 2: Optimization Strategy
----------------------------
1. Replace the custom tree structure with a segment tree: The current implementation uses a custom tree structure implemented using an array. We can replace this with a more efficient data structure, such as a segment tree, to improve performance. A segment tree is a balanced binary tree that allows efficient range queries and updates.

2. Eliminate unnecessary computations: There are certain computations that are unnecessarily repeated or can be avoided altogether. We can identify and eliminate these redundant computations to reduce the overall running time. For example, we can avoid recomputing the sum of a subtree by storing the sum at each node in the segment tree.

3. Optimize loops and recursive calls: We can optimize loops and recursive calls by applying techniques like loop unrolling or tail recursion. These optimizations can help reduce the number of iterations and improve performance.

4. Use compiler optimizations: We can use compiler optimizations to hint the compiler about specific optimizations that can be applied. This can be done using compiler-specific pragmas or flags.

Step 3: Step-by-Step Explanation
-------------------------------
1. Replace the custom tree structure with a segment tree:
   - The current implementation uses a custom tree structure implemented using an array. We can replace this with a segment tree, which is a more efficient data structure for this problem.
   - A segment tree is a balanced binary tree that allows efficient range queries and updates.
   - We can use the following implementation for the segment tree:
     ```cpp
     struct SegmentTreeNode {
       int sum;
       int sval;
       SegmentTreeNode* left;
       SegmentTreeNode* right;
       SegmentTreeNode() : sum(0), sval(-1), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
       SegmentTreeNode(int sum, int sval, SegmentTreeNode* left, SegmentTreeNode* right)
           : sum(sum), sval(sval), left(left), right(right) {}
     };

     SegmentTreeNode nodes[M]; // M is the maximum number of nodes in the segment tree
     int szn = 0; // Current size of the segment tree

     SegmentTreeNode* getSegmentTreeNode(int sum, int sval, SegmentTreeNode* left, SegmentTreeNode* right) {
       assert(szn < M);
       nodes[szn] = SegmentTreeNode(sum, sval, left, right);
       return &nodes[szn++];
     }
     ```

2. Eliminate unnecessary computations:
   - Currently, the `getsum` function recomputes the sum of a subtree every time it is called. We can eliminate this redundant computation by storing the sum at each node in the segment tree.
   - Modify the `SegmentTreeNode` struct to store the sum of the subtree rooted at each node:
     ```cpp
     struct SegmentTreeNode {
       int sum;
       int sval;
       SegmentTreeNode* left;
       SegmentTreeNode* right;
       SegmentTreeNode() : sum(0), sval(-1), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
       SegmentTreeNode(int sum, int sval, SegmentTreeNode* left, SegmentTreeNode* right)
           : sum(sum), sval(sval), left(left), right(right) {}
     };
     ```

3. Optimize loops and recursive calls:
   - There are no specific optimizations that can be applied to loops or recursive calls in the given code.

4. Use compiler optimizations:
   - We can use compiler optimizations to hint the compiler about specific optimizations that can be applied. This can be done using compiler-specific pragmas or flags. However, since the given code does not contain any computationally intensive sections, compiler optimizations may not have a significant impact.

Step 4: Optimized Code Block
---------------------------
Here is the optimized code after applying the above-mentioned optimizations:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

const int INF = int(1e9);
const int N = 250 * 1000 + 555;
const int M = 30 * 1000 * 1000 + 555;

struct SegmentTreeNode {
  int sum;
  int sval;
  SegmentTreeNode* left;
  SegmentTreeNode* right;
  SegmentTreeNode() : sum(0), sval(-1), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
  SegmentTreeNode(int sum, int sval, SegmentTreeNode* left, SegmentTreeNode* right)
      : sum(sum), sval(sval), left(left), right(right) {}
};

SegmentTreeNode nodes[M];
int szn = 0;

SegmentTreeNode* getSegmentTreeNode(int sum, int sval, SegmentTreeNode* left, SegmentTreeNode* right) {
  assert(szn < M);
  nodes[szn] = SegmentTreeNode(sum, sval, left, right);
  return &nodes[szn++];
}

int getSum(SegmentTreeNode* t, int len) {
  if (!t) return 0;
  if (t->sval != -1) return len * t->sval;
  return t->sum;
}

int push(SegmentTreeNode* t) {
  int pushed = t->sval;
  t->sval = -1;
  return pushed;
}

void update(SegmentTreeNode* t, int l1, int l2) {
  t->sum = getSum(t->left, l1) + getSum(t->right, l2);
}

SegmentTreeNode* setVal(SegmentTreeNode* t, int l, int r, int lf, int rg, int val, int pushed = -1) {
  SegmentTreeNode* nt = t ? getSegmentTreeNode(t->sum, t->sval, t->left, t->right) : getSegmentTreeNode(0, -1, nullptr, nullptr);
  if (pushed != -1) nt->sval = pushed;
  if (l == lf && r == rg) {
    nt->sval = val;
    return nt;
  }
  int mid = (l + r) >> 1;
  pushed = push(nt);
  if (lf < mid) nt->left = setVal(nt->left, l, mid, lf, min(mid, rg), val, pushed);
  else if (pushed != -1) nt->left = nt->left ? getSegmentTreeNode(nt->right->sum, pushed, nt->right->left, nt->right->right) : getSegmentTreeNode(0, pushed, nullptr, nullptr);
  if (rg > mid) nt->right = setVal(nt->right, mid, r, max(lf, mid), rg, val, pushed);
  else if (pushed != -1) nt->right = nt->right ? getSegmentTreeNode(nt->left->sum, pushed, nt->left->left, nt->left->right) : getSegmentTreeNode(0, pushed, nullptr, nullptr);
  update(nt, mid - l, r - mid);
  return nt;
}

int getPosition(SegmentTreeNode* t, int l, int r, int lf, int rg) {
  if (!t) return -1;
  if (l == lf && r == rg) {
    if (l + 1 == r) return getSum(t, 1) ? l : -1;
    if (getSum(t, r - l) == 0) return -1;
  }
  if (t->sval != -1) return t->sval > 0 ? rg - 1 : -1;
  int mid = (l + r) >> 1;
  int ans = -1;
  if (rg > mid && ans == -1) ans = max(ans, getPosition(t->right, mid, r, max(lf, mid), rg));
  if (lf < mid && ans == -1) ans = max(ans, getPosition(t->left, l, mid, lf, min(mid, rg)));
  return ans;
}
