This code appears to be solving a problem involving queries and updates on a binary tree-like data structure. The main optimization opportunities in this code include:

1. Inefficient data structure: The current implementation uses a custom binary tree structure using an array of `node` objects. This approach can be inefficient in terms of memory usage and traversal time.

2. Redundant computations: The code performs multiple unnecessary computations, such as recomputing the sum of nodes in the tree during updates and queries.

3. Inefficient loop structure: The code uses a for loop to process each query, which can be optimized by eliminating unnecessary iterations.

4. Lack of compiler optimizations: The code does not use any compiler optimizations or pragma directives that can hint the compiler to optimize certain parts of the code.

Now, let's proceed with the optimization strategy step by step.
