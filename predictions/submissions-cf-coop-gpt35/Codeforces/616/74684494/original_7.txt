After analyzing the given code, I have identified several areas that can be optimized to improve performance and reduce memory usage:

1. Inefficient Data Structures: The current code uses an array `freq` to store the frequency of each element in the input array `x`. However, `freq` is declared with a size of 1,000,000, even though the input values are in the range of 0 to 500,000. This results in inefficient memory usage.

2. Redundant Computation: The code computes `r - l + 1` multiple times within the loop. This computation can be optimized by storing the value in a variable and updating it only when necessary.

3. Compiler Optimization: The code does not include any compiler optimization flags or pragmas. Adding appropriate compiler optimization flags or pragmas can hint the compiler to optimize the code further.

Based on these observations, here is the step-by-step explanation of the proposed optimizations:

1. Efficient Data Structures: Instead of using an array of size 1,000,000, we can use an unordered map or hash map to store the frequency of each element in `x`. This will reduce the memory usage and provide faster access to the frequency values.

2. Redundant Computation: Instead of computing `r - l + 1` multiple times, we can store the value in a variable `length` and update it only when necessary. This will reduce the number of computations and improve performance.

3. Compiler Optimization: We can add compiler optimization flags or pragmas to hint the compiler to optimize the code further. For example, we can use `-O3` optimization flag for GCC or Clang compilers to enable aggressive optimization.

Here is the optimized code with the proposed optimizations:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <stdio.h>

using namespace std;

int n, k;
int x[500000];
unordered_map<int, int> freq;
int l, r = 0;
int rf, lf;
int mx = -1;
int c = 0;

int main() {
  scanf("%d%d", &n, &k);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    scanf("%d", &x[i]);
  
  while (r < n) {
    freq[x[r]]++;
    if (freq[x[r]] == 1) {
      c++;
    }
    if (c <= k) {
      int length = r - l + 1;
      if (length > mx) {
        rf = r;
        lf = l;
        mx = length;
      }
    }
    while (c > k) {
      if (freq[x[l]] == 1)
        c--;
      freq[x[l]]--;
      l++;
    }
    r++;
  }
  
  printf("%d %d", lf + 1, rf + 1);
}
```

These optimizations will improve the performance of the code by reducing memory usage and eliminating redundant computations. The trade-off is that the code becomes slightly more complex due to the use of unordered map and the introduction of an additional variable to store the length. However, the overall improvement in performance justifies these trade-offs.
