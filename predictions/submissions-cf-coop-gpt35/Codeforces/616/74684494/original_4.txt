The given code appears to solve a problem where we need to find the longest subarray that contains at most k distinct elements from an array of integers. However, there are several areas where the code can be optimized.

1. Redundant `#include` Statements: The code includes unnecessary headers `<algorithm>` and `<iostream>`. Since we are not using any functions or classes from these headers, we can remove them.

2. Unused Variables: The variables `mx` and `rf` are declared but never used. We can safely remove these variables.

3. Unnecessary Initialization: The array `freq` is initialized with zeros using the syntax `{0}`. However, this is not required since we are immediately overwriting the elements in the `while` loop.

4. `using namespace std`: This line is generally considered bad practice as it pollutes the global namespace. We can remove this line and use the `std::` prefix for standard library objects and functions.

5. `scanf` and `printf`: The code uses the C-style input/output functions `scanf` and `printf` for reading input and printing output. While these functions are not inherently inefficient, using C++'s `cin` and `cout` can provide better code readability and performance due to their internal optimizations.

6. Loop Optimization: The code uses a sliding window approach to find the longest subarray. However, the current implementation checks the entire subarray for each `r` value. We can optimize this by maintaining a separate variable `maxLen` to keep track of the maximum length and update it only when necessary.

Now, let's apply these optimizations step by step.
