The provided code finds the longest subarray with at most `k` distinct elements in an array `a`. However, there are several areas in the code that can be optimized for efficiency:

1. Avoid using the `bits/stdc++.h` header: The `bits/stdc++.h` header is not standard and can slow down the compilation process. Instead, include specific headers that are required for the program, such as `<iostream>`, `<vector>`, and `<algorithm>`.

2. Remove unnecessary `using` statements: The `using namespace std;` statement can lead to naming conflicts and slow down the compilation process. It is better to use the `std::` prefix when accessing standard library functions and types.

3. Avoid unnecessary memory allocation: The code uses a frequency array `cnt` to keep track of the count of each element in the subarray. However, the size of this array is unnecessarily large (`N = 1200300`). Since the elements of `a` are integers, it is more efficient to use a `std::unordered_map<int, int>` to store the frequency count of each element.

4. Optimize the inner loop: The inner loop iterates over the array `a` and updates the frequency count of each element. However, this can be optimized by using a sliding window approach. Instead of starting from the beginning of `a` for each `i`, we can continue from the previous `j` position and update the frequency count accordingly.

5. Avoid unnecessary conditional statements: The code uses conditional statements to check if the frequency count for each element is 1 or 0. However, this can be avoided by using the `erase` function of `std::unordered_map` when the count reaches 0.

6. Optimize the calculation of the subarray length: The code uses the variable `leng` to keep track of the length of the subarray. However, this can be optimized by using `j - i` directly, as `j` represents the end index of the subarray.

7. Use `emplace_back` instead of `push_back`: The code uses `push_back` to insert elements into the vector `a`. However, `emplace_back` can be used instead, which avoids unnecessary copying or moving of elements.

Based on these optimizations, here's the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>

int main() {
  std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  std::cin.tie(nullptr);

  int n, k;
  std::cin >> n >> k;

  std::vector<int> a(n);
  for (auto& it : a)
    std::cin >> it;

  std::unordered_map<int, int> cnt;
  int idx1 = -1, idx2 = -1;
  int maxLen = 0;
  int j = 0;

  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    while (j < n && cnt.size() <= k) {
      if (++cnt[a[j]] == 1)
        cnt.erase(a[j]);
      ++j;
    }

    int len = j - i - 1;
    if (len > maxLen) {
      maxLen = len;
      idx1 = i;
      idx2 = j - 1;
    }

    if (--cnt[a[i]] == 0)
      cnt.erase(a[i]);
  }

  std::cout << idx1 + 1 << ' ' << idx2 << "\n";
  return 0;
}
```

These optimizations help in reducing unnecessary memory allocation, improving the time complexity, and reducing the number of conditional statements in the code.
