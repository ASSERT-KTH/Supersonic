The given code is trying to find the longest subarray with at most `k` distinct elements. However, there are several areas where the code can be optimized to improve its performance and memory usage.

1. Unnecessary `#include` Directive: The code includes the entire `bits/stdc++.h` header, which is not necessary for this program. We can remove this line and include only the necessary headers, such as `iostream` and `vector`.

2. Unnecessary `using` Directive: The code uses the `using` directive for `std` namespace, but it only needs the `std::ios_base` class. We can remove the `using namespace std` line and change the `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false)` line to `std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false)`.

3. Redundant `const` Declaration: The code declares `int const MOD = 1e9 + 7`, but it is not used anywhere in the program. We can remove this line.

4. Inefficient Data Structure: The code uses an array `cnt` of size `N` to keep track of the count of each element. However, the maximum value of `N` is much larger than the maximum value of `n`, which leads to inefficient memory usage. We can optimize this by using a `std::unordered_map` instead of the array. This will allow us to dynamically store the count of each element without wasting memory.

5. Redundant Length Variable: The code uses the variable `leng` to store the length of the current subarray. However, this variable is not necessary. We can replace it with the size of the unordered map, which represents the number of distinct elements in the subarray.

6. Unnecessary `auto` Keyword: The code uses the `auto` keyword in the range-based for loop, but it is unnecessary. We can change it to use `int` directly.

7. Inefficient Loop Structure: The code uses nested loops to find the longest subarray. This can be optimized by using a single loop and updating the indices as needed.

8. Inefficient Count Update: The code uses `++cnt[a[j]]` and `--cnt[a[j]]` to update the count of each element. However, this can be optimized by using `std::unordered_map::insert` and `std::unordered_map::erase` functions. These functions have constant time complexity and can be used to update the count more efficiently.

9. Inefficient Size Calculation: The code uses `j - i` to calculate the size of the subarray. However, this can be optimized by using `j - i + 1` to include the current element in the subarray size.
