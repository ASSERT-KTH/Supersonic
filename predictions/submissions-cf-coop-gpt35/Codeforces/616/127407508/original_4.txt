The given code is finding the longest subarray with at most k distinct elements. It uses an array `cnt` to keep track of the count of each element in the current subarray. The algorithm uses two pointers `i` and `j` to maintain a sliding window, and updates the count and length of the subarray accordingly.

Here are some potential optimizations for this code:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The code includes `<bits/stdc++.h>`, which includes a large number of standard library headers. This can increase the compilation time and the memory usage. Instead, we can include only the required headers, such as `<iostream>` and `<vector>`. 

2. Avoid using the `using namespace std;` directive: It is generally considered a good practice to avoid using this directive, as it can lead to naming conflicts. Instead, we can use the `std::` prefix for standard library types and functions.

3. Replace `vector<int>` with `array<int, N>`: Since the maximum size of the array `a` is known at compile-time, we can use `std::array` instead of `std::vector` to potentially improve performance by reducing dynamic memory allocation.

4. Use prefix increment/decrement operators: Instead of using `++cnt[a[j]]` and `--cnt[a[j]]`, we can use the prefix increment/decrement operators to avoid unnecessary copies of the `cnt[a[j]]` value.

5. Use a more efficient data structure to count distinct elements: The current implementation uses an array `cnt` to count the occurrences of each element in the subarray. However, this approach has a time complexity of O(n) for each distinct element. We can use an `unordered_map` or a `std::map` to count the distinct elements and their occurrences in the subarray, reducing the overall time complexity.

6. Optimize inner loop termination condition: The inner loop terminates when the number of distinct elements in the current subarray exceeds `k`. However, we can optimize this condition by checking if `leng == k+1` instead of `leng > k`. This way, we avoid an unnecessary decrement of `leng` when it is already equal to `k+1`. This optimization reduces the number of operations in the inner loop.

7. Avoid unnecessary updates of `leng` and `cnt` in the outer loop: Currently, `leng` and `cnt` are decremented in the outer loop even when the inner loop is not executed. We can avoid these unnecessary updates by checking if the inner loop was executed before decrementing `leng` and `cnt`.

Based on these optimizations, here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <array>
#include <unordered_map>
using namespace std;

const int MOD = 1e9 + 7;
using ll = long long;
const int N = 1200300;

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(nullptr);

  int n, k;
  cin >> n >> k;
  
  array<int, N> a;
  for (auto &it : a)
    cin >> it;

  int idx1 = -1, idx2 = -1, leng = 0;
  int j = 0;

  unordered_map<int, int> cnt;

  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    // Check if the inner loop is executed
    bool innerLoopExecuted = false;

    for (; j < n; j++) {
      if (++cnt[a[j]] == 1)
        leng++;

      // Optimize inner loop termination condition
      if (leng == k+1) {
        if (--cnt[a[j]] == 0)
          leng--;
        innerLoopExecuted = true;
        break;
      }
    }

    if (innerLoopExecuted && j - i > idx2 - idx1) {
      idx1 = i;
      idx2 = j;
    }

    if (--cnt[a[i]] == 0 && innerLoopExecuted)
      leng--;
  }

  cout << idx1 + 1 << ' ' << idx2 << "\n";
  return 0;
}
```

These optimizations aim to improve the code's efficiency and reduce memory usage. However, it's important to note that the impact of these optimizations may vary depending on the input size and characteristics. It's recommended to measure the performance before and after applying the optimizations to assess their effectiveness.
