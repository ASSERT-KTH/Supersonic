Code Analysis:
1. The code includes a large number of preprocessor directives and typedefs, which make the code difficult to read and understand.
2. The code uses a global array `init` and `goal` to store the initial and goal values, which may lead to inefficient memory usage.
3. The code uses a global vector `res` to store the result, which may lead to unnecessary memory allocation and deallocation.
4. The code uses recursion to perform a depth-first search on a graph, which may result in stack overflow for large input sizes.
5. The code uses the `repo` macro to iterate over an array in reverse order, but it is not necessary in this case as the loop can be easily written using a standard `for` loop.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Remove unnecessary preprocessor directives and typedefs to simplify the code and improve readability.
2. Replace the global arrays `init` and `goal` with local variables to reduce memory usage.
3. Replace the global vector `res` with a local variable to avoid unnecessary memory allocation and deallocation.
4. Replace the recursive DFS function with an iterative implementation to avoid stack overflow.
5. Replace the `repo` macro with a standard `for` loop to improve code readability.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Remove unnecessary preprocessor directives and typedefs to simplify the code and improve readability.
2. Replace the global arrays `init` and `goal` with local variables to reduce memory usage:
   - Change the signature of the `dfs` function to accept the arrays as arguments.
   - Pass the arrays as arguments when calling the `dfs` function.
3. Replace the global vector `res` with a local variable to avoid unnecessary memory allocation and deallocation:
   - Declare a local vector `res` inside the `solve` function.
   - Replace all references to the global vector `res` with the local vector `res`.
4. Replace the recursive DFS function with an iterative implementation to avoid stack overflow:
   - Create a stack to store the nodes to be visited.
   - Initialize the stack with the root node.
   - While the stack is not empty, pop a node from the stack and process it.
   - If the node's parent is not 0, update the node's value based on the parent's value.
   - If the node's value is not equal to the goal value, increment the answer and add the node to the result vector.
   - Push all the node's children onto the stack.
5. Replace the `repo` macro with a standard `for` loop to improve code readability:
   - Replace `repo(i, n)` with `for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--)` in the `solve` function.
