The given code is a C++ program that takes input values and performs a depth-first search (DFS) on a graph. The goal is to optimize the code for efficiency, particularly in terms of running time and memory usage.

Upon analyzing the code, here are some potential optimizations that can be made:

1. Remove unnecessary header files: The line `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` includes a large number of standard C++ header files, which may not all be necessary for this program. We can replace this line with specific header files that are actually needed.

2. Remove unused macros: There are several macros defined in the code that are not used. We can remove these macros to simplify the code and improve readability.

3. Avoid using global variables: The variables `n`, `init`, `goal`, `ans`, `g`, and `res` are declared as global variables. It is generally better to avoid using global variables as they can lead to potential issues and make the code harder to understand. We can pass these variables as function arguments instead.

4. Optimize the DFS function: The `dfs` function performs a DFS on the graph. However, it can be optimized by removing unnecessary parameters and simplifying the logic. We can modify the function to take only the necessary parameters and remove the `ppre` and `pre` parameters, as they are not used. Additionally, we can use a reference to `init` instead of accessing it through the global variable.

5. Improve memory usage: The `res` vector is used to store the result of the DFS, but it is not pre-allocated with a size. This can lead to frequent reallocation and copying of elements, which can be inefficient. We can reserve the necessary space in the vector before performing the DFS to avoid unnecessary reallocation.

6. Use `emplace_back` instead of `push_back`: When adding elements to the `res` vector, we can use `emplace_back` instead of `push_back`. This can avoid unnecessary copies or moves of elements and improve performance.

7. Remove unused variables: The variable `t` is defined but not used in the `main` function. We can remove this variable to avoid unnecessary computations.

8. Remove unnecessary output buffering: The `fast` macro disables output buffering, but there is no explicit need for this in the given code. We can remove this macro.
