The given code is a C++ program that solves a graph problem. It reads input values from the user, performs some calculations, and outputs the result.

Upon analyzing the code, several potential areas of improvement can be identified:

1. Redundant includes: The code includes the entire `bits/stdc++.h` library, which is not necessary for this program. It is best to include only the required standard libraries.

2. Excessive use of macros: The code uses macros extensively, which can make the code harder to read and understand. It is recommended to replace these macros with functions or inline code for better readability.

3. Inefficient data structures: The code uses `vector` for storing the graph, which is not the most efficient data structure for this purpose. Switching to a more suitable data structure, such as an adjacency list representation, can improve performance.

4. Unnecessary calculations: The code performs unnecessary calculations in the `sub` function. The modulo operation is applied twice on the same number, which can be optimized to a single operation.

5. Inefficient recursion: The `dfs` function uses recursion to traverse the graph. However, this recursive approach can be slow and memory-intensive for large graphs. It can be optimized using an iterative approach or by using tail recursion.

Based on these observations, the following optimization strategy can be formulated:

1. Replace the `bits/stdc++.h` include with the required standard library headers.

2. Replace the macros with functions or inline code to improve readability.

3. Change the data structure for storing the graph from a vector to an adjacency list representation.

4. Optimize the `sub` function to perform the modulo operation only once.

5. Optimize the recursive `dfs` function by using an iterative approach or tail recursion.
