The given code seems to be solving a dynamic programming problem using recursion and memoization. However, there are several areas of the code that can be optimized to improve its efficiency. 

1. Unnecessary Includes: The code includes the entire `<bits/stdc++.h>` library, which includes all standard C++ libraries. This can increase the compile time and unnecessarily bloat the code. It is better to include only the required libraries.

2. Unnecessary Typedefs: The code defines several typedefs that are not used. Removing these typedefs will improve code readability.

3. Macros: The code uses macros for various purposes, such as defining loops and sorting. Macros can make the code harder to understand and debug. It is better to use functions or templates instead.

4. Redundant Code: The code includes the `rev` macro twice, which is unnecessary.

5. Magic Numbers: The code uses magic numbers like `0`, `1`, and `2` without any explanation. It is better to use named constants or enums for better code readability.

6. Function Naming: The function `dpF` does not have a descriptive name, making it difficult to understand its purpose. It is better to give functions meaningful names.

7. Local Variable Names: The code uses variable names like `op1`, `op2`, and `op3`, which do not provide any information about their purpose. It is better to use descriptive names for better code readability.

8. Code Structure: The code is structured in a single file without any separation of concerns. It is better to separate the code into multiple files and use appropriate data structures and functions.

Based on these observations, the following optimization strategy can be proposed:

1. Remove unnecessary includes and typedefs.
2. Replace macros with functions or templates.
3. Remove redundant code.
4. Replace magic numbers with named constants or enums.
5. Rename functions and variables with descriptive names.
6. Optimize the recursive function `dpF` to avoid repeated calculations and unnecessary function calls.
7. Use appropriate data structures and algorithms to improve efficiency.
8. Separate concerns and improve the code structure.
