Code Analysis:
- The code includes a large number of unnecessary header files, macros, and typedefs. These can be removed to improve code readability and reduce compilation time.
- The code includes multiple unused functions and macros, such as `debug` and `asche`. These can be removed to simplify the code.
- The code defines multiple unnecessary macros, such as `FastIO`, `F`, `S`, `MP`, `UB`, `LB`, `nw`, `issq`, `rev`, `srt`, `grtsrt`, `all`, `mnv`, `mxv`, `valid`, `one`, and `setPrec`. These macros should be removed to improve code readability and avoid potential bugs.
- The code uses a recursive function `dpF` to solve a dynamic programming problem. However, the function uses a top-down approach without memoization, resulting in redundant computations. Memoization can be added to avoid recomputing the same subproblems.
- The code uses a 2D array `dp` to store the results of subproblems. However, the size of the array is unnecessarily large (`maxn x 3`) and can be reduced to the actual size needed (`n x 3`).
- The code uses a global variable `n` to store the input size. It is better to pass the size as a function argument to avoid global variables.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Remove unnecessary header files, macros, and typedefs.
2. Remove unused functions and macros.
3. Remove unnecessary macros.
4. Add memoization to the `dpF` function to avoid redundant computations.
5. Reduce the size of the `dp` array to the actual size needed.
6. Pass the size of the input as a function argument instead of using a global variable.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Remove unnecessary header files, macros, and typedefs:
   - The `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` includes unnecessary header files. We can include only the required header files for this code.
   - The typedefs `ll`, `vi`, `V`, and `mp` are not used in the code and can be removed.

2. Remove unused functions and macros:
   - The `debug` and `asche` macros are not used in the code and can be removed.

3. Remove unnecessary macros:
   - The macros `FastIO`, `F`, `S`, `MP`, `UB`, `LB`, `nw`, `issq`, `rev`, `srt`, `grtsrt`, `all`, `mnv`, `mxv`, `valid`, `one`, and `setPrec` are not used in the code and can be removed.

4. Add memoization to the `dpF` function:
   - The `dpF` function can be modified to use memoization to avoid recomputing the same subproblems. We can add an additional parameter to the function to store the memoized results. We can use a 2D array `dp` of size `n x 3` to store the results of subproblems. Before making a recursive call, we can check if the result for the current subproblem is already computed and return it if available.

5. Reduce the size of the `dp` array:
   - The `dp` array is currently defined as `ll dp[maxn][3]`, where `maxn` is unnecessarily large. We can reduce the size of the `dp` array to `ll dp[n][3]` to save memory.

6. Pass the size of the input as a function argument:
   - The global variable `n` can be removed and the size of the input can be passed as a function argument to the `solve` function.
