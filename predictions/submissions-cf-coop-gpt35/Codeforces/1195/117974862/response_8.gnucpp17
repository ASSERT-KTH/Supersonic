The given code is a C++ program that solves a dynamic programming problem. However, the code contains several inefficient practices and potential performance bottlenecks that can be optimized. Let's analyze the code and propose a step-by-step optimization strategy.

1. **Remove unnecessary header files**: The code includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header file, which includes all standard library headers. This can lead to unnecessary code bloat and slower compilation times. We should include only the required header files.

2. **Avoid using `using namespace std`**: The code uses the `using namespace std` directive, which brings all identifiers from the `std` namespace into the global namespace. This can lead to naming conflicts and make the code harder to understand. It's better to explicitly specify the namespaces for the required identifiers.

3. **Avoid using macros**: The code uses several macros, such as `FastIO`, `debug`, and others. Macros can be error-prone and make the code harder to debug and maintain. It's better to use inline functions or constants instead of macros.

4. **Avoid using `typedef` for standard types**: The code uses `typedef` to define aliases for standard types like `long long` and `vector`. This can make the code less readable and harder to understand. It's better to use the standard type names directly.

5. **Avoid unnecessary function overloading**: The code defines two functions `rev(v)` with the same name. This can lead to confusion and potential bugs. It's better to use different names or use template functions.

6. **Avoid redundant code**: The code has redundant code blocks, such as the repeated `rev(v)` function and unused `asche` debug statement. These should be removed to improve code clarity.

7. **Avoid unnecessary memory allocation**: The code uses a 2D array `dp` of size `maxn x 3` to store dynamic programming results. However, only a small portion of this array is actually used. We can optimize memory usage by reducing the size of the array.

8. **Optimize the dynamic programming algorithm**: The code uses a recursive approach to solve the dynamic programming problem. However, this approach may lead to redundant computations and exponential time complexity. We can optimize the algorithm by using an iterative bottom-up approach instead.
