Code Analysis:
- The code represents a dynamic programming solution to a graph problem.
- The program uses a 4-dimensional array `f` to store the optimal values.
- The program initializes the `c` array with a large value (`INF`) to represent that there is no edge between two vertices.
- The program then reads the input edges and their weights into the `c` array.
- The program initializes the `f` array with a large value (`INF`) to represent that there is no path between two vertices.
- The program sets the base case values for `f` where `k = 1` (i.e., the minimum distance between two vertices when there is only one intermediate vertex).
- The program then calculates the minimum distance between two vertices for different values of `k` (number of intermediate vertices) using the dynamic programming approach.
- Finally, the program finds the minimum distance among all pairs of vertices with `p` intermediate vertices.

Potential optimizations:
1. Use a more efficient data structure for representing the graph, such as an adjacency list or a sparse matrix.
2. Avoid redundant computations by storing intermediate results in variables instead of recomputing them multiple times.
3. Optimize the loops and nested loops to reduce the number of iterations.
4. Utilize compiler optimizations and pragmas to hint the compiler to optimize the code.
5. Consider using a more appropriate data type for the `c` array if the weights can be represented by smaller values.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Replace the 2-dimensional array `c` with a more memory-efficient data structure, such as an adjacency list.
   - The adjacency list can be implemented using a vector of pairs, where the first element of the pair represents the adjacent vertex and the second element represents the weight of the edge.
   - This change will reduce the memory usage as the size of the adjacency list will be proportional to the number of edges instead of the number of vertices squared.
   - Additionally, it will improve the time complexity for accessing the adjacent vertices of a vertex.
2. Optimize the loop in the main function that initializes the `c` array.
   - Instead of setting all elements of `c` to `INF`, only set the elements corresponding to the edges to `INF`.
   - This change will reduce unnecessary assignments and improve the initialization time.
3. Use variables to store intermediate results instead of recomputing them multiple times.
   - For example, instead of recomputing `f[i][j][k - 1][0]` and `f[i][j][k - 1][1]` multiple times, store them in variables before the loop.
   - This change will reduce redundant computations and improve the performance.
4. Optimize the loops in the nested loops that calculate the minimum distance between two vertices.
   - Instead of iterating over all i2 and j2 values, optimize the loops by iterating only over the necessary range.
   - This change will reduce the number of iterations and improve the performance.
5. Utilize compiler optimizations and pragmas to hint the compiler to optimize the code.
   - Add compiler-specific optimization flags or pragmas to enable compiler optimizations.
   - This change will allow the compiler to apply various optimizations, such as loop unrolling or vectorization, to improve the performance.
