Upon analyzing the given code, I have identified the following potential optimizations:

1. Optimization of the `tab` vector:
   - The `tab` vector is currently initialized with a size of `10 * d + d` and all elements are set to `false`.
   - However, we only need to set the elements at indices `k % 10 == d` and `(k / 10) == d` to `true`.
   - We can optimize this by initializing the `tab` vector with a size of `10 * d + d` and setting only the necessary elements to `true`.

2. Optimization of the nested loops:
   - The nested loops in the code are currently used to update the `tab` vector based on certain conditions.
   - However, these nested loops can be optimized by reducing the number of iterations and unnecessary checks.
   - We can achieve this by iterating only up to `sz(tab)` and eliminating the inner loops when unnecessary.

3. Use of `reserve()` for vector:
   - The `tab` vector is resized multiple times during the execution of the program.
   - Resizing a vector can be an expensive operation, especially if it involves copying elements.
   - We can optimize this by using the `reserve()` function to pre-allocate memory for the vector based on the expected size.

4. Avoid unnecessary checks:
   - The condition `ak >= sz(tab)` is checked for each input value `ak` in the loop.
   - However, this condition can be avoided by pre-computing the maximum possible value of `ak` based on the size of the `tab` vector.

Based on these optimizations, I will now provide the optimized code:
