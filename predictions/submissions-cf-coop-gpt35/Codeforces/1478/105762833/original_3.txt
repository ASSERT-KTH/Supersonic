Code Analysis:

1. The code includes unnecessary headers like `<bits/stdc++.h>` and `_USE_MATH_DEFINES`.

2. The code uses macros like `forn` and `all` which can be replaced with regular for loops and `begin` and `end` functions respectively.

3. The code defines a template function `log_c` and a function `sz` which are not used in the code.

4. The code uses a nested loop to compute values for the `tab` vector, which can be improved.

5. The code uses a nested loop to check if `ak` is a valid index in the `tab` vector, which can be optimized.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Remove unnecessary headers: Remove the line `#define _USE_MATH_DEFINES` as it is not used in the code. Replace the include directive `<bits/stdc++.h>` with specific headers that are required by the code.

2. Replace macros with regular for loops and functions: Replace the macros `forn` and `all` with regular for loops and `begin` and `end` functions respectively. This will improve code readability and maintainability.

3. Remove unused functions: Remove the template function `log_c` and the function `sz` as they are not used in the code.

4. Optimize computation of `tab` vector: Instead of using a nested loop to compute the values for the `tab` vector, we can use a single loop. We can initialize `tab` with `false` values and then update the corresponding indices based on the conditions. This will reduce the number of iterations and improve performance.

5. Optimize checking of `ak` index in `tab` vector: Instead of using a nested loop to check if `ak` is a valid index in the `tab` vector, we can check if `ak` is greater than or equal to the size of `tab` or if `tab[ak]` is true. This will eliminate the need for the nested loop and improve performance.

Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. Remove unnecessary headers:
   - Remove the line `#define _USE_MATH_DEFINES`.
   - Replace the include directive `<bits/stdc++.h>` with specific headers that are required by the code. For example, if the code uses functions from the `iostream` and `vector` headers, include only those headers.

2. Replace macros with regular for loops and functions:
   - Replace the `forn` macro with a regular for loop. For example, replace `forn(k, sz(tab))` with `for (int k = 0; k < sz(tab); ++k)`.
   - Replace the `all` macro with the `begin` and `end` functions. For example, replace `all(c)` with `begin(c)` and `end(c)`.

3. Remove unused functions:
   - Remove the template function `log_c` and the function `sz` as they are not used in the code.

4. Optimize computation of `tab` vector:
   - Replace the nested loops with a single loop to compute the values for the `tab` vector.
   - Initialize `tab` with `false` values.
   - Update the corresponding indices in `tab` based on the conditions. For example, instead of checking if `(k % 10 == d || (k / 10) == d)`, update `tab[k] = true`.

5. Optimize checking of `ak` index in `tab` vector:
   - Replace the nested loop with a single check.
   - Check if `ak` is greater than or equal to the size of `tab` or if `tab[ak]` is true. For example, replace `(ak >= sz(tab) || tab[ak])` with `(ak >= sz(tab) || tab[ak]) ? "YES" : "NO"`.

Optimized Code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

const std::string eol = "\n";

void solve() {
  int n, d;
  cin >> n >> d;
  vector<bool> tab(10 * d + d, false);
  for (int k = 0; k < tab.size(); ++k) {
    tab[k] = k % 10 == d || (k / 10) == d;
  }
  for (int k = 0; k < n; ++k) {
    int ak;
    cin >> ak;
    cout << (ak >= tab.size() || tab[ak] ? "YES" : "NO") << eol;
  }
}

int main() {
  std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(nullptr);
  int test_sample_count;
  cin >> test_sample_count;
  while (test_sample_count--) {
    solve();
  }
  return 0;
}
```

The optimized code removes unnecessary headers, replaces macros with regular for loops and functions, removes unused functions, optimizes the computation of the `tab` vector, and optimizes the checking of the `ak` index in the `tab` vector. The changes are minimal yet effective, preserving the functionality and output of the original code.
