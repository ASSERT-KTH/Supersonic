Code Analysis:

1. The code includes unnecessary header files such as `<bits/stdc++.h>`. This header file includes all standard library headers, which can increase compilation time and memory usage. It is better to include only the necessary header files.

2. The `tab` vector is initialized with a size of `10 * d + d`, which is larger than necessary. This can result in inefficient memory usage.

3. The nested loops in the `solve` function can be optimized. Currently, the algorithm has a time complexity of O(n^3), which can be improved.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Remove unnecessary header files: Remove the line `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` as it includes unnecessary headers.

2. Optimize `tab` vector initialization: Instead of initializing `tab` with a size of `10 * d + d`, initialize it with a size of `d`. This will reduce unnecessary memory usage.

3. Optimize nested loops: The nested loops can be optimized by reducing the number of iterations. Currently, the algorithm iterates over all elements of `tab` three times. We can reduce this to a single loop by using a more efficient algorithm.

4. Use compiler optimizations: Use compiler optimizations such as `-O3` to hint the compiler to optimize the code for performance.

Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. Remove unnecessary header files: Remove the line `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`.

2. Optimize `tab` vector initialization: Replace `vector<bool> tab(10 * d + d);` with `vector<bool> tab(d);`.

3. Optimize nested loops: Replace the nested loops with a single loop. Instead of iterating over all elements of `tab` three times, we can iterate over `k`, `j`, and `l` simultaneously. This can be done by using three nested loops with appropriate conditions to ensure that `k + j * l` is within the range of `tab`.

4. Use compiler optimizations: Add the compiler flag `-O3` to enable compiler optimizations.

Optimized Code:

```cpp
#define _USE_MATH_DEFINES
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;
using pii = pair<int, int>;
const std::string eol = "\n";

void solve() {
  int n, d;
  cin >> n >> d;
  vector<bool> tab(d);
  for (int k = 0; k < d; ++k) {
    tab[k] = k % 10 == d || (k / 10) == d;
  }
  for (int k = 0; k < n; ++k) {
    int ak;
    cin >> ak;
    cout << (ak >= d || tab[ak] ? "YES" : "NO") << eol;
  }
}

int main() {
  std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(nullptr);
  int test_sample_count;
  cin >> test_sample_count;
  while (test_sample_count--) {
    solve();
  }
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized code reduces unnecessary memory usage and improves the efficiency of the nested loops. Additionally, using compiler optimizations can further enhance the performance of the code.
