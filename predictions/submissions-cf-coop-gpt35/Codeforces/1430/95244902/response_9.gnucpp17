The given code is a C++ program that takes an integer input `t` and performs a series of computations based on that input. The program calculates and prints a series of numbers based on the given input. However, the code contains several areas for potential optimization. Let's analyze the code and propose optimizations step by step.

1. Remove unnecessary includes:
   - The line `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` includes all the standard C++ libraries, which is not recommended because it increases compilation time and can lead to name conflicts. We should only include the necessary libraries for the program.

2. Remove unnecessary macros:
   - The macros defined in the code (`speed()`, `file()`, `rep()`, `rep1()`, `trace()`, etc.) are not used in the program. We should remove them to reduce code complexity and increase readability.

3. Remove unnecessary typedefs:
   - The typedefs defined in the code (`ll`, `vi`, `mi`, `pll`, `vll`, `st`, `sc`) are not used in the program. We should remove them to reduce code complexity and increase readability.

4. Replace `endl` with `"\n"`:
   - The `endl` manipulator in the code flushes the output buffer, which can be an expensive operation. We should replace it with `"\n"` to improve performance.

5. Replace `cout` with `printf`:
   - The code uses `cout` for output, which can be slower than using `printf` for formatted output. We should replace `cout` with `printf` to improve performance.

6. Remove unnecessary calculations:
   - The code performs unnecessary calculations for the variable `x` in the loop. We can simplify the calculations to improve performance.

7. Optimize the loop:
   - The loop that starts from `a - 2` and goes to `1` can be optimized by calculating the value of `x` in each iteration instead of using the previous value. This can reduce the number of calculations and improve performance.

8. Optimize power function:
   - The power function `power(T a, T b)` can be optimized by using the binary exponentiation algorithm, which reduces the number of multiplications required to calculate the power.
