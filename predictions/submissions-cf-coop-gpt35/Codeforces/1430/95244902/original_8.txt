The given code appears to solve a problem involving calculations and printing of numbers. However, there are several areas of potential improvement for efficiency:

1. Unnecessary includes: The code includes the entire standard library, which can lead to slower compile times. It is better to include only the necessary headers.

2. Unused code: The code includes several macros and functions that are not used in the main program. These can be removed to improve code readability and reduce compile time.

3. Redundant calculations: The code performs some calculations that could be simplified or optimized. For example, the calculation of `x` can be simplified to `(a + a - 1) / 2` instead of `(a + (a - 1) + 1) / 2`.

4. Unnecessary memory usage: The code uses a vector and a map, but does not seem to utilize them effectively. These data structures can be replaced with simpler alternatives to reduce memory usage.

5. Code comments: The code lacks comments, making it difficult to understand the purpose and functionality of each section. Adding relevant comments will improve code readability and maintainability.

Based on these observations, the following optimization strategy can be formulated:

1. Remove unnecessary includes, macros, and functions.
2. Simplify calculations to reduce redundant operations.
3. Replace unnecessary data structures with simpler alternatives.
4. Add comments to improve code readability.

Now, let's go through each step in detail and provide the optimized code.
