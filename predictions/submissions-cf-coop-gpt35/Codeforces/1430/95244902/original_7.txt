The given code appears to be a C++ program that solves a specific problem. The program takes an input value `t` and then for each test case, it takes an input value `a` and performs some calculations to generate a specific pattern of output.

To optimize this code, we will focus on the following aspects:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The code includes the entire `bits/stdc++.h` header, which is not recommended as it includes a large number of unnecessary standard library headers. We should include only the necessary headers.

2. Remove unnecessary macros: The code defines several macros that are not used in the program. We should remove these macros to improve code readability.

3. Avoid repetitive calculations: The code performs some repetitive calculations inside the loop. We can optimize these calculations to avoid redundant computations.

4. Avoid unnecessary I/O operations: The code uses `cin` and `cout` for input and output operations. These operations can be slow compared to other methods, such as using `scanf` and `printf`. We can modify the code to use these faster I/O operations.

5. Remove redundant variables: The code defines some variables that are not used. We should remove these variables to reduce memory usage.

Now, let's proceed with the optimization steps to improve the efficiency of the given code.
