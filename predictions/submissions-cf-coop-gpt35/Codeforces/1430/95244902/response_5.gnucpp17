Analysis:
The given code seems to implement a solution to a specific problem, but without a clear problem statement, it is difficult to fully understand the purpose of the code. However, we can still analyze the code for potential performance bottlenecks and areas that can be optimized.

1. The code includes unnecessary header files: `<bits/stdc++.h>` includes a large number of header files, which can slow down the compilation process. It is recommended to include only the necessary header files.

2. The code includes a large number of macros: While macros can help in code readability and reduce code duplication, they can also introduce unnecessary function calls and increase code size. It is recommended to use inline functions instead of macros, as they offer better type safety and can be optimized by the compiler.

3. The code uses `std::endl` instead of `'\n'`: `std::endl` flushes the output stream, which can decrease performance. It is recommended to use the newline character `'\n'` instead, unless explicit flushing is required.

4. The code uses `std::endl` after each output statement: Flushing the output stream after every output operation can significantly impact performance. It is recommended to minimize the number of flushes by using `'\n'` and flushing the stream only when necessary.

5. The code uses `std::cin` and `std::cout` for input and output: These stream objects are slower than other input/output methods, such as `scanf` and `printf`. It is recommended to use these faster methods for improved performance.

6. The code uses `std::vector` for storing and printing elements: While `std::vector` is a convenient container, it incurs overhead due to dynamic memory allocation and deallocation. It is recommended to use fixed-size arrays or other data structures whenever possible for better performance.

7. The code uses division and modulo operations: Division and modulo operations can be computationally expensive, especially on large numbers. It is recommended to minimize the usage of these operations, especially within loops, and try to replace them with faster alternatives whenever possible.

8. The code uses a while loop: The while loop is used to iterate over the value of `b` in the `power` function. This can be replaced with a more efficient method, such as using bitwise operations, to improve performance.

Optimization Strategy:
Based on the analysis, we can formulate the following optimization strategy:

1. Remove unnecessary header files: Remove the unnecessary header files included in the code.

2. Replace macros with inline functions: Replace the macros with inline functions for better type safety and potential compiler optimizations.

3. Replace `std::endl` with `'\n'`: Replace all instances of `std::endl` with the newline character `'\n'` to avoid unnecessary flushing of the output stream.

4. Minimize output stream flushes: Minimize the number of output stream flushes by using `'\n'` instead of `std::endl`, and flush the stream only when necessary.

5. Use faster input/output methods: Replace the usage of `std::cin` and `std::cout` with faster input/output methods, such as `scanf` and `printf`.

6. Replace `std::vector` with fixed-size arrays: Replace the usage of `std::vector` with fixed-size arrays or other data structures whenever possible to reduce dynamic memory allocation overhead.

7. Minimize division and modulo operations: Minimize the usage of division and modulo operations, especially within loops, and try to replace them with faster alternatives whenever possible.

8. Optimize the `power` function: Replace the while loop in the `power` function with a more efficient method, such as using bitwise operations, to improve performance.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Remove unnecessary header files: Remove the line `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` as it includes unnecessary header files.

2. Replace macros with inline functions: Replace the macros `speed()`, `file()`, `rep()`, `rep1()`, `trace()`, `mem()`, `sl()`, `pb()`, `pf()`, `mp()`, `F`, `S`, `pi`, `en`, `power()`, `print()`, `gcd()`, and `lcm()` with inline functions. For example, replace `#define speed() ios::sync_with_stdio(0); cin.tie(0);` with `inline void speed() { ios::sync_with_stdio(0); cin.tie(0); }`.

3. Replace `std::endl` with `'\n'`: Replace all instances of `std::endl` with the newline character `'\n'`.

4. Minimize output stream flushes: Replace `std::endl` with `'\n'` after each output statement, and add `std::cout.flush()` after the while loop in the main function to flush the output stream.

5. Use faster input/output methods: Replace `std::cin` and `std::cout` with faster input/output methods, such as `scanf` and `printf`. Update the input/output statements accordingly.

6. Replace `std::vector` with fixed-size arrays: Replace the usage of `std::vector` with fixed-size arrays or other data structures whenever possible. For example, replace `typedef vector<ll> vi;` with `typedef array<ll, mx> vi;`.

7. Minimize division and modulo operations: Minimize the usage of division and modulo operations, especially within loops. For example, replace `(a + (a - 1) + 1) / 2` with `(a + a - 1 + 1) >> 1` to perform division by 2 using bitwise right shift.
