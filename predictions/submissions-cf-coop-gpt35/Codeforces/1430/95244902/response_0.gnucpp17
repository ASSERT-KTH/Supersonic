The given code represents a program that takes an integer input `t` and then for `t` test cases, it takes an integer input `a` and performs a series of calculations and outputs specific numbers. The code seems to implement a mathematical pattern or algorithm.

To optimize this code, we will focus on the following aspects:
1. Remove unnecessary includes and macros.
2. Remove unnecessary data structures and variables.
3. Simplify mathematical calculations.
4. Avoid repetitive calculations.
5. Remove unnecessary I/O operations.
6. Optimize loops and conditions.

Let's proceed with the optimization steps one by one.

Step 1: Remove unnecessary includes and macros.
The code includes unnecessary headers and macros that are not used in the given program. We can remove them to simplify the code. The optimized code will not have any unnecessary includes or macros.

Step 2: Remove unnecessary data structures and variables.
The code defines several typedefs and data structures that are not used in the program. We can remove them to simplify the code. The optimized code will not have any unused typedefs or data structures.

Step 3: Simplify mathematical calculations.
The code contains some complex mathematical calculations that can be simplified to improve efficiency. Specifically, the calculation `x = (a + (a - 1) + 1) / 2` can be simplified to `x = a`.

Step 4: Avoid repetitive calculations.
The code calculates `(x + i + 1) / 2` in each iteration of the loop. We can avoid this repetitive calculation by calculating it once before the loop and then reusing the value in each iteration.

Step 5: Remove unnecessary I/O operations.
The code uses `cout` to print the number 2 in each iteration of the loop. We can move this outside the loop to avoid redundant I/O operations.

Step 6: Optimize loops and conditions.
The code uses a `while` loop to iterate `t` times. We can change it to a `for` loop to simplify the code. Also, the condition `i >= 1` in the inner loop can be changed to `i > 0` to avoid unnecessary iterations.
