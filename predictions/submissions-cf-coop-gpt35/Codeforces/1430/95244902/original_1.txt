Upon analyzing the given code, I have identified the following potential areas for optimization:

1. Unnecessary includes: The code includes the entire `bits/stdc++.h` header, which is a non-standard header and includes a large number of standard library headers. This can lead to increased compilation time and unnecessary memory usage. It is better to include only the required standard library headers.

2. Macro functions: The code uses several macro functions such as `speed()`, `file()`, `rep()`, `rep1()`, `trace()`, `mem()`, `sl()`, `pb()`, `pf()`, `mp()`, etc. While these macros might provide some convenience, they can also result in increased code size and decreased readability. It is better to replace these macros with regular functions or inline code.

3. Unnecessary data structures and functions: The code defines several data structures (`typedef`) and functions (`power()`, `print()`, `gcd()`, `lcm()`) that are not used in the main program. These unnecessary definitions can be removed to reduce memory usage.

4. Redundant calculations: The code performs several redundant calculations, such as `(a + (a - 1) + 1) / 2` and `(x + i + 1) / 2`, which can be simplified to `a` and `x`, respectively.

5. Inefficient loop: The loop `for (i = a - 2; i >= 1; i--)` can be optimized by starting from `i = 1` and incrementing `i` in each iteration. This eliminates the need for the `>=` comparison and improves loop performance.

6. Use of `endl`: The code uses `endl` to end each line of output. However, `endl` flushes the output stream, which can be inefficient. It is better to use `'\n'` instead, which only inserts a newline character.

Based on these observations, I will now provide a step-by-step optimization strategy and the corresponding optimized code.
