The given code appears to be a C++ program that solves a problem involving some mathematical calculations. However, the code includes a number of unnecessary macros and imports, making it difficult to analyze and optimize. 

To optimize this code, we will focus on the following aspects:
1. Remove unnecessary macros and imports.
2. Optimize the mathematical calculations to reduce redundant computations.
3. Streamline the loop structure to improve efficiency.
4. Remove unused variables and simplify the code.

Let's proceed with the step-by-step explanation and optimization of the code.
