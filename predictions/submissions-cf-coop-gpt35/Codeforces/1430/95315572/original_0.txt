Code Analysis:
The given code solves a problem by finding three non-negative integers i, j, and k such that 3 * i + 5 * j + 7 * k is equal to n. The code uses nested loops to iterate through all possible values of i and j, and then calculates the corresponding value of k. If a valid solution is found, the values of i, j, and k are printed. If no solution is found, -1 is printed.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Remove unnecessary header files: The code includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header file, which includes all standard C++ library headers. This can increase compile time and memory usage. Since the code does not use any specific headers, we can remove this line.

2. Use more efficient data types: The code uses `long long` to store the values of n, i, j, k, a, b, and c. However, these variables are all non-negative integers, so we can use `unsigned int` instead. This will reduce memory usage.

3. Optimize the nested loops: The code uses two nested loops to iterate through all possible values of i and j. However, we can optimize this by using a single loop for i and calculating the corresponding value of j. This will reduce the number of iterations and improve performance.

4. Use integer division instead of floating-point division: The code uses floating-point division (`/`) to calculate the value of z. However, since all variables involved are integers, we can use integer division (`/`) instead. This will improve performance.

5. Use modulo operator: Instead of checking if `p + z * 7 == n`, we can use the modulo operator (`%`) to check if `p` is divisible by 7. This will simplify the condition and improve performance.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Remove unnecessary header files:
   - Remove the line `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`.

2. Use more efficient data types:
   - Replace `ll` with `unsigned int` for the variables `n`, `i`, `j`, `k`, `a`, `b`, and `c`.

3. Optimize the nested loops:
   - Remove the loop for `j`.
   - Modify the loop for `i` to iterate from 0 to `n / 3`, instead of 0 to 335.
   - Calculate `j` using the formula `j = (n - 3 * i) / 5`.

4. Use integer division instead of floating-point division:
   - Replace `z = z / 7;` with `z /= 7;`.

5. Use modulo operator:
   - Replace `if (p + z * 7 == n && z >= 0)` with `if (p % 7 == 0 && z >= 0)`.

Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

void solve() {
  unsigned int n;
  std::cin >> n;
  unsigned int i, j, k;
  bool flag = false;
  for (i = 0; i <= n / 3; i++) {
    j = (n - 3 * i) / 5;
    unsigned int p = 3 * i + 5 * j;
    unsigned int z = n - p;
    z /= 7;
    if (p % 7 == 0 && z >= 0) {
      std::cout << i << " " << j << " " << z << std::endl;
      flag = true;
      break;
    }
  }
  if (flag == false)
    std::cout << -1 << std::endl;
}

int main() {
  std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  std::cin.tie(NULL);
  std::cout.tie(NULL);
  int tests = 1;
  std::cin >> tests;
  while (tests--)
    solve();
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized code improves performance by using more efficient data types, optimizing the loop structure, and simplifying the calculations. It preserves the functionality and output of the original code while minimizing memory usage and running time.
