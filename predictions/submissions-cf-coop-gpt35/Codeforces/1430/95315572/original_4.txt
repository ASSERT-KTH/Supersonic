The provided code aims to solve a problem by finding the values of three variables (`i`, `j`, and `z`) that satisfy a given equation. The code uses nested loops to iterate through all possible values of `i` and `j` and calculates `p` and `z` based on these values. It then checks if the equation is satisfied and prints the values if it is.

However, there are several areas of this code that can be optimized:

1. Loop Bounds: The loop bounds for `i` and `j` are hardcoded as `335` and `210`, respectively. These bounds are derived from the equation `3 * i + 5 * j + 7 * z = n`, with `i`, `j`, and `z` being non-negative integers. However, the code does not handle cases where `n` is less than `7`, which leads to unnecessary iterations. To optimize this, we can calculate the upper bounds for `i` and `j` dynamically based on the value of `n`.

2. Division and Modulo: The code uses division and modulo operations to calculate `z` and check if the equation is satisfied. These operations can be computationally expensive, especially when dealing with large numbers. Instead of dividing `z` by `7`, we can use the bitwise right shift operator (`>>`) to divide by powers of 2, which is more efficient. Additionally, we can replace the modulo operation with a simple comparison (`p == n`) to check if the equation is satisfied.

3. Flag Variable: The `flag` variable is used to determine if a solution is found and to break out of the nested loops. However, this can be simplified by using a return statement to exit the function when a solution is found.

4. Unnecessary Macros: The code includes unnecessary macros for `ll` (long long), `endl`, and `MOD`. These macros can be removed as they are not used in the code.

With these optimizations in mind, let's proceed to rewrite the code and explain each optimization step in detail.
