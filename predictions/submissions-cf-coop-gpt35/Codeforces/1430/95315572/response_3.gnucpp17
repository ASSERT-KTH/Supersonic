Analysis:
- The code reads an integer `n` and tries to find three non-negative integers `i`, `j`, and `z` such that `3*i + 5*j + 7*z = n`.
- The code uses nested loops to iterate over all possible values of `i` and `j`, and then calculates `z` based on the value of `n` and the current values of `i` and `j`.
- If a valid solution is found, it is printed, otherwise -1 is printed.

Potential optimizations:
1. Loop bounds: The loops run from 0 to specific values. We can optimize this by calculating the upper bounds based on `n` and the maximum possible values of `i` and `j` that satisfy the equation.
2. Division and modulo operations: The code uses division and modulo operations to calculate `z`. Instead, we can use subtraction and multiplication to avoid these expensive operations.
3. Early termination: Once a solution is found, there is no need to continue searching for more solutions. We can break out of the loops as soon as a valid solution is found.
4. Output buffering: The code uses `endl` to flush the output stream after each solution is printed. This can be quite inefficient. We can use a newline character `'\n'` instead and use `cout.sync_with_stdio(false)` to disable synchronization between C and C++ standard streams, improving the performance of output operations.

Optimization strategy:
1. Calculate the upper bounds for the loops based on `n` and the maximum possible values of `i` and `j` that satisfy the equation.
2. Replace the division and modulo operations with subtraction and multiplication to calculate `z`.
3. Add a flag variable to track if a valid solution is found and break out of the loops once a solution is found.
4. Replace `endl` with `'\n'` and add `cout.sync_with_stdio(false)` in the `main` function.

Step-by-step explanation:
1. Calculate the upper bounds for the loops:
   - The maximum value of `i` can be calculated as `n / 3`, since `3 * i` is the largest multiple of 3 that is less than or equal to `n`.
   - The maximum value of `j` can be calculated as `n / 5`, since `5 * j` is the largest multiple of 5 that is less than or equal to `n`.
   - Modify the loop bounds accordingly.

2. Replace the division and modulo operations with subtraction and multiplication to calculate `z`:
   - Instead of dividing `z` by 7 using `z = z / 7`, we can subtract `p` from `n` and then multiply the result by the inverse of 7 (`1/7`) using `z = (n - p) * 7`.
   - Modify the code accordingly.

3. Add a flag variable to track if a valid solution is found and break out of the loops once a solution is found:
   - Declare a boolean flag variable `found` and initialize it as false.
   - Set `found` to true when a valid solution is found.
   - Add a condition to break out of the loops if `found` is true.
   - Modify the code accordingly.

4. Replace `endl` with `'\n'` and add `cout.sync_with_stdio(false)` in the `main` function:
   - Replace `endl` with `'\n'` to improve the performance of output operations.
   - Add `cout.sync_with_stdio(false)` to disable synchronization between C and C++ standard streams, improving the performance of output operations.
   - Modify the code accordingly.
