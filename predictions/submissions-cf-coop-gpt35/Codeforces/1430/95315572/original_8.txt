The given code calculates and prints the values of three variables `i`, `j`, and `z` such that `3*i + 5*j + 7*z` is equal to the given input `n`. The code uses nested loops to iterate over all possible values of `i` and `j` and calculates `z` using the formula `z = (n - 3*i - 5*j) / 7`. If a valid solution is found, it prints `i`, `j`, and `z`. If no solution is found, it prints -1.

To optimize this code, we can make the following improvements:

1. Avoid unnecessary calculations: The current code calculates `z` for every pair of `i` and `j` values, even if `z` is negative. We can avoid these unnecessary calculations by modifying the inner loop to iterate until `z` becomes negative.

2. Eliminate floating point division: The code uses floating point division (`/`) to calculate `z`. Instead, we can use integer division (`/`) to perform the same calculation, which is faster.

3. Use integer arithmetic: The code uses `ll` (long long) data type for all variables, even though some variables can be represented by smaller data types, such as `int` or `short`. We can optimize memory usage by using appropriate data types based on the range of values the variables can take.

4. Remove unnecessary header files: The code includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header file, which is not required. We can include only the necessary header files, such as `<iostream>` and `<vector>`.

5. Avoid using `using namespace std`: The code uses the `using namespace std` directive, which brings all names from the `std` namespace into the global namespace. This can lead to naming conflicts and is generally considered bad practice. We can remove this directive and use the `std::` prefix to access names from the `std` namespace.

Taking these optimizations into account, here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

void solve() {
  int n;
  std::cin >> n;

  int i, j;

  bool flag = false;
  for (i = 0; i <= 335; i++) {
    for (j = 0; j <= 210; j++) {
      int p = 3 * i + 5 * j;
      int z = (n - p) / 7;
      if (p + z * 7 == n && z >= 0) {
        std::cout << i << " " << j << " " << z << std::endl;
        flag = true;
        break;
      }
      if (z < 0)
        break;
    }
    if (flag)
      break;
  }

  if (!flag)
    std::cout << -1 << std::endl;
}

int main() {
  std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  std::cin.tie(NULL);
  std::cout.tie(NULL);

  int tests = 1;
  std::cin >> tests;

  while (tests--)
    solve();

  return 0;
}
```

These optimizations reduce unnecessary calculations, use more appropriate data types, and improve the readability of the code. The changes made are minimal, preserving the functionality and output of the original code.
