This code calculates the values of three variables `i`, `j`, and `z` such that `3*i + 5*j + 7*z` is equal to a given number `n`. It then prints the values of `i`, `j`, and `z` if they exist, otherwise it prints `-1`.

Here are some possible optimizations for this code:

1. Remove unnecessary include: The code includes the entire `bits/stdc++.h` header, which is not recommended as it slows down the compilation process. Instead, include only the necessary headers.

2. Remove unnecessary `endl`: The `endl` manipulator flushes the output stream, which can be expensive. Since the code is using `cout` for printing, it is more efficient to use the newline character `'\n'` instead of `endl`.

3. Minimize the number of variables: The variables `a`, `b`, and `c` are declared but not used. Removing them can reduce memory usage.

4. Avoid unnecessary calculations: The variable `z` is calculated as `z = n - p` and then immediately divided by 7. Instead, we can calculate `z` directly as `z = (n - p) / 7`.

5. Use more efficient loop bounds: The outer loop runs from 0 to 335, and the inner loop runs from 0 to 210. These loop bounds are chosen based on the maximum possible values of `i` and `j` such that `3*i + 5*j` is less than or equal to `n`. However, we can optimize this by calculating the maximum values of `i` and `j` based on `n` itself. This will significantly reduce the number of iterations in the loops.

6. Break out of both loops when a solution is found: Currently, the code breaks out of the inner loop when a solution is found, but it continues with the next value of `i`. Instead, we can break out of both loops when a solution is found, saving unnecessary iterations.

7. Use a more efficient algorithm: The current algorithm uses a brute-force approach by checking all possible values of `i` and `j`. This can be optimized by using a more efficient algorithm to find the values of `i` and `j` such that `3*i + 5*j` is equal to `n`. One possible approach is to use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to solve the Diophantine equation `3*i + 5*j = n`. This will reduce the time complexity of the algorithm.

Based on these optimizations, here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

void solve() {
    int n;
    std::cin >> n;

    int i_max = n / 3; // Calculate maximum value of i based on n
    int j_max = n / 5; // Calculate maximum value of j based on n

    bool flag = false;
    for (int i = 0; i <= i_max; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j <= j_max; j++) {
            int p = 3 * i + 5 * j;
            int z = (n - p) / 7;
            if (p + z * 7 == n && z >= 0) {
                std::cout << i << " " << j << " " << z << '\n';
                flag = true;
                break;
            }
        }
        if (flag)
            break;
    }

    if (!flag)
        std::cout << -1 << '\n';
}

int main() {
    std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    std::cin.tie(NULL);
    std::cout.tie(NULL);

    int tests;
    std::cin >> tests;
    while (tests--)
        solve();

    return 0;
}
```

These optimizations aim to improve the running time and memory usage of the original code while preserving its functionality and output.
