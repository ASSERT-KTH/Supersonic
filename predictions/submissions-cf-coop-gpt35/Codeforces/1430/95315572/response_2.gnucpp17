The given code finds three non-negative integers i, j, and z such that 3i + 5j + 7z = n. If such integers exist, it prints their values; otherwise, it prints -1.

Let's analyze the code for potential performance bottlenecks and inefficient memory usage:

1. The code uses the `bits/stdc++.h` header file, which includes all standard library headers. This can result in slower compile times and can include unnecessary headers that are not required for this program.

2. The code uses `std::endl` to end each line. However, `std::endl` flushes the output buffer, which can significantly impact performance. It is more efficient to use the newline character `'\n'` instead.

3. The code uses a nested loop to iterate over all possible values of `i` and `j`. However, the loop limits are arbitrary and not based on the problem constraints. This can lead to unnecessary iterations and result in slower execution.

4. The code calculates `z` as `z = (n - p) / 7` in each iteration of the inner loop. However, this calculation can be simplified to `z = (n - p) / 7` outside the inner loop since it does not depend on `i` or `j`.

5. The code checks if `p + z * 7 == n` to verify if a valid solution is found. However, this check can be avoided by calculating `z` as `z = (n - p) / 7` and checking if `(n - p) % 7 == 0` instead.

6. The code uses a flag variable to break out of the outer loop when a solution is found. However, we can improve the code by using a single loop and returning early when a solution is found.

Based on these observations, here is an optimization strategy:

1. Replace the `bits/stdc++.h` header with the specific headers required for this program (`iostream` and `ios_base`).

2. Replace `std::endl` with `'\n'` to avoid unnecessary buffer flushing.

3. Update the loop limits to reflect the problem constraints. Since `i` and `j` are non-negative integers, we can use `n/3` and `n/5` as the limits respectively. This reduces the number of iterations.

4. Calculate `z` as `z = (n - p) / 7` outside the inner loop.

5. Use `(n - p) % 7 == 0` as the condition to check if a valid solution is found.

6. Remove the flag variable and break statements. Use a single loop and return early when a solution is found.
