The given code is a solution to a problem that involves finding three non-negative integers `i`, `j`, and `z` such that `3*i + 5*j + 7*z = n`, where `n` is a given input. The code uses nested loops to iterate over all possible values of `i` and `j` to find the corresponding value of `z`.

Upon analyzing the code, the following potential optimizations can be identified:

1. Redundant Calculation: The calculation `z = z / 7` is performed in every iteration of the inner loop. Since `z` is not modified within the loop, this calculation can be moved outside the loop to avoid redundant computation.

2. Loop Bounds: The outer loop iterates from 0 to 335, while the inner loop iterates from 0 to 210. However, the maximum possible value of `i` and `j` can be calculated by dividing `n` by 3 and 5 respectively. By using these calculated maximum values as the loop bounds, unnecessary iterations can be avoided.

3. Early Termination: Once a valid solution `(i, j, z)` is found, there is no need to continue iterating further. The code can be optimized to break out of both loops as soon as a solution is found, instead of continuing to check the remaining iterations.

4. Remove Unused Variables: The variables `a`, `b`, and `c` are declared but never used in the code. These variables can be safely removed to reduce memory usage.
