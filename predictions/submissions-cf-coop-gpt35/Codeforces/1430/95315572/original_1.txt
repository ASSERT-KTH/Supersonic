The given code finds a solution to a problem using nested loops. It iterates through all possible combinations of `i` and `j`, calculates `p` using `i` and `j`, and then calculates `z` based on `n` and `p`. It checks if `p + z * 7` is equal to `n` and if `z` is non-negative. If a valid solution is found, it prints the values of `i`, `j`, and `z`. If no solution is found, it prints -1.

Here are the potential optimizations that can be made to improve the efficiency of this code:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The code includes the entire `bits/stdc++.h` library, which includes a large number of headers. This can increase compilation time and unnecessarily bloat the code. Only include the necessary headers, such as `<iostream>` and `<cmath>`.

2. Avoid unnecessary variable declarations: The variables `a`, `b`, and `c` are declared but never used. Remove these unused variables to improve code readability.

3. Avoid unnecessary calculations: The variable `k` is declared but never used. Remove this unused variable to avoid unnecessary calculations.

4. Optimize loop limits: The outer loop iterates from 0 to 335, and the inner loop iterates from 0 to 210. These limits are hardcoded and do not depend on the input `n`. Since `n` is the input, we can optimize the loop limits to depend on `n` instead of hardcoding them. This will reduce the number of iterations and improve performance.

5. Avoid unnecessary divisions: The variable `z` is calculated as `z = n - p` and then divided by 7. Instead of performing two operations, we can calculate `z` directly as `(n - p) / 7`. This will eliminate the need for an intermediate variable and improve performance.

6. Use a more efficient loop construct: The code uses a flag variable `bool flag` to break out of the loops once a solution is found. Instead of using a flag, we can use a labeled break statement to directly break out of both loops when a solution is found. This will eliminate the need for the flag variable and improve code readability.

7. Avoid unnecessary checks: The code checks if `z` is non-negative before printing the solution. However, since `z` is calculated as `(n - p) / 7`, it will always be non-negative as long as `n` is divisible by 7. We can remove this check to simplify the code and improve performance.

8. Optimize output stream: The code uses `cout` to print the solution. However, `cout` is slower compared to `printf`. We can use `printf` instead of `cout` for faster output.

Based on these optimizations, here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

void solve() {
  int n;
  std::cin >> n;

  int i, j;
  bool foundSolution = false;

  for (i = 0; i <= n / 3; i++) {
    for (j = 0; j <= n / 5; j++) {
      int p = 3 * i + 5 * j;
      int z = (n - p) / 7;
      if (p + z * 7 == n) {
        std::printf("%d %d %d\n", i, j, z);
        foundSolution = true;
        break;
      }
    }
    if (foundSolution)
      break;
  }

  if (!foundSolution)
    std::cout << -1 << "\n";
}

int main() {
  std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  std::cin.tie(NULL);
  std::cout.tie(NULL);

  int tests = 1;
  std::cin >> tests;

  while (tests--)
    solve();

  return 0;
}
```

These optimizations reduce unnecessary calculations, improve loop limits, simplify the code, and use more efficient output methods. The overall effect is improved performance and reduced memory usage.
