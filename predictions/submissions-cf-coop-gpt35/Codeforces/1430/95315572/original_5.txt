Code Analysis:

Upon analyzing the given code, I have identified several potential areas for optimization:

1. The use of "bits/stdc++.h" header: This header includes almost all standard library headers, which can increase compilation time and unnecessary memory usage. It's better to include only the required headers.

2. The use of "using namespace std": This directive brings all the names from the std namespace into the global namespace, which can lead to naming conflicts. It's better to use the std:: prefix for standard library functions and objects.

3. Redundant variable declarations: The variables a, b, and c are declared but never used. These can be removed to improve readability.

4. Nested loops: The nested loops in the solve() function can be optimized to reduce the number of iterations. Currently, i runs from 0 to 335, and j runs from 0 to 210. By analyzing the equation p = 3 * i + 5 * j, we can see that i can only go up to n / 3 and j can only go up to (n - 3 * i) / 5. This reduces the number of iterations and improves performance.

5. Unnecessary division: The variable z is calculated as z = n - p, and then immediately divided by 7. Instead of dividing, we can directly calculate z as (n - p) / 7. This eliminates the need for an extra division operation.

6. Unnecessary check for z >= 0: Since z is calculated as (n - p) / 7, it will always be non-negative. Therefore, the check for z >= 0 is redundant and can be removed.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Replace the "bits/stdc++.h" header with the specific headers required for the program, such as <iostream>, <vector>, etc.

2. Remove the "using namespace std" directive and use the std:: prefix for standard library functions and objects.

3. Remove the unused variables: a, b, and c.

4. Optimize the nested loops in the solve() function to reduce the number of iterations. Modify the loop conditions for i and j to restrict their range based on the equation p = 3 * i + 5 * j.

5. Calculate z directly as z = (n - p) / 7 instead of dividing z after subtracting p from n.

6. Remove the check for z >= 0.

Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. Replace the "bits/stdc++.h" header with specific headers required for the program, such as <iostream>, <vector>, etc.

2. Remove the "using namespace std" directive and use the std:: prefix for standard library functions and objects.

3. Remove the unused variables: a, b, and c.

4. Optimize the nested loops in the solve() function to reduce the number of iterations. Modify the loop conditions for i and j to restrict their range based on the equation p = 3 * i + 5 * j. The new loop conditions will be i <= n / 3 and j <= (n - 3 * i) / 5.

5. Calculate z directly as z = (n - p) / 7 instead of dividing z after subtracting p from n.

6. Remove the check for z >= 0.

Optimized Code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

void solve()
{
    long long n;
    std::cin >> n;

    bool flag = false;
    for (long long i = 0; i <= n / 3; i++) {
        for (long long j = 0; j <= (n - 3 * i) / 5; j++) {
            long long p = 3 * i + 5 * j;
            long long z = (n - p) / 7;
            if (p + z * 7 == n) {
                std::cout << i << " " << j << " " << z << std::endl;
                flag = true;
                break;
            }
        }
        if (flag)
            break;
    }

    if (!flag)
        std::cout << -1 << std::endl;
}

int main()
{
    std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    std::cin.tie(NULL);
    std::cout.tie(NULL);

    int tests = 1;
    std::cin >> tests;

    while (tests--)
        solve();

    return 0;
}
```

This optimized code retains the functionality and output of the original code while improving performance by reducing unnecessary operations and loop iterations.
