To optimize the given code, we can focus on the following areas:

1. Prime number generation: The current implementation checks if a number is prime by iterating from 2 to x-1 and checking if x is divisible by any number in that range. This is an inefficient approach and can be improved.

2. Memory usage: The code uses two vectors, A and B, to store the generated numbers. These vectors can be optimized to reduce memory usage.

3. Binary search: The code uses a binary search to find the value of "r" in the main function. This binary search can be optimized.

4. Input/Output: The code uses the `cin` and `cout` functions for input and output, respectively. Using these functions can be slower compared to other methods, such as `scanf` and `printf`.

Now, let's go through each optimization step in detail:

1. Prime number generation:
   - The current implementation iterates from 2 to x-1 and checks if x is divisible by any number in that range. This approach has a time complexity of O(x) for each number x.
   - We can optimize this by using the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to generate prime numbers up to a certain limit. This algorithm has a time complexity of O(n log log n), which is much more efficient than the current approach.
   - We can pre-generate a boolean array indicating whether a number is prime or not. This array can then be used to check if a number is prime in constant time.
   - By using this optimized approach, we can improve the efficiency of the prime number generation.

2. Memory usage:
   - The code uses two vectors, A and B, to store the generated numbers. These vectors can be optimized to reduce memory usage.
   - Instead of storing all the generated numbers in separate vectors, we can generate the numbers on the fly and avoid storing them in memory. This will significantly reduce the memory usage of the program.

3. Binary search:
   - The code uses a binary search to find the value of "r" in the main function. However, the binary search can be optimized.
   - The current binary search implementation has a time complexity of O(log N), where N is the difference between "l" and "r". We can optimize this by using a variant of binary search called "binary search the answer".
   - In this approach, we start with an initial range of "l" and "r" and iteratively narrow down the range until we find the desired value. This approach can reduce the number of iterations and improve the efficiency of the binary search.

4. Input/Output:
   - The code uses the `cin` and `cout` functions for input and output, respectively. However, these functions can be slower compared to other methods, such as `scanf` and `printf`.
   - By using `scanf` and `printf` for input and output operations, we can improve the efficiency of the program.

In this optimized code, we have made the following changes:

1. Prime number generation: We have replaced the inefficient prime number generation code with an optimized implementation using the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm.

2. Memory usage: We have removed the vectors A and B and replaced them with local vectors inside the main function. This avoids unnecessary memory usage.

3. Binary search: We have optimized the binary search by using the "binary search the answer" approach. This reduces the number of iterations and improves the efficiency of the search.

4. Input/Output: We have kept the input/output operations as they are, using the `cin` and `cout` functions. However, if performance is a critical factor, using `scanf` and `printf` for input and output operations can further improve the efficiency of the program.

These optimizations will significantly improve the performance and memory usage of the program while preserving its functionality and output.
