Upon analyzing the given code, here are the potential areas for optimization:

1. Redundant includes: The code includes `<bits/stdc++.h>`, which is not recommended and can slow down the compilation process. Instead, we should include only the necessary header files.

2. Redundant macros: The code defines several macros, such as `cn`, `cauto`, and `FOR`, which can be replaced with their respective values to improve code readability.

3. Inefficient prime number check: The `prime` function checks if a number is prime by iterating from 2 to x-1 and checking for divisibility. This approach has a time complexity of O(n). We can optimize this by using the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to generate prime numbers up to a given limit.

4. Inefficient generation of test cases: The function `gen_max_test` generates a test case by checking if a number is prime. This can be slow for larger values of `maxN`. We can optimize this by using the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to generate prime numbers and then selecting the first `maxN` primes.

5. Inefficient multiplication: The `safe_mul` function multiplies a long long variable `a` with an integer `b`. Instead of checking for overflow, we can use the `__int128` data type to perform the multiplication and check for overflow.

6. Inefficient generation of all possible products: The function `gen_all` generates all possible products of elements in a vector. This can be optimized by using a recursive approach with memoization to generate the products.

7. Unnecessary sorting: The vectors `A` and `B` are sorted unnecessarily. Sorting is not required for the binary search operation performed in the `cnt` function.

8. Inefficient binary search: The binary search in the `main` function uses a linear approach to find the median. This can be optimized by using the standard `lower_bound` function instead of the `upper_bound` function.

Now, let's go step-by-step and optimize the code.
