Code Analysis:
1. The code includes numerous unnecessary header files, including `<bits/stdc++.h>`, which is not a standard C++ header file.
2. Macros are used extensively, which can lead to code that is difficult to read and maintain.
3. The code uses the `tree` container from the `__gnu_pbds` namespace, which is not a standard C++ container.
4. The `prime` function checks if a number is prime by iterating from 2 to x - 1, which is inefficient. There are more efficient algorithms for checking primality.
5. The `gen_max_test` function generates a test case by finding prime numbers, which is an inefficient approach.
6. The `safe_mul` function checks if a multiplication will overflow before performing the multiplication.
7. The `gen_all` function generates all possible products of elements from a given vector, which can be optimized.
8. The `cnt` function counts the number of elements in `A` that are less than or equal to a given value, and then uses `upper_bound` to count the number of elements in `B` that are less than or equal to `val / e`. This can be optimized.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Remove unnecessary header files and macros.
2. Replace the `tree` container with a standard C++ container if possible.
3. Use a more efficient algorithm to check primality.
4. Optimize the `gen_max_test` function to generate the test case more efficiently.
5. Optimize the `gen_all` function to generate all possible products more efficiently.
6. Optimize the `cnt` function to count the number of elements more efficiently.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Remove unnecessary header files and macros.
   - Remove the inclusion of `<bits/stdc++.h>` as it is not a standard C++ header file.
   - Remove the `cn` and `cauto` macros, as they are not necessary and can make the code harder to read.
   - Replace the `FOR` and `FORN` macros with regular for loops, as macros can sometimes lead to unexpected behavior and make the code harder to debug.
   - Remove the unnecessary macros for `endl`, `mp`, `pb`, `F`, `S`, `X`, `Y`, `CONT`, and `ARR`, as they are not used in the code.

2. Replace the `tree` container with a standard C++ container if possible.
   - The `tree` container from the `__gnu_pbds` namespace is not a standard C++ container and may not be optimized for performance. If possible, replace it with a standard C++ container such as `std::set` or `std::map`.

3. Use a more efficient algorithm to check primality.
   - The current `prime` function checks if a number is prime by iterating from 2 to x - 1, which has a time complexity of O(sqrt(x)). There are more efficient algorithms for checking primality, such as the Miller-Rabin primality test or the Sieve of Eratosthenes. Consider using one of these algorithms to improve the efficiency of the primality check.

4. Optimize the `gen_max_test` function to generate the test case more efficiently.
   - The current `gen_max_test` function generates a test case by finding prime numbers. This approach is inefficient because it iterates through numbers and checks if each number is prime. Instead, consider using a more efficient algorithm such as the Sieve of Eratosthenes to generate the prime numbers.

5. Optimize the `gen_all` function to generate all possible products more efficiently.
   - The current `gen_all` function generates all possible products of elements from a given vector by recursively multiplying each element with the next element. This approach has a time complexity of O(2^n), where n is the size of the vector. Instead, consider using a more efficient algorithm such as backtracking or dynamic programming to generate the products more efficiently.

6. Optimize the `cnt` function to count the number of elements more efficiently.
   - The current `cnt` function counts the number of elements in `A` that are less than or equal to a given value, and then uses `upper_bound` to count the number of elements in `B` that are less than or equal to `val / e`. This approach has a time complexity of O(n log m), where n is the size of `A`, m is the size of `B`, and log is the time complexity of `upper_bound`. Instead, consider using a more efficient algorithm such as binary search to count the number of elements more efficiently.
