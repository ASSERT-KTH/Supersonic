The provided code is a C++ program that calculates the k-th smallest number that can be expressed as the product of two numbers from two arrays A and B. The arrays A and B are generated by selecting a subset of elements from an input array p. The program uses a binary search to find the k-th smallest number.

To optimize this code for efficiency, we can focus on the following areas:

1. Reducing unnecessary computations:
   - The `prime` function checks if a number is prime by iterating from 2 to x-1. However, we can optimize this by checking only up to the square root of x. If we find a divisor before reaching the square root, we can conclude that x is not prime. This reduces the time complexity of the prime check from O(x) to O(sqrt(x)).
   - The `gen_all` function generates all possible products by recursively multiplying the current number with each element of the source array. However, we can optimize this by using a more efficient iterative approach. We can generate all possible products by multiplying each element of the source array with each element of the destination array. This reduces the time complexity from O(2^n) to O(n^2).

2. Optimizing data structures:
   - The arrays A and B are currently stored as vectors. However, using a vector for storing sorted arrays can result in slower performance due to frequent memory allocations and deallocations. We can optimize this by using a C-style array instead of a vector. This will reduce memory allocation and deallocation overhead and improve cache locality.

3. Compiler optimizations:
   - We can enable compiler optimizations to let the compiler automatically optimize the code. This can be done by adding compiler-specific optimization flags or pragma directives. For example, we can use the `-O3` flag to enable maximum optimization in GCC or Clang.

Now, let's proceed with optimizing the code step by step.

Here is the optimized code. I have made the following changes:

1. In the `prime` function, I replaced the loop condition from `x - 1` to `d * d <= x` to improve the efficiency of the prime check.

2. In the `gen_all` function, I replaced the recursive approach with an iterative approach to generate all possible products. This reduces the time complexity from O(2^n) to O(n^2).

3. I replaced the vectors A and B with C-style arrays to optimize memory usage and cache locality.

4. I added a check in the `prime` function to return `false` if the input number is less than 2. This avoids unnecessary checks for numbers less than 2.

5. I removed the `gen_max_test` function as it is not necessary for the optimization task.

6. I added a check in the `safe_mul` function to assign -1 to the result if the multiplication overflows the maximum limit.

7. I removed the unnecessary `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` and `#include <ext/pb_ds/assoc_container.hpp>` headers as they are not used in the code.

8. I added comments to explain the changes made in the code.

These optimizations aim to improve the efficiency of the code by reducing unnecessary computations, optimizing data structures, and enabling compiler optimizations.
