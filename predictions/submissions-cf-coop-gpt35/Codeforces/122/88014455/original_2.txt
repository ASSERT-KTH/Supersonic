Analysis:
- The code includes unnecessary header files (`<bits/stdc++.h>`) which can slow down the compilation process.
- The `#define` directives are used to define macros. While macros can improve code readability and reduce the number of characters to be typed, they can also introduce potential bugs and make the code harder to debug.
- The code uses the `using namespace std` directive, which can lead to name clashes and make the code less maintainable.
- The code uses a fixed array `divisors` to check if a number is divisible by any of the divisors. This approach is not efficient for large numbers as it requires iterating over the entire array.
- The code uses `cout` for each "YES" or "NO" output, which can result in slower output due to the frequent flushing of the output buffer.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Remove unnecessary header files.
2. Replace macros with inline functions for improved type safety and better compile-time error checking.
3. Avoid using `using namespace std` to prevent potential naming conflicts.
4. Replace the fixed array `divisors` with a more efficient approach to check divisibility.
5. Use a single `cout` statement for the output to reduce the number of flushes.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Remove unnecessary header files:
   - Remove the `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` line since it includes a large number of standard library headers, resulting in slower compilation times. Instead, include only the necessary headers, such as `<iostream>`, `<vector>`, and `<utility>`.
   
2. Replace macros with inline functions:
   - Replace the macro definitions with inline functions to improve type safety and enable better compile-time error checking. For example, replace `#define ll long long` with `typedef long long ll;` or `using ll = long long;`.
   
3. Avoid using `using namespace std`:
   - Remove the `using namespace std` directive to prevent potential naming conflicts and make the code more maintainable. Instead, use the `std::` prefix for standard library types and functions.

4. Replace the fixed array `divisors`:
   - Use a more efficient approach to check divisibility by any of the divisors. One possible approach is to iterate over the digits of the number and check if each digit is either 4 or 7. If any digit is not 4 or 7, the number is not divisible by any of the divisors.
   
5. Use a single `cout` statement for the output:
   - Instead of using multiple `cout` statements for each "YES" or "NO" output, use a single `cout` statement outside the loop. This reduces the number of flushes and improves output performance.

Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <utility>

typedef long long ll;

inline int _min(const int& x, const int& y) {
    return x < y ? x : y;
}

inline int _max(const int& x, const int& y) {
    return x > y ? x : y;
}

void solve() {
    ll n;
    std::cin >> n;
    
    while (n > 0) {
        int digit = n % 10;
        if (digit != 4 && digit != 7) {
            std::cout << "NO\n";
            return;
        }
        n /= 10;
    }
    
    std::cout << "YES\n";
}

int main() {
#ifdef APAN
    freopen("input.txt", "r", stdin);
    freopen("output.txt", "w", stdout);
#endif

    std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    std::cin.tie(NULL);

    solve();

    return 0;
}
```

Note: The optimized code may not necessarily result in a significant improvement in performance, especially for small input sizes. However, it is expected to be more efficient and maintainable in the long run.
