The given code is a C++ program that takes input for the number of test cases `t`, followed by `t` pairs of integers `n` and `d`. For each pair, the program checks if there exists a number `q` such that `q` is divisible by `i+1` and `i+q` is less than or equal to `n`. If such a number exists, it prints "YES", otherwise it prints "NO".

Upon analysis, the following potential optimizations and improvements can be made:

1. Remove unnecessary header inclusion: The code includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header, which is not a standard C++ header. Instead, it is recommended to include the specific headers required by the program to avoid unnecessary overhead.

2. Simplify and optimize the input/output functions: The current implementation uses custom input/output functions that are not necessary. Instead, we can use the standard `cin` and `cout` functions for input/output, which are more efficient.

3. Remove unnecessary macros: The code defines several macros such as `ll`, `ld`, `p`, `pb`, `PB`, `mp`, `ii`, `vii`, `vi`, `F`, `S`, `max3`, and `min3`. However, these macros are not used in the provided code. Removing them will reduce clutter and improve readability.

4. Use more meaningful variable names: The variable names `n`, `d`, `t`, `q`, and `t` are not very descriptive. Using more meaningful names will improve code readability.

5. Optimize the loop: The current loop runs from `1` to `n` and performs a calculation for each iteration. This can be optimized by starting the loop from `n` and decrementing `i` in each iteration until `i` becomes `0`. This optimization reduces the number of iterations and simplifies the calculation.

With these optimizations in mind, here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

void solve() {
    int n, d;
    cin >> n >> d;
    if (d <= n) {
        cout << "YES\n";
        return;
    }
    for (int i = n; i > 0; i--) {
        int q = (d - 1) / (i + 1) + 1;
        int t = i + q;
        if (t <= n) {
            cout << "YES\n";
            return;
        }
    }
    cout << "NO\n";
}

int main() {
    int t;
    cin >> t;
    while (t--)
        solve();
    return 0;
}
```

This optimized code removes unnecessary macros and header inclusions, simplifies the input/output functions, and optimizes the loop. It maintains the functionality and output of the original code while improving performance and readability.
