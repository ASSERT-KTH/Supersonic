This code appears to be a solution to a programming problem. However, it contains several inefficiencies and unnecessary code that can be optimized. Let's analyze the code and propose optimization strategies.

1. The code includes unnecessary headers: `bits/stdc++.h` includes all standard library headers, which can slow down compilation time. It's better to include only the necessary headers.

2. The code defines macros for commonly used operations, such as `p`, `pb`, `PB`, `mp`, `F`, `S`, etc. However, using macros can lead to unexpected behavior and make the code harder to read and debug. It's better to avoid macros and use regular function calls or inline functions instead.

3. The code defines templates for printing and spacing elements. While this might be convenient, it can increase the code size and slow down compilation. It's better to use regular `cout` statements for printing.

4. The code uses `using namespace std`, which can lead to naming conflicts and make the code less readable. It's better to avoid using this directive and explicitly specify the namespace for each standard library component.

5. The code uses `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false)` to disable synchronization between C and C++ standard streams, which can improve input/output performance. However, it's unnecessary in this code as it doesn't use both C and C++ standard streams together.

6. The code uses `cin` and `cout` for input/output, which can be slower than using `scanf` and `printf` functions. It's better to use the latter for better performance.

7. The code uses a brute-force approach to solve the problem, which can be inefficient for large values of `n` and `d`. We can optimize the algorithm to improve its efficiency.

Based on these observations, let's propose an optimization strategy:

1. Remove unnecessary headers and macros.
2. Refactor the code to use regular `cout` statements for printing.
3. Remove the `using namespace std` directive and explicitly specify the namespace for each standard library component.
4. Replace `cin` and `cout` with `scanf` and `printf` for better input/output performance.
5. Optimize the algorithm to improve its efficiency.
