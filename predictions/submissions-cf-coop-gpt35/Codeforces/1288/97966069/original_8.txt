The provided code is a C++ program that solves a specific problem. However, the code contains several inefficiencies that can be optimized to improve performance and reduce memory usage.

1. Eliminate Unnecessary Function Definitions:
   The code includes several function definitions that are not used in the program. These function definitions can be safely removed to reduce unnecessary overhead.

2. Avoid Using the `bits/stdc++.h` Header:
   The code includes the `bits/stdc++.h` header, which is not a standard C++ header and is known to be slow to compile. It is recommended to include only the necessary standard library headers to reduce compilation time.

3. Remove Unnecessary Macros:
   The code includes several macros that are not used, such as `p`, `pb`, `PB`, `mp`, `F`, `S`, `max3`, and `min3`. These macros can be safely removed to improve code readability.

4. Minimize Input/Output Operations:
   The code uses the `cout` and `cin` objects for input/output operations. These operations can be expensive, especially when performed in a loop. To minimize the number of input/output operations, it is recommended to read the input values into variables and perform calculations on those variables before outputting the result.

5. Optimize the Loop:
   The code uses a loop to iterate from 1 to n to check if a certain condition is satisfied. This loop can be optimized by using a mathematical formula to calculate the condition directly, instead of iterating through each value of i. This optimization will reduce the time complexity of the loop from O(n) to O(1).

With these optimization strategies in mind, let's proceed with the optimized code.
