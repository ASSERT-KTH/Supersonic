The provided code appears to be a solution to a problem that involves checking whether a given condition is satisfied for a range of test cases. The code reads the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `d`. It then performs some calculations and prints "YES" or "NO" based on the result.

Upon analyzing the code, the following potential performance bottlenecks and areas for optimization can be identified:

1. Use of unnecessary header files: The code includes the entire `bits/stdc++.h` header file, which is not recommended as it includes a large number of unnecessary standard library headers. It is better to include only the necessary headers.

2. Excessive use of function templates: The code defines multiple template functions for printing values of different types. While this provides flexibility, it can also affect performance due to the overhead of template instantiation and function dispatching. It is better to use simple function overloads instead.

3. Use of unnecessary macros: The code includes several macros such as `max3`, `min3`, `p`, `pb`, `PB`, `mp`, `ii`, `vii`, `vi`, `F`, `S`, etc. While macros can be useful for code readability and brevity, excessive use of macros can make the code harder to understand and maintain. It is better to use explicit function calls or inline functions instead.

4. Inefficient loop structure: The code uses a loop to iterate from 1 to `n` and performs calculations inside the loop. However, the loop can be optimized to reduce the number of iterations and improve performance.

Based on these observations, the following optimization strategy can be formulated:

1. Remove unnecessary headers: Replace the `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` with the necessary standard library headers that are actually used in the code.

2. Replace function templates with function overloads: Remove the template functions `pe` and `ps` and replace them with simple overloaded functions for different types.

3. Replace macros with explicit function calls: Replace the macros with explicit function calls or inline functions to improve code readability and maintainability.

4. Optimize the loop structure: Analyze the loop structure and optimize it to reduce the number of iterations and improve performance.
