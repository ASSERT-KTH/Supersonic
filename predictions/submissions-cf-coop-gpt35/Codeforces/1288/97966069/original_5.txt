The given code appears to be a solution to a problem that involves solving multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers `n` and `d`. The goal is to determine whether it is possible to choose a positive integer `x` such that the sum of `x` and the integer division of `d` by `x+1` is less than or equal to `n`. The code uses a brute-force approach to solve each test case.

To optimize this code, we can focus on the following areas:

1. Unnecessary Macros: The code includes several unnecessary macros that increase code complexity and provide no performance benefit. These macros, such as `max3` and `min3`, can be replaced with their respective functions. Additionally, the `p` and `PB` macros can be removed as they are not used in the code.

2. Redundant Function Templates: The code includes several function templates (`pe`, `ps`) that provide a flexible way to print values. However, these templates are not used effectively in the code and can be simplified or removed.

3. Algorithm Optimization: The current implementation uses a brute-force approach to check all possible values of `x` in the range `[1, n]`. However, we can optimize this algorithm by using a binary search approach to find the maximum valid value of `x`. This will reduce the time complexity from O(n) to O(log n).

4. Input/Output Optimization: The code uses `cin` and `cout` for input and output operations, respectively. These operations are relatively slower compared to the C standard input/output functions (`scanf` and `printf`). By using the C standard functions, we can improve the input/output performance.

Taking these optimization strategies into consideration, let's proceed with optimizing the code step-by-step.
