The given code appears to be a C++ program that solves a problem involving some mathematical calculations. However, the code seems to be cluttered with unnecessary macros and function templates that may not contribute to its efficiency. Additionally, the code lacks proper comments and explanations, making it difficult to understand the purpose of each function and variable.

To optimize this code, we can take the following steps:

1. Remove unnecessary macros: The macros `p`, `pb`, `PB`, `mp`, `ii`, `vii`, `vi`, `F`, `S`, `max3`, and `min3` are not used in the code and can be safely removed.

2. Remove unnecessary function templates: The function templates `pe` and `ps` are not used in the code and can be removed.

3. Optimize input/output operations:
    - Replace `endl` with `"\n"` in the `pe` and `ps` functions. The `endl` manipulator flushes the output buffer, which can be an expensive operation. Using `"\n"` instead will improve the performance.
    - Replace `cout` with `printf` for faster output. The `printf` function is generally faster than `cout` for output operations. However, this change requires modifying the pe and ps functions.

4. Optimize the loop:
    - Remove the unnecessary check `if (d <= n)` before the loop. Since the loop runs from 1 to n, the condition will always be false unless n is less than or equal to d. Therefore, we can directly start the loop from 1.
    - Replace the division operation `((d - 1) / (i + 1)) + 1` with a more efficient calculation. We can use integer division and multiplication to achieve the same result.
