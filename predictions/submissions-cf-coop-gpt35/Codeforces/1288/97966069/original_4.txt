The given code appears to be a solution to a problem that involves solving a series of test cases. For each test case, the program reads two integers `n` and `d`, performs some calculations, and outputs either "YES" or "NO" based on certain conditions.

To optimize this code, we can focus on the following aspects:

1. Remove unnecessary includes and macros: The code includes `<bits/stdc++.h>` which is not a standard C++ header and may include unnecessary libraries. We can remove this line and include only the necessary headers like `<iostream>`, `<vector>`, `<algorithm>`, etc. Additionally, the macros like `max3`, `min3`, `p`, `pb`, `PB`, `mp`, `ii`, `vii`, `vi`, `F`, `S`, etc., are not used in the code and can be removed.

2. Improve input/output operations: The code uses `cout` and `cin` for input/output operations. These operations can be slow compared to other methods like `scanf` and `printf`. We can use `scanf` and `printf` instead of `cin` and `cout` to improve the performance.

3. Optimize the loop: The main bottleneck in the code seems to be the loop that iterates from `1` to `n`. For each iteration, it performs calculations and checks certain conditions. We can optimize this loop by reducing unnecessary calculations and avoiding unnecessary iterations.

Now, let's implement the optimizations step by step.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int t;
  scanf("%d", &t);
  
  while (t--) {
    long long n, d;
    scanf("%lld %lld", &n, &d);
    
    if (d <= n) {
      printf("YES\n");
      continue;
    }
    
    bool found = false;
    for (long long i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
      long long q = ((d - 1) / (i + 1)) + 1;
      long long t = i + q;
      if (t <= n) {
        found = true;
        break;
      }
    }
    
    if (found) {
      printf("YES\n");
    } else {
      printf("NO\n");
    }
  }
  
  return 0;
}
```

Here's a step-by-step explanation of the optimizations made:

1. Removed unnecessary includes and macros: The original code included `<bits/stdc++.h>` which is not a standard C++ header. Instead, we included only the necessary headers like `<iostream>`. Additionally, we removed the unused macros.

2. Improved input/output operations: Replaced `cin` and `cout` with `scanf` and `printf` respectively. These functions are generally faster for input/output operations.

3. Optimized the loop: Instead of using a function to print "YES" or "NO", we used a boolean variable `found` to track whether the condition is satisfied. If `found` is true, we break out of the loop and print "YES" afterwards. This avoids unnecessary iterations in case the condition is satisfied earlier.

By making these optimizations, we have improved the efficiency of the code by removing unnecessary operations, optimizing the loop, and using faster input/output methods.
