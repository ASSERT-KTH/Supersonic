Upon analyzing the given code, we can identify several areas that can be optimized to improve performance and reduce memory usage:

1. Use of the `bits/stdc++.h` header: This header includes all the standard library headers, which can result in increased compilation time and unnecessary inclusion of unused headers. It is better to include only the required headers.

2. Use of `using namespace std;`: This statement imports all the names from the `std` namespace into the global namespace, which can lead to naming conflicts and decrease code readability. It is recommended to use the `std::` prefix when referencing standard library entities.

3. Use of `#define` macros: While macros provide a convenient way to define constants and loops, they can be error-prone and difficult to debug. It is better to replace them with const variables and standard loop constructs.

4. Unnecessary calculations in the `check` function: The `check` function calculates the value of `p` (l/2) for every function call, which is unnecessary as `p` remains constant throughout the loop. It can be calculated once outside the loop.

5. Use of floating-point arithmetic: Floating-point arithmetic can be slower than integer arithmetic and may introduce rounding errors. If possible, we can try to replace floating-point calculations with integer calculations.

6. Inefficient loop structure: The loop structure used in the code is not optimal. It can be improved by using a binary search algorithm to find the desired value of `l` instead of a linear search.

7. Redundant `if` statement: The `if (ok == false)` statement inside the loop is redundant as `ok` is already a boolean value. We can remove the comparison and use `if (!ok)` instead.

8. Compiler optimizations: We can suggest the use of compiler optimizations, such as loop unrolling and inline function expansion, to improve performance.

Based on these observations, we can now proceed with the optimization strategy.
