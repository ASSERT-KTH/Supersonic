The given code appears to be a program that calculates the minimum radius of a circle that can encompass a regular polygon with `n` sides. The program takes an input `ct` which represents the number of test cases, and for each test case, it calculates the minimum radius and prints it.

Let's analyze the code and identify potential areas for optimization:

1. Unnecessary includes: 
    - The line `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` includes all the standard library headers, which can result in a larger compiled binary and slower compilation times. It is recommended to include only the necessary headers.

2. Redundant macros:
    - The macro `#define int long long` is not used in the code and can be removed.
    - The macro `#define rep(i, x, y)` is used for a loop but can be replaced with a more standard and readable `for` loop.

3. Unnecessary precision setting:
    - The line `cout << setprecision(9) << fixed;` sets the precision of the floating-point output to 9 decimal places. However, the problem statement does not specify the required precision, so this line can be removed.

4. Inefficient loop iteration:
    - The loop `rep(i, 0, 200)` iterates 200 times, which may be excessive. The value 200 appears to be an arbitrary choice and can potentially be reduced to improve performance.
    - The loop `rep(j, 0, 2 * n)` iterates `2 * n` times, which can be optimized by caching the value of `2 * n` outside of the loop.

5. Expensive trigonometric calculations:
    - The code computes the values of `cos(j * angle + pi / 4)` and `sin(j * angle + pi / 4)` in each iteration of the inner loop. These trigonometric calculations can be expensive and can potentially be optimized.

6. Inefficient check function:
    - The `check` function checks if a given point `(x, y)` lies within a square of side length `l`. However, the implementation of the function can be simplified.

Based on the analysis, here is the proposed optimization strategy:

1. Remove unnecessary includes and macros.
2. Remove the precision setting.
3. Optimize the loop iterations.
4. Optimize the trigonometric calculations.
5. Simplify the check function.

Now, let's proceed with the step-by-step explanation of each optimization step and provide the optimized code.
