Upon analyzing the code, we can identify a few potential areas for optimization:

1. Data Structure Usage:
   - The code uses a 2D vector `next` to store the indices of the next occurrence of each digit in the string. However, this is not necessary as we only need to store the indices of the next occurrence of 1, 2, and 3. We can replace the 2D vector with a simple array of size 4.
   - The vector `s` is used to store the input string. However, we only need to access the characters of the string individually, so using a simpler data structure like a character array would be more efficient.
   - The vector `next` is initialized with -1 for each element. Instead, we can initialize it with the maximum value to avoid unnecessary checks later on.

2. Redundant Computations:
   - The code computes the length of each substring multiple times in the loop. We can optimize this by computing the length of the substring only once and storing it in a variable.

3. Loop Optimization:
   - The loop that iterates over the characters of the string can be optimized by using a `char` type instead of `int` to avoid unnecessary conversions.
   - The loop that initializes the `next` array can be optimized by using a reverse loop instead of a forward loop, as the indices are being accessed in reverse order.

4. Compiler Optimizations:
   - The code already includes `#pragma` directives to optimize the code. However, we can also add additional directives like `-march=native` or `-mtune=native` to enable architecture-specific optimizations.

With these optimizations in mind, let's proceed to modify the code accordingly.
