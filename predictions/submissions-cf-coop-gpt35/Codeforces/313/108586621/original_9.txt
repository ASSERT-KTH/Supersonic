The given code seems to be calculating the sum of the top N elements from an input vector `a`, where N is taken as input. The code uses a queue to keep track of the indices of the elements to be considered for sum calculation. The algorithm works as follows:

1. Read the input `n`.
2. Read `n` elements into vector `a`.
3. Sort vector `a` in ascending order.
4. Initialize `root` to `n - 1` and `sum` to 0.
5. Create a queue `q` and push `n` into it.
6. While the queue is not empty, do the following:
   a. Pop the front element from the queue and store it in `top`.
   b. Add `a[top]` to `sum`.
   c. If `top` equals 1, break the loop.
   d. Push `top` back into the queue.
   e. Push `root--` into the queue three times.
7. Print the value of `sum`.

To optimize this code, we can focus on the following areas:

1. Avoiding unnecessary data structures.
2. Reducing unnecessary computations.
3. Minimizing the number of loop iterations.
4. Utilizing compiler optimizations.

Let's optimize the code step by step.
