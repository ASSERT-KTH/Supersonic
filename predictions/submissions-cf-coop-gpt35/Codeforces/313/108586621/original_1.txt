Upon analyzing the provided code, I have identified several potential areas for optimization:

1. Unnecessary includes: The code includes the entire `<bits/stdc++.h>` library, which can slow down compilation and increase memory usage. It is better to include only the necessary header files.

2. Redundant macros: The `sz`, `all`, `rall`, and `dbg` macros are defined but not used in the code. These macros can be removed to simplify the code.

3. Inefficient data structure: The code uses a `vector` to store the input array `a`, but it doesn't take advantage of any of the vector's features. Since the size of the array is known in advance, it would be more efficient to use a simple array instead of a vector.

4. Unnecessary sorting: The code sorts the input array `a` using the `sort` function. However, the sorted order is not used in any way, and the algorithm still works correctly without the sorting step. Therefore, the sorting step can be removed to improve performance.

5. Inefficient loop: The code uses a `while` loop with a `queue` to calculate the sum. However, the loop can be simplified to a single `for` loop, eliminating the need for the queue and improving performance.

Based on these observations, I propose the following optimization steps:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: Remove the `<bits/stdc++.h>` include and include only the necessary headers: `<iostream>`, `<vector>`, and `<queue>`.

2. Remove redundant macros: Remove the `sz`, `all`, `rall`, and `dbg` macros.

3. Replace vector with array: Replace the `vector<ll> a` with an array `ll a[N]`, where `N` is a constant representing the maximum size of the array.

4. Remove sorting step: Remove the `sort(all(a))` line.

5. Simplify the sum calculation loop: Replace the `while` loop with a `for` loop that iterates over the array `a` and calculates the sum directly. Remove the `queue` and the `top` variable.

I will now provide the optimized code block with the above-mentioned changes.
