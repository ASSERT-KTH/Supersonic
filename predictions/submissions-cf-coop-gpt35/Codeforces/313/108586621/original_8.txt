Upon analyzing the given code, we can identify a few potential areas for optimization:

1. The use of `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` is generally discouraged as it includes a large number of standard library headers, which can lead to increased compilation time and unnecessary memory usage. It is better to include only the necessary headers explicitly.

2. The `sz()` macro is used to get the size of a container, but it is not necessary since the `size()` member function of containers can be directly used.

3. The `all()` and `rall()` macros are used to get iterators to the beginning and end of a container, respectively. It is more efficient to use the `begin()` and `end()` member functions of containers directly.

4. The `dbg()` macro is used for debugging purposes, but it is not needed in the final optimized code. It can be removed.

5. The `typedef` statements for `ll` and `ull` are not used in the code and can be removed.

6. The `dp` array is declared but never used. It can be removed.

7. The sorting of the `a` vector is not necessary since the elements are already in non-decreasing order.

8. The `root` variable is not necessary and can be replaced with a simple counter.

9. The `queue` data structure is used to simulate a breadth-first search, but it is not the most efficient data structure for this task. A simple loop can be used instead.

10. The use of `ios::sync_with_stdio(0)`, `cin.tie(0)`, and `cout.tie(0)` can improve I/O performance, but it is not necessary in this specific code since there is no mixing of C and C++ I/O.

Based on these observations, we can propose the following optimization strategy:

1. Remove unnecessary headers and macros.
2. Remove unused variables and data structures.
3. Replace the sorting of the `a` vector with a simple loop.
4. Replace the `queue` data structure with a loop.
5. Remove unnecessary I/O optimizations.

Let's now proceed with the step-by-step explanation and provide the optimized code.
