The given code appears to calculate the sum of elements in an array after performing a specific operation. However, there are several areas where the code can be optimized to improve performance and minimize memory usage.

1. Remove unnecessary includes and macros: The code includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header, which is not a standard C++ header and can lead to slower compilation times. Additionally, the macros `sz`, `all`, `rall`, and `dbg` are not used in the code and can be removed.

2. Avoid unnecessary data copying: The code creates a copy of the input array `a` using the `all` function and then sorts the copied array. This unnecessary copying and sorting can be avoided by directly sorting the original array `a` itself.

3. Use iterators instead of indices: The code uses an index-based loop to iterate over the elements of the array `a`. It is more efficient to use iterators instead of indices, as iterators provide a more general and efficient way to access container elements.

4. Use a variable instead of calling `sz(q)` in the while loop condition: The code calls the `sz` macro to check the size of the `q` queue in the while loop condition. Instead, it is better to store the size of the queue in a variable before the loop and use that variable in the condition.

5. Use a variable instead of calling `q.front()` multiple times: The code calls the `q.front()` function multiple times within the loop. It is more efficient to store the front element in a variable and use that variable within the loop.

6. Optimize the loop that pushes elements into the queue: The code uses a loop to push elements into the queue. This loop can be optimized by using the `std::generate_n` function to generate the elements and push them into the queue.

7. Optimize the loop that calculates the sum: The code uses a loop to calculate the sum of the elements. This loop can be optimized by using the `std::accumulate` function, which is specifically designed for calculating the sum of elements in a range.
