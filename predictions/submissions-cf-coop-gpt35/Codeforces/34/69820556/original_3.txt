The given code reads an integer `n` followed by an integer `m`, and then reads `n` integers into an array. It sorts the array and calculates the sum of the first `m` negative integers in the sorted array. Finally, it prints the absolute value of the sum.

To optimize this code, we can focus on the following areas:

1. Memory Usage: The current code uses a dynamically allocated array `arr` of size `n`. This can be a performance bottleneck for large values of `n`. Instead, we can use a `std::vector` which automatically manages the memory and allows for more flexible resizing.

2. Sorting: The code uses the `std::sort` function to sort the array. However, the task only requires finding the sum of the first `m` negative integers. We can optimize the sorting process to only sort the first `m` elements, which will reduce the time complexity.

3. Unnecessary Headers: The code includes unnecessary headers such as `<bits/stdc++.h>`, `<array>`, and `<string>`. We can remove these headers to improve compilation time.

4. Input/Output: The current code uses `std::cin` and `std::cout` for input and output operations. These operations can be slower compared to other input/output methods such as `scanf` and `printf`. We can optimize the input/output by using these faster methods.

With these optimizations in mind, let's proceed with the step-by-step explanation and provide the optimized code.
