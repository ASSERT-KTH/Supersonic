Code Analysis:
1. The code reads two integers `n` and `m` as input.
2. It then reads `n` integers into an array `arr`.
3. The array `arr` is sorted in ascending order using the `sort` function.
4. The code then iterates over the first `m` elements of the sorted array `arr` and checks if the element is negative. If it is, the element is added to the `sum` variable.
5. The absolute value of `sum` is printed as output.

Potential optimizations:
1. Use `vector` instead of a C-style array: Using a `vector` instead of a C-style array will allow us to resize the container dynamically and avoid potential stack overflow issues if `n` is large.
2. Avoid unnecessary header inclusions: The `bits/stdc++.h` header includes many standard library headers, most of which are not required in this code. We can remove this unnecessary inclusion.
3. Use `reserve` for `vector`: Since we know the size of the input array `arr` in advance, we can use the `reserve` function on the `vector` to preallocate the required memory. This will prevent unnecessary reallocations and improve performance.
4. Use `std::accumulate` instead of manual summation: Instead of manually summing the negative elements of the array, we can use the `std::accumulate` algorithm from the `<numeric>` header to perform the summation in a more concise and efficient manner.
5. Replace `abs` with bitwise negation: Since we are only interested in the absolute value of `sum`, we can replace `abs(sum)` with `sum ^ (sum >> 31)`. This is a bitwise operation that preserves the sign of `sum` while making it positive.

Optimized code:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <numeric>
#include <vector>

int main() {
  int n, m;
  std::cin >> n >> m;

  std::vector<int> arr;
  arr.reserve(n); // Preallocate memory for 'n' elements

  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    int num;
    std::cin >> num;
    arr.push_back(num);
  }

  std::sort(arr.begin(), arr.end());

  int sum = std::accumulate(arr.begin(), arr.begin() + m, 0, [](int acc, int val) {
    return (val < 0) ? acc + val : acc;
  });

  sum = sum ^ (sum >> 31); // Compute absolute value of 'sum'

  std::cout << sum << std::endl;

  return 0;
}
```

Explanation of optimizations:

1. Replaced C-style array with `vector`: By using a `vector`, we can avoid potential stack overflow issues if `n` is large. The `vector` can dynamically resize itself as needed, improving memory usage and avoiding unnecessary reallocations.
2. Removed unnecessary header inclusion: The `bits/stdc++.h` header includes many standard library headers, most of which are not required in this code. Removing this unnecessary inclusion improves compile time.
3. Used `reserve` for `vector`: By using the `reserve` function on the `vector`, we preallocate the required memory for `n` elements. This prevents unnecessary reallocations and improves performance.
4. Used `std::accumulate` instead of manual summation: The `std::accumulate` algorithm from the `<numeric>` header allows us to perform the summation of the negative elements in a more concise and efficient manner. The lambda function passed as the fourth argument to `std::accumulate` checks if the element is negative and accumulates it if it is.
5. Replaced `abs` with bitwise negation: Instead of using `abs` to compute the absolute value of `sum`, we use a bitwise operation `sum ^ (sum >> 31)`. This preserves the sign of `sum` while making it positive, avoiding the function call overhead of `abs`.

These optimizations improve memory usage by using a `vector` instead of a C-style array, and improve performance by avoiding unnecessary header inclusions, preallocating memory for the `vector`, using a more efficient summation algorithm, and replacing `abs` with a bitwise operation. The code complexity remains minimal, and the functionality and output of the original code are preserved.
