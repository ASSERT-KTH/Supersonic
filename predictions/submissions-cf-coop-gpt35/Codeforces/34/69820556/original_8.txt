Code Analysis:
- The code reads two integers `n` and `m` from the input.
- It then reads `n` integers into an array `arr`.
- The array `arr` is then sorted.
- The code then calculates the sum of the first `m` negative numbers in the sorted array `arr`.
- The absolute value of the sum is printed as the output.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Use a more efficient data structure to store the array elements.
2. Avoid unnecessary includes.
3. Optimize the sorting algorithm.
4. Optimize the calculation of the sum.
5. Utilize compiler optimizations.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Replace the usage of a variable-length array `int arr[n]` with a `std::vector<int> arr` to improve memory efficiency and eliminate potential stack overflow issues.
2. Remove unnecessary includes such as `<bits/stdc++.h>` and `<string>`.
3. Replace the `std::sort` algorithm with a more efficient sorting algorithm such as `std::partial_sort` or `std::nth_element` since we only need to find the first `m` smallest elements in the array.
4. Instead of sorting the entire array, we can use a partial sort algorithm to sort only the first `m` elements of the array. This will reduce the time complexity from O(n log n) to O(m log m).
5. Instead of summing the negative elements separately, we can sum all the elements and then subtract the sum of the positive elements. This eliminates the need for the conditional check in the loop.
6. Utilize compiler optimizations such as loop unrolling and enabling optimization flags to allow the compiler to automatically optimize the code.

Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

int main() {
  int n, m;
  std::cin >> n >> m;
  std::vector<int> arr(n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    std::cin >> arr[i];
  }
  
  std::partial_sort(arr.begin(), arr.begin() + m, arr.end());
  int sum = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    sum += arr[i];
  }
  sum -= std::accumulate(arr.begin() + m, arr.end(), 0);
  
  std::cout << std::abs(sum) << std::endl;
  return 0;
}
```

The optimized code replaces the variable-length array with a `std::vector` to improve memory efficiency. It uses `std::partial_sort` to sort only the first `m` elements of the array. It sums all the elements and then subtracts the sum of the positive elements to calculate the sum of the negative elements. Compiler optimizations can be applied by enabling optimization flags during compilation.
