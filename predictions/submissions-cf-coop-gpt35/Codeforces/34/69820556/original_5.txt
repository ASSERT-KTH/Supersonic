Code Analysis:
1. The code reads two integers from the input: `n` and `m`.
2. It then reads `n` integers from the input and stores them in an array `arr`.
3. The array `arr` is sorted using the `std::sort` function from the `<algorithm>` header.
4. The code calculates the sum of the first `m` negative elements in the sorted array `arr`.
5. The absolute value of the sum is printed to the output.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Replace the use of C-style arrays with `std::vector` to avoid potential memory access issues and simplify memory management.
2. Sort only the first `m` elements instead of sorting the entire array.
3. Use a separate variable to keep track of the sum, instead of using the `sum` variable inside the loop.
4. Use the prefix increment operator (`++i`) instead of the postfix increment operator (`i++`) in the loops.
5. Use the range-based `for` loop instead of the traditional `for` loop to simplify iteration over the input elements.
6. Avoid unnecessary includes, such as `<bits/stdc++.h>`, which is not a standard C++ header.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Replace the C-style array `int arr[n]` with a `std::vector<int> arr(n)` to simplify memory management and avoid potential memory access issues. This also allows us to use the `size()` function to get the size of the array.
2. Sort only the first `m` elements of the array `arr` by using the `std::partial_sort` function instead of `std::sort`. This reduces the time complexity of the sorting operation from O(n log n) to O(m log m).
3. Use a separate variable `negativeSum` to keep track of the sum of negative elements. Initialize it to 0 before the loop.
4. Iterate over the input elements using a range-based `for` loop instead of the traditional `for` loop. This simplifies the loop and eliminates the need for an index variable.
5. Check if each element is negative. If it is, add it to the `negativeSum` variable. If it's not, break out of the loop.
6. Print the absolute value of `negativeSum` to the output.

Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

int main() {
  int n, m;
  std::cin >> n >> m;

  std::vector<int> arr(n);
  for (int& num : arr) {
    std::cin >> num;
  }

  std::partial_sort(arr.begin(), arr.begin() + m, arr.end());

  int negativeSum = 0;
  for (int num : arr) {
    if (num < 0) {
      negativeSum += num;
    } else {
      break;
    }
  }

  std::cout << std::abs(negativeSum) << std::endl;

  return 0;
}
```

By making these optimizations, we improve the efficiency of the code by reducing unnecessary operations and potentially reducing memory access issues.
