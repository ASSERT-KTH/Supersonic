The provided code reads an integer `n` and an integer `m` from the user. It then reads `n` more integers into an array `arr`, sorts the array, and calculates the sum of the first `m` negative numbers in the array. Finally, it prints the absolute value of the sum.

To optimize this code, we can focus on the following areas:

1. Avoid unnecessary includes: The code includes several unnecessary headers, such as `<bits/stdc++.h>` and `<array>`. We can remove them since they are not used in the code.

2. Minimize memory usage: The code uses a fixed-size array `arr` to store the input numbers. Using a dynamic container, such as `std::vector`, can reduce memory usage and allow for efficient resizing if needed.

3. Improve sorting efficiency: The code uses `std::sort` to sort the array. We can replace it with a more efficient sorting algorithm, such as `std::partial_sort`, since we only need to find the smallest `m` elements.

4. Optimize the loop: The loop that calculates the sum of the negative numbers can be optimized by breaking early if a non-negative number is encountered. This avoids unnecessary iterations.

5. Use `std::abs` instead of a conditional statement: Instead of using an `if-else` statement to determine whether to add a negative number or not, we can simply use `std::abs` to calculate the absolute value of the sum.
