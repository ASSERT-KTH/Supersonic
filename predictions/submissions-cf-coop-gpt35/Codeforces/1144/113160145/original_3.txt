Upon analyzing the given code, I have identified several areas that can be optimized for better performance:

1. Unnecessary includes: The code includes unnecessary headers, such as `<ext/pb_ds/assoc_container.hpp>` and `<ext/pb_ds/tree_policy.hpp>`. These headers are not used in the code and can be removed.

2. `typedef` usage: The code uses typedefs for various data types, such as `ll`, `ld`, `pl`, `vl`, etc. While typedefs can improve code readability, they can also introduce unnecessary complexity and reduce performance. It is better to use the actual data types instead of typedefs.

3. Unused functions: The code defines several functions, such as `make_unique`, `debb`, and `_debb`, that are not used in the code. These functions can be safely removed to improve code readability and reduce memory usage.

4. Redundant vector erasing: The `make_unique` function uses the `erase` function to remove duplicate elements from a vector. However, the code does not use the `make_unique` function anywhere. This function can be safely removed.

5. Unnecessary sorting: The code does not require sorting of any vectors or arrays. Therefore, the call to the `sort` function can be removed.

6. Inefficient loop constructs: The code uses `fo` and `Fo` macros to iterate over a range. However, these macros are not necessary and can be replaced with simple `for` loops.

7. Inefficient map usage: The code uses a map, `u`, to store pairs of nodes and their corresponding values. However, the map is not used efficiently. Instead of storing the values for both `{node, child}` and `{child, node}`, we can store the value for `{node, child}` only and calculate the value for `{child, node}` using the bitwise XOR operator (`^`). This will reduce the memory usage and improve performance.

8. Redundant checks: The code uses redundant checks, such as `if (u.find({node, child}) != u.end())`, to determine if a key-value pair exists in the map. This check can be avoided by using the `operator[]` directly on the map.

Based on these observations, here is the optimized version of the code:
