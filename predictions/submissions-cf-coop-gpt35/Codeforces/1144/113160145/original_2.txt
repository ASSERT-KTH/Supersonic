Upon analyzing the given code, we can identify several potential areas for optimization:

1. Redundant includes: The code includes unnecessary headers, such as `<bits/stdc++.h>` and `<ext/pb_ds/tree_policy.hpp>`. These should be removed to improve compilation time.

2. Unused functions: The code defines several debugging functions (`debb()`, `_debb()`) that are not used in the main program. These functions can be safely removed to reduce code size and improve readability.

3. Unnecessary data structures: The code uses a `map` (`u`) to store the relationship between nodes in the graph. However, this map is only used to determine if a relationship already exists between two nodes. Instead of using a map, we can use a simple boolean array to achieve the same result with better performance.

4. Inefficient graph representation: The code uses an adjacency list (`g`) to represent the graph. However, the current implementation requires searching the adjacency list for each child node to check if it has been visited. This can be improved by using a boolean array (`vis`) to track visited nodes.

5. Inefficient loop: The loop in the `solve()` function does not have a return statement. It is unclear what the purpose of this function is, so we can remove it since it does not affect the program's output.

Based on these observations, we can propose the following optimization steps:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: Remove the unnecessary headers `<bits/stdc++.h>` and `<ext/pb_ds/tree_policy.hpp>` to improve compilation time.

2. Remove unused functions: Remove the unused debugging functions `debb()`, `_debb()` to reduce code size and improve readability.

3. Replace map with boolean array: Replace the `map` `u` with a boolean array to represent the relationship between nodes.

4. Use a boolean array to track visited nodes: Replace the `vis` array with a boolean array to track visited nodes in the graph.

5. Remove the `solve()` function: Remove the `solve()` function, as it does not have a return statement and does not affect the program's output.

Let's implement these optimizations in the code:
