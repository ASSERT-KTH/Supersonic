The given code appears to be a C++ program that solves a graph coloring problem. The program takes input in the form of the number of nodes `n` and the number of edges `m`, and then reads `m` pairs of nodes representing edges. The program uses a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm to color the graph with two colors, such that no two adjacent nodes have the same color. Finally, the program outputs whether the graph can be colored in this way and the colors assigned to each edge.

Upon analyzing the code, several potential areas for optimization can be identified:

1. Redundant includes: The code includes unnecessary header files, such as `<bits/stdc++.h>` and `<ext/pb_ds/tree_policy.hpp>`. These should be removed to reduce unnecessary code bloat.

2. Redundant macros: The code defines several macros that are not used in the program. These macros, such as `fo`, `Fo`, `deb`, `deb2`, `print`, `T`, `tol`, and `tou`, can be safely removed to simplify the code.

3. Inefficient data structures: The code uses a `map` to store the colors assigned to each edge, represented as pairs of nodes. However, a `map` has a logarithmic time complexity for insertion and retrieval, which can be optimized by using a more efficient data structure.

4. Inefficient graph representation: The code uses an adjacency list to represent the graph, where each node is associated with a list of its adjacent nodes. However, this representation is not memory-efficient, as it requires additional space to store the adjacency list for each node. An alternative representation, such as an adjacency matrix, can be more memory-efficient in some cases.

5. Inefficient DFS algorithm: The DFS algorithm used in the code is recursive, which can lead to stack overflow errors for large graphs. Additionally, the algorithm does not take advantage of tail recursion optimization. Consider optimizing the DFS algorithm to make it more efficient and stack-friendly.

6. Inefficient output: The program outputs the colors assigned to each edge using multiple `cout` statements. This can be optimized by storing the output in a string and then printing it in a single `cout` statement.

Based on these observations, the following optimization steps can be proposed:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: Remove the following unnecessary includes:
   ```cpp
   #include <bits/stdc++.h>
   #include <ext/pb_ds/assoc_container.hpp>
   #include <ext/pb_ds/tree_policy.hpp>
   ```

2. Remove unnecessary macros: Remove the following unnecessary macros:
   ```cpp
   #define fo(i, n)
   #define Fo(i, n)
   #define deb(x)
   #define deb2(x, y)
   #define print(v)
   #define T
   #define tol(s)
   #define tou(s)
   ```

3. Optimize data structures:
   - Replace the `map` `u` with a more efficient data structure, such as a `vector` or an `array`, to store the colors assigned to each edge. Since the graph has `m` edges, a `vector` of size `m` can be used to store the colors.
   - Modify the code to directly assign colors to the corresponding index in the `vector` instead of using `{node, child}` as the key in the `map`.

4. Optimize graph representation:
   - Replace the adjacency list representation `g` with an adjacency matrix to improve memory efficiency. An adjacency matrix can be represented as a 2D `vector` or a dynamically allocated 2D array.
   - Modify the code accordingly to use the adjacency matrix representation.

5. Optimize DFS algorithm:
   - Implement an iterative version of the DFS algorithm using a stack data structure to avoid potential stack overflow issues.
   - Consider implementing tail recursion optimization by using an explicit stack instead of the function call stack.
   - Modify the code to use the optimized DFS algorithm.

6. Optimize output:
   - Instead of printing the colors assigned to each edge using multiple `cout` statements, store the output in a string and then print the string using a single `cout` statement.

Now, let's apply these optimization steps to the code.
