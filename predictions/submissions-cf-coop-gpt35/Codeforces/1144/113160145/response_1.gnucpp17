Code Analysis:
- The code includes unnecessary header files that are not used in the program.
- The code defines several macros that are not used or are redundant.
- The code defines a custom debugging function `debb()` and its related helper functions. These functions are not used in the program and can be removed.
- The code uses `endl` instead of `'\n'` for line breaks. `endl` flushes the output buffer, which can be expensive. Using `'\n'` is more efficient.
- The code defines a macro `T` that is not used.
- The code uses a global variable `M` that is not necessary.
- The code does not have a return statement for the `solve()` function.
- The code does not have any comments, making it difficult to understand the purpose of each section.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Remove unnecessary header files: Remove the `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` and `#include <ext/pb_ds/assoc_container.hpp>` headers, as they are not used in the program.
2. Remove unused macros: Remove the macros that are not used in the program, such as `debb()` related macros, `T`, `pql`, `pqh`, `lb`, `ub`, `tol()`, `tou()`, `print()`.
3. Replace `endl` with `'\n'`: Replace all occurrences of `endl` with `'\n'` to avoid unnecessary flushing of the output buffer.
4. Remove unused variables: Remove the unused variables `cnt`, `ans`, `sum`, `flag`, `pos`, `ind`, `mn`, `mx`, `res`.
5. Add comments: Add comments to explain the purpose of each section of the code and to improve code readability.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Remove unnecessary header files:
   - Remove the following lines:
     ```cpp
     #include <bits/stdc++.h>
     #include <ext/pb_ds/assoc_container.hpp>
     #include <ext/pb_ds/tree_policy.hpp>
     ```
   - These header files are not used in the program and can be removed.

2. Remove unused macros:
   - Remove the following macros:
     ```cpp
     #define ll long long int
     #define ld long double
     #define ff first
     #define ss second
     #define debb(x) cout << #x << "=" << x << endl
     #define deb2(x, y) cout << #x << "=" << x << "," << #y << "=" << y << endl
     ```
   - These macros are not used in the program and can be removed.

3. Replace `endl` with `'\n'`:
   - Replace all occurrences of `endl` with `'\n'` in the code.
   - `endl` flushes the output buffer, which can be expensive. Using `'\n'` is more efficient and sufficient for line breaks.

4. Remove unused variables:
   - Remove the following variables:
     ```cpp
     ll cnt = 0, ans = 0, sum = 0, flag = 0, pos = -1, ind = -1, mn = inf, mx = -inf, res = 0;
     ```
   - These variables are not used in the program and can be removed.

5. Add comments:
   - Add comments to explain the purpose of each section of the code and improve code readability.
