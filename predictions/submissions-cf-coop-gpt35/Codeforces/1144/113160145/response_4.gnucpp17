The given code appears to be a C++ program that solves a graph theory problem. However, there are several areas in the code that can be optimized for better performance. Let's go through each optimization step:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The code includes several unnecessary header files, such as `<bits/stdc++.h>`, `<ext/pb_ds/assoc_container.hpp>`, and `<ext/pb_ds/tree_policy.hpp>`. These headers are not used in the code and can be removed.

2. Replace `endl` with `'\n'`: The code uses `endl` to print a newline character, but `endl` also flushes the output buffer which can be expensive. It is more efficient to use `'\n'` instead.

3. Use `unordered_map` instead of `map`: The code uses `map` to store a mapping between pairs of nodes and their corresponding values. However, `unordered_map` provides faster average access time for inserting and retrieving elements.

4. Avoid unnecessary function calls: The code defines a function `make_unique` that removes duplicate elements from a vector. However, this function is not used in the code and can be removed.

5. Avoid unnecessary debugging functions: The code defines several debugging functions (`debb`) that print the values of different data types. These functions are not used in the code and can be removed.

6. Optimize the `dfs` function: The `dfs` function performs a depth-first search on the graph. However, it can be optimized by avoiding unnecessary checks and redundant assignments. Instead of checking if `u` contains a key using `u.find()`, we can use the `[]` operator to directly access the value. Additionally, we can use a reference parameter for `pv` instead of passing it by value to avoid unnecessary copies.

7. Use a more efficient data structure for the graph: The code represents the graph using an array of vectors (`g`) to store the adjacency list. However, this data structure can be improved by using a more efficient container, such as an `unordered_map` or `unordered_set`.

8. Use a more efficient algorithm: The code solves the graph theory problem by performing a depth-first search. While this is a valid approach, there might be more efficient algorithms available for solving the problem. Consider researching and implementing a more efficient algorithm if possible.
