Code Analysis:
- The code includes a number of preprocessor directives and macros that define various functions and constants.
- The code also includes several template functions and operator overloads for various data types.
- The main function includes a series of calculations and manipulations of mod_int objects.
- The code uses several loops and mathematical operations to compute the final result.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Remove unnecessary preprocessor directives and macros: The preprocessor directives and macros in the code are not used or have minimal impact on performance. Removing them will simplify the code and improve readability.
2. Simplify the mod_int class: The mod_int class can be simplified by removing unnecessary functions and operators, such as the increment and decrement operators.
3. Optimize the calculation of P[]: The calculation of P[] can be optimized by avoiding unnecessary exponentiation and addition operations.
4. Optimize the calculation of ele[]: The calculation of ele[] can be optimized by avoiding unnecessary multiplication and division operations.
5. Optimize the calculation of ans: The calculation of ans can be optimized by avoiding unnecessary multiplication and addition operations.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Remove unnecessary preprocessor directives and macros: The preprocessor directives and macros, such as pb, ppb, pf, ppf, can be removed as they are not used in the code and have no impact on performance.
2. Simplify the mod_int class: The mod_int class can be simplified by removing the increment and decrement operators, as they are not used in the code. This will reduce the complexity of the class and improve performance.
3. Optimize the calculation of P[]: The calculation of P[] can be optimized by avoiding unnecessary exponentiation and addition operations. Instead of calculating the power of j for each value of i, we can calculate the power of j once and multiply it with the previous value of P[i-1]. This will reduce the number of exponentiation operations and improve performance.
4. Optimize the calculation of ele[]: The calculation of ele[] can be optimized by avoiding unnecessary multiplication and division operations. Instead of calculating the product and division for each value of i, we can calculate the product and division once and update it for each value of i. This will reduce the number of multiplication and division operations and improve performance.
5. Optimize the calculation of ans: The calculation of ans can be optimized by avoiding unnecessary multiplication and addition operations. Instead of calculating the product and addition for each value of i, we can calculate the product and addition once and update it for each value of i. This will reduce the number of multiplication and addition operations and improve performance.
