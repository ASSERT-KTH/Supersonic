Code Analysis:
- The code includes numerous macros and template functions that are not used in the given code. These can be removed to reduce clutter and improve readability.
- The use of `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` is not recommended as it includes the entire standard library and can cause unnecessary overhead. Instead, specific header files should be included as needed.
- The code uses unnecessary typedefs and operator overloading for pairs and custom modulo operations. These can be simplified to improve code readability and reduce memory usage.
- The code uses a precomputed array `P` to store power values. However, this array is only used up to `k + 4`, even though it is initialized up to `N`. This wastes memory and can be optimized.
- The code uses a precomputed array `ele` to store intermediate results. However, the array is only used up to `k + 3`, even though it is initialized up to `N`. This wastes memory and can be optimized.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Remove unnecessary macros and template functions to improve code readability.
2. Replace the use of `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` with specific header files that are actually needed.
3. Simplify the code by removing unnecessary typedefs and operator overloading.
4. Optimize the initialization of the `P` array to only store values up to `k + 4`.
5. Optimize the initialization of the `ele` array to only store values up to `k + 3`.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Remove unnecessary macros and template functions to improve code readability:
   - Remove the `pb`, `ppb`, `pf`, `ppf`, `all`, `sz`, `int`, `M`, `MOD`, `MM`, `fr`, `sc`, `pii`, `rep`, `mem1`, `mem0`, and `ppc` macros.
   - Remove the template functions `operator>>`, `operator<<`, `operator+=`, `operator-=`, `amax`, and `amin`.
   - Remove the `fast_mod`, `operator*=` and `operator/=` functions from the `mod_int` struct.

2. Replace the use of `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` with specific header files that are actually needed:
   - Replace `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` with `#include <iostream>`, `#include <vector>`, `#include <utility>`, `#include <algorithm>`, `#include <cassert>`, and `#include <cstdint>`.

3. Simplify the code by removing unnecessary typedefs and operator overloading:
   - Remove the `typedef long long int` for `int` and replace it with `int64_t`.
   - Remove the `typedef pair<int, int>` for `pii` and replace it with `std::pair<int64_t, int64_t>`.
   - Remove the operator overloading for pairs and custom modulo operations.

4. Optimize the initialization of the `P` array to only store values up to `k + 4`:
   - Change the size of the `P` array from `N` to `k + 4`.
   - Remove the loop that initializes the `P` array up to `N` and replace it with a loop that initializes it up to `k + 4`.

5. Optimize the initialization of the `ele` array to only store values up to `k + 3`:
   - Change the size of the `ele` array from `N` to `k + 3`.
   - Remove the loop that initializes the `ele` array up to `N` and replace it with a loop that initializes it up to `k + 3`.
