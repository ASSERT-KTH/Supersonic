The given code is a C++ program that calculates the minimum sum of absolute differences between the elements of an array and their corresponding powers of an integer `i`. The program takes an integer `n` as input, followed by `n` integers representing the elements of the array.

Upon analysis of the code, the following potential performance bottlenecks and areas for optimization can be identified:

1. Redundant calculations: The program calculates the powers of `i` for each element of the array inside the inner loop. Since the powers of `i` are independent of the array elements, these calculations can be moved outside the loop to avoid redundant calculations.

2. Inefficient data types: The program uses `int` for the array elements and `ll` (long long) for intermediate calculations. However, the problem statement does not specify any constraints on the input values, so it is more appropriate to use `ll` for both the array elements and intermediate calculations to avoid potential overflow.

3. Inefficient loop bounds: The inner loop iterates from 0 to `n`, which is unnecessary since the powers of `i` become larger than the maximum possible array element value after a certain point. Therefore, the loop can be optimized by terminating early when the powers of `i` exceed the maximum array element value.

4. Inefficient range of `i`: The outer loop iterates from 0 to `1e5`, which is a large range and may lead to unnecessary iterations. Since the program is looking for the minimum sum of absolute differences, it is sufficient to iterate up to the maximum array element value.

Based on these observations, the following optimization strategy can be formulated:

1. Move the calculation of the powers of `i` outside the inner loop.
2. Use `ll` for both the array elements and intermediate calculations.
3. Optimize the loop bounds by terminating early when the powers of `i` exceed the maximum array element value.
4. Update the range of `i` in the outer loop to iterate up to the maximum array element value.
