Upon analyzing the given code, we can identify a few potential areas for optimization:

1. Redundant includes: The code includes unnecessary header files (`<random>`, `<bits/stdc++.h>`) that are not used in the code. Removing these includes will reduce the compilation time.

2. Unused functions: There are several functions defined in the code (`checkPrime`, `to_int`, `isPalindrome`, etc.) that are not used anywhere. Removing these unused functions will reduce the code size and improve readability.

3. Inefficient loop: The inner loop in the main function iterates `1e5` times, which is a large number. However, the `sum` variable is checked against `1e18` in every iteration. Since the value of `sum` is increasing with each iteration, it will exceed `1e18` fairly quickly. Therefore, we can optimize this loop by breaking out of it once `sum` exceeds `1e18`.

4. Inefficient power calculation: The code uses the `pow` function to calculate powers of `i` in each iteration of the inner loop. However, the `pow` function involves floating-point calculations, which can be expensive. We can optimize this by using a custom power calculation function that uses integer arithmetic instead.

5. Unnecessary absolute value calculation: The code calculates the absolute difference between `arr[j]` and `pow(i, j)` in each iteration of the inner loop. However, the `pow` function already returns a non-negative value, so taking the absolute value is unnecessary.

To optimize the code, we can follow the following steps:

1. Remove unnecessary includes and functions from the code.

2. Modify the inner loop in the main function to break out once `sum` exceeds `1e18`.

3. Replace the `pow` function with a custom power calculation function that uses integer arithmetic.

4. Remove the unnecessary absolute value calculation in the inner loop.

Here's the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

#define speedUP()                                                              \
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);                                            \
  cin.tie(nullptr);

long long int customPow(int base, int exp) {
  long long int result = 1;
  while (exp > 0) {
    if (exp & 1)
      result *= base;
    base *= base;
    exp >>= 1;
  }
  return result;
}

int main() {
  speedUP();
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  vector<int> arr(n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> arr[i];
  }
  sort(arr.begin(), arr.end());
  long long int ans = 1e18;
  for (int i = 0; i < 1e5; i++) {
    long long int sum = 0;
    int dont = 0;
    for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
      long long int pow_i_j = customPow(i, j);
      if (pow_i_j > 1e18 || sum > 1e18) {
        dont = 1;
        break;
      }
      sum += arr[j] - pow_i_j;
    }
    if (!dont) {
      ans = min(ans, sum);
    }
    if (sum > 1e18) {
      break;
    }
  }
  cout << ans << endl;
}
```

This optimized code improves the efficiency of the original code by removing unnecessary includes, functions, and calculations. It preserves the functionality and output of the original code while reducing memory usage and runtime.
