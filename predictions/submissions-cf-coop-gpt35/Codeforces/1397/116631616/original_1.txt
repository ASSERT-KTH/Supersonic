The given code appears to be a C++ program that calculates the minimum sum of absolute differences between each element of a given array and a power of `i`. The program uses various helper functions and macros for input/output, mathematical calculations, and debugging.

Upon initial analysis, the following potential performance bottlenecks and areas for optimization can be identified:

1. The code includes unnecessary header files, such as `bits/stdc++.h` and `<random>`. It's recommended to include only the necessary headers to reduce compilation time and memory usage.

2. The code uses unnecessary macros and helper functions for printing and debugging (`__print`, `_print`, `debug`, `print`, etc.). These functions can be removed to simplify the code and improve performance.

3. The `isPrime` function uses a naive algorithm to check for prime numbers, which can be optimized using more efficient algorithms like the Sieve of Eratosthenes.

4. The `rotateArray` function has an error in its implementation. The assignment `tmp[i] = arr[(n + i - d) % n];` overwrites the previously assigned value of `tmp[i]`. This issue needs to be fixed to ensure correct rotation of the array.

5. The program uses a brute-force approach to calculate the minimum sum, iterating over a large range of `i` values and calculating the sum for each iteration. This approach is inefficient and can be optimized.

Based on these observations, the following optimization strategy is proposed:

1. Remove unnecessary header files to reduce compilation time and memory usage.

2. Remove unnecessary macros and helper functions for printing and debugging to simplify the code.

3. Optimize the `isPrime` function using a more efficient algorithm like the Sieve of Eratosthenes.

4. Fix the implementation of the `rotateArray` function to correctly rotate the array.

5. Optimize the calculation of the minimum sum by finding a more efficient algorithm or approach.

I will now proceed with implementing these optimization steps and provide a detailed explanation for each step.
