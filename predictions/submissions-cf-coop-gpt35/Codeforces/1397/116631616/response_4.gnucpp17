The given code appears to be solving a problem where we need to find the minimum sum of absolute differences between the elements of a given array and the corresponding powers of a variable `i`. 

Let's analyze the code step by step and identify potential areas of improvement:

1. The code includes unnecessary header files (`<random>`) and macros (`pi`, `ReadInputFile()`, `print2d()`).
2. The code defines a lot of unnecessary helper functions (`checkPrime()`, `to_int()`, `gcd()`, `lcm()`, `sumofDigits()`, `isPalindrome()`, `toBinary()`, `toDecimal()`, `modInverse()`, `NcR()`, `seive()`, `isPowerof2()`, `ceil()`, `rotateArray()`, `kadaneAlgo()`).
3. The code includes a lot of unnecessary debug printing statements and debugging macros.
4. The code uses a `vector<ll>` to store prime numbers up to 1e6, but only uses it to determine whether a number is a prime or not. We can remove this vector entirely and use the `isPrime()` function instead.
5. The code uses the `pow()` function inside a loop, which is computationally expensive. We can optimize this by using repeated multiplication instead of exponentiation.
6. The code performs unnecessary checks for invalid values of `pow(i, j)` and `sum`. These checks can be avoided by using appropriate data types and ranges.
7. The code uses a `vector<int>` to store the input array, but since the elements are being sorted, we can use a more memory-efficient container like `array<int, N>` instead.
8. The code uses a brute-force approach to iterate over values of `i` and calculate the sum for each iteration. This can be optimized by using a more efficient algorithm.

Based on the above analysis, the following optimization strategy can be proposed:

1. Remove unnecessary header files, macros, and helper functions.
2. Remove debug printing statements and macros.
3. Remove the vector `storePrimes` and use the `isPrime()` function instead.
4. Optimize the calculation of `pow(i, j)` by using repeated multiplication.
5. Optimize the loop that calculates the sum by using appropriate data types and ranges.
6. Change the input array container from `vector<int>` to `array<int, N>`.
7. Optimize the algorithm to find the minimum sum.
