Analysis:
1. The code includes unnecessary library headers such as `<bits/stdc++.h>` and `__gcd(a, b)`.
2. The `#define` statements for `gcd` and `lcm` are unnecessary as they are already defined in the `<numeric>` header.
3. The `mem` function is used to initialize an array, but it can be replaced with the `fill` function from the `<algorithm>` header.
4. The `IOS` macro is unnecessary as it is not used in the code.
5. The code uses a loop to calculate the sum of the input array `a` and stores it in `ans`. This can be done more efficiently using the `accumulate` function from the `<numeric>` header.
6. The loop from `c = 1` to `c <= 1000000` is used to calculate the minimum sum. However, the calculation of `pow(c, i)` for each `i` in the loop can be time-consuming. It would be better to calculate the powers of `c` incrementally using a variable.
7. The loop to calculate the sum can be optimized by using the `accumulate` function again.
8. The `min` function can be replaced with a simple comparison to update the minimum value.
9. The `pow` function is used to calculate powers, but it can be replaced with simple multiplication to improve efficiency.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Remove unnecessary library headers.
2. Remove unnecessary `#define` statements.
3. Replace the `mem` function with the `fill` function.
4. Remove the `IOS` macro.
5. Replace the loop to calculate the sum with the `accumulate` function.
6. Replace the loop from `c = 1` to `c <= 1000000` with a loop that calculates the powers incrementally.
7. Optimize the loop to calculate the sum using the `accumulate` function.
8. Replace the `min` function with a simple comparison.
9. Replace the `pow` function with simple multiplication.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Remove unnecessary library headers:
   - Removed the `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` line.
   - Removed the `#include <numeric>` line.

2. Remove unnecessary `#define` statements:
   - Removed the `#define gcd(a, b) __gcd(a, b)` line.
   - Removed the `#define lcm(a, b) a *b / (__gcd(a, b))` line.

3. Replace the `mem` function with the `fill` function:
   - Removed the `mem(a, n)` line.
   - Added the `fill(a, a + n, n)` line.

4. Remove the `IOS` macro:
   - Removed the `IOS` macro.

5. Replace the loop to calculate the sum with the `accumulate` function:
   - Removed the `sum` variable declaration and initialization.
   - Removed the loop to calculate the sum.
   - Replaced the loop with the `accumulate` function: `ans = accumulate(a, a + n, ans);`

6. Replace the loop from `c = 1` to `c <= 1000000` with a loop that calculates the powers incrementally:
   - Declared a variable `power` and initialized it with `1`.
   - Replaced `pow(c, i)` with `power` in the loop.

7. Optimize the loop to calculate the sum using the `accumulate` function:
   - Removed the `sum` variable declaration and initialization.
   - Removed the loop to calculate the sum.
   - Replaced the loop with the `accumulate` function:
     - Calculated the absolute difference between `power` and `a[i]` using a lambda function.
     - Calculated the sum using the `accumulate` function: `sum = accumulate(a, a + n, 0, [&](ll acc, ll x) { return acc + abs(power - x); });`

8. Replace the `min` function with a simple comparison:
   - Replaced `ans = min(ans, sum);` with `if (sum < ans) ans = sum;`

9. Replace the `pow` function with simple multiplication:
   - Replaced `pow(c, i)` with `power *= c;`
