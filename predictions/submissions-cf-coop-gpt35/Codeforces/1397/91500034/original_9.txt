The given code calculates the minimum sum of absolute differences between elements in an array and their corresponding powers of a variable `c`. The code works correctly, but it can be optimized in terms of both time complexity and memory usage.

Here is a step-by-step optimization strategy for the code:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The code includes the entire `<bits/stdc++.h>` header, which is not recommended. Instead, include only the necessary headers, such as `<iostream>` and `<algorithm>`, to reduce compilation time and avoid potential conflicts.

2. Avoid using macros: The code uses macros for functions like `gcd`, `lcm`, and the `rep` loop. Macros can be error-prone and have potential side effects. It is better to use inline functions or constexpr functions instead.

3. Optimize the loop: The current implementation uses a nested loop to calculate the sum of absolute differences for each value of `c`. This results in a time complexity of O(n * 10^6), which can be quite slow for large values of `n`. We can optimize this loop by using mathematical properties.

   - The sum of absolute differences is minimized when each element is equal to the corresponding power of `c`. Therefore, we can initialize `ans` as the sum of the array elements and update it if a smaller sum is found.

   - Instead of calculating `pow(c, i)` in each iteration, we can calculate it once and keep multiplying it by `c` in each iteration. This reduces the number of expensive power calculations.

   - We can stop the loop early if the sum exceeds the current `ans`. Since the array is sorted, once the sum exceeds `ans`, it will only increase further.

4. Use more efficient data types: The code uses `ll` as the data type for array elements and the sum. However, the problem statement does not mention large values, so we can use `int` instead to save memory.

Based on the above optimizations, here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>
#include <cmath>

using namespace std;

const int maxn = 1e5 + 5;

int n, a[maxn];

int main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(nullptr);
  cout.tie(nullptr);

  cin >> n;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> a[i];
  }

  sort(a, a + n);

  int ans = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    ans += a[i];
  }

  int c = 1;
  int sum = 0;
  int pow_c = 1;
  while (sum < ans) {
    sum = 0;
    pow_c = 1;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      sum += abs(pow_c - a[i]);
      pow_c *= c;
      if (sum >= ans) {
        break;
      }
    }
    ans = min(ans, sum);
    c++;
  }

  cout << ans << endl;
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized code reduces unnecessary computations, improves memory usage, and reduces the time complexity of the inner loop to O(n). It should perform significantly better than the original code.
