The given code appears to be a program that calculates the minimum sum of absolute differences between the elements of an array and their corresponding powers of a variable `c`. The program takes an input `n`, followed by `n` integers representing the array elements. It then sorts the array, iterates over different values of `c`, calculates the sum of absolute differences, and updates the minimum sum if a smaller sum is found.

To optimize this code, we can focus on the following areas:
1. Avoid unnecessary function calls.
2. Reduce the number of iterations and computations in the loops.
3. Eliminate unnecessary memory usage.
4. Utilize compiler optimizations.

Now, let's proceed with step-by-step optimizations:

1. Avoid unnecessary function calls:
   - The `gcd` and `lcm` functions are not used in the code. We should remove these function calls and the corresponding macro definitions.

2. Reduce the number of iterations and computations in the loops:
   - The current implementation has a loop that iterates `c` from 1 to 1,000,000. However, we can optimize this loop by considering the range of values in the array. Since the array is sorted, the maximum value `a[n-1]` will be the largest difference. Therefore, we can limit the range of `c` from 1 to `a[n-1]`.
   - Instead of calculating `pow(c, i)` in each iteration, we can maintain a variable `power` that stores the power of `c` and update it by multiplying with `c` in each iteration.

3. Eliminate unnecessary memory usage:
   - The `sum` variable is only used within the loop, so we can move its declaration inside the loop to avoid unnecessary memory usage.

4. Utilize compiler optimizations:
   - We can use compiler optimizations to generate more efficient code. For example, we can use the `-O3` optimization flag when compiling the code, which enables aggressive optimizations.

Here's the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>
#include <cmath>

using namespace std;

const int maxn = 1e5 + 5;

int main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(0);
  cin.tie(0);
  cout.tie(0);

  int n;
  cin >> n;

  int a[maxn];
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> a[i];
  }

  sort(a, a + n);

  int ans = INT_MAX;
  for (int c = 1; c <= a[n-1]; c++) {
    int power = 1;
    int sum = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      sum += abs(power - a[i]);
      power *= c;
      if (sum >= ans)
        break;
    }
    ans = min(ans, sum);
  }

  cout << ans << endl;
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized code removes unnecessary function calls, reduces the number of iterations and computations in the loops, eliminates unnecessary memory usage, and suggests using compiler optimizations. It should provide improved performance and reduced memory usage compared to the original code.
