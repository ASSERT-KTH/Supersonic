Code Analysis:
- The code includes several unnecessary headers, such as `<bits/stdc++.h>` and `<ext/pb_ds/assoc_container.hpp>`.
- There are multiple `using` statements that import namespaces, which can lead to namespace clashes and make the code less readable.
- The code uses several macros instead of explicitly defining the corresponding values, which can make the code harder to understand and debug.
- The code uses a fixed-size array `arr[]` to store the input elements, which can be inefficient for large input sizes.
- The code uses `mii` and `umii` to represent maps, which may not be the most efficient data structure for this problem.
- The code uses two maps, `pre` and `suf`, to store the frequencies of elements before and after each element in the array. This approach requires iterating over the array multiple times and can be optimized.
- The code uses a nested loop to calculate the answer, which can be optimized to reduce the number of iterations.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Remove unnecessary headers and `using` statements to improve compilation time and reduce namespace clashes.
2. Replace macros with explicit values to improve code readability and eliminate potential bugs.
3. Replace the fixed-size array `arr[]` with a dynamic data structure like `vector` to handle large input sizes efficiently.
4. Replace `mii` and `umii` with a more efficient data structure like `unordered_map` to improve performance.
5. Optimize the calculation of `pre` and `suf` maps to eliminate the need for multiple iterations over the array.
6. Optimize the nested loop to reduce the number of iterations and improve performance.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Remove unnecessary headers and `using` statements:
   - Remove `<bits/stdc++.h>` and `<ext/pb_ds/assoc_container.hpp>` headers.
   - Remove `using` statements for `__gnu_pbds` and `std` namespaces.

2. Replace macros with explicit values:
   - Replace `int long long` with `int64_t` to explicitly define the data type.
   - Remove the `mod` macro since it is not being used.

3. Replace fixed-size array with a dynamic data structure:
   - Replace the declaration `int arr[n]` with `vector<int> arr(n)` to use a dynamic array.

4. Replace `mii` and `umii` with `unordered_map`:
   - Replace `mii` with `unordered_map<int, int>` and `umii` with `unordered_map<int, int>`.
   - Update the corresponding variable declarations.

5. Optimize the calculation of `pre` and `suf` maps:
   - Instead of initializing `pre` and `suf` maps with frequencies, initialize them with zero values.
   - Iterate over the array once and update the frequencies in `pre` and `suf` maps.
   - This optimization eliminates the need for multiple iterations over the array.

6. Optimize the nested loop:
   - Instead of using three separate loops, combine the calculations into a single loop.
   - Use two variables, `preCount` and `sufCount`, to keep track of the frequencies before and after the current element.
   - Update the `ans` variable directly inside the loop.
   - This optimization reduces the number of iterations and improves performance.
