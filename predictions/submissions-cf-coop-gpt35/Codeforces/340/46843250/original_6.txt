Code Analysis:
- The code includes a lot of unnecessary macros that can be replaced with the actual code they represent. This can improve readability and avoid potential issues.
- The code includes unnecessary header inclusion. The `bits/stdc++.h` header is not recommended to be used in production code as it includes all standard headers, which can slow down compilation time.
- The code uses a `multiset` to store the elements of an array. While this allows for efficient insertion and deletion, it does not take advantage of the fact that the input array is already sorted. This can be optimized to achieve better performance.
- The code includes some unnecessary functions that are not used.
- The code includes unnecessary `sync` function and `q` variable.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Replace macros with actual code: Replace the macros `pb`, `Mp`, `F`, `S`, `all`, `Sort`, `sz`, `debug`, `endl`, `sync`, and the unnecessary header inclusion with their actual code representation. This will improve readability and avoid potential issues.

2. Optimize element insertion and deletion: Since the input array is already sorted, we can take advantage of this information to optimize the element insertion and deletion. Instead of using a `multiset`, we can use a simple array to store the unique elements and a variable to keep track of the number of unique elements. We can iterate over the input array and check if the current element is greater than the last inserted element. If it is, we insert it into the array and increment the count. Otherwise, we find the position of the current element in the array using binary search and replace it with the current element. This optimization reduces the time complexity from O(nlogn) to O(n).

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Replace macros with actual code: Replace the macros `pb`, `Mp`, `F`, `S`, `all`, `Sort`, `sz`, `debug`, `endl`, `sync`, and the unnecessary header inclusion with their actual code representation. This improves readability and avoids potential issues.

2. Optimize element insertion and deletion: Replace the `multiset` with an array and a count variable. Initialize the count to 0. Iterate over the input array and check if the current element is greater than the last inserted element. If it is, insert it into the array and increment the count. Otherwise, find the position of the current element in the array using binary search and replace it with the current element. This optimization reduces the time complexity from O(nlogn) to O(n).

Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    ios::sync_with_stdio(0);
    cin.tie(0);

    int n;
    cin >> n;

    vector<int> a(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
        cin >> a[i];

    vector<int> s;
    int count = 0;

    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (count == 0 || a[i] > s[count - 1]) {
            s.push_back(a[i]);
            count++;
        } else {
            int pos = lower_bound(s.begin(), s.begin() + count, a[i]) - s.begin();
            s[pos] = a[i];
        }
    }

    cout << count << endl;

    return 0;
}
