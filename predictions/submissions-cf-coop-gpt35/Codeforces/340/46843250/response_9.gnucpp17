After analyzing the given code, the potential areas for optimization are as follows:

1. Remove unnecessary header files: The `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` includes a large number of standard library header files, which can slow down compilation time. We should only include the necessary header files for the specific functionality used in the code.

2. Remove unnecessary macros: The code uses macros for common operations like `pb`, `Mp`, `F`, `S`, etc. These macros can be replaced with regular function calls or inline functions, which can improve the code's readability and reduce the chance of errors.

3. Optimize input/output: The code uses `cin` and `cout` for input and output operations. However, these operations are slower compared to their counterparts, `scanf` and `printf`. By using `scanf` and `printf` instead, we can improve the program's running time.

4. Optimize the data structure: The code uses a `multiset` to store the numbers and keep them sorted. However, `multiset` has a higher time complexity for insertion and deletion operations compared to other data structures like `set` or `vector`. By using a `set` or `vector` instead, we can improve the program's running time.

5. Remove unnecessary functions: The code defines several unnecessary functions like `gcd`, `mod`, and `pow`, which are not used in the main program. Removing these functions can reduce the program's memory usage and improve its running time.

Based on these observations, the following optimization steps can be taken:

1. Remove unnecessary header files: Remove the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header file and include only the necessary standard library headers.

2. Remove unnecessary macros: Replace the macros `pb`, `Mp`, `F`, `S`, `Sort`, `all`, `sz`, and `debug` with regular function calls or inline functions.

3. Optimize input/output: Replace `cin` and `cout` with `scanf` and `printf` for input and output operations.

4. Optimize the data structure: Replace the `multiset` with a `set` or `vector` for storing the numbers.

5. Remove unnecessary functions: Remove the functions `gcd`, `mod`, and `pow` as they are not used in the main program.
