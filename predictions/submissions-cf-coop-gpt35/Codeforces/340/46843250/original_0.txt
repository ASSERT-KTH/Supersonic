The given code seems to implement some kind of algorithm to find the length of the longest increasing subsequence in an array. However, the code contains some unnecessary and inefficient elements that can be optimized to improve its performance. 

1. Remove unnecessary header files: The code includes the `bits/stdc++.h` header file, which includes all the standard library header files. This can result in bloated code and slower compilation times. We should only include the necessary standard library header files instead.

2. Avoid using macros: The code uses several macros, such as `pb`, `Mp`, `F`, `S`, etc., to save typing. However, macros can be error-prone and harder to debug. It is better to use inline functions or constants instead.

3. Avoid using `using namespace std`: The code uses `using namespace std` to avoid typing `std::` before standard library functions and types. While it saves some typing, it can lead to name conflicts and make the code harder to read and maintain. It is better to explicitly qualify the standard library types and functions with `std::`.

4. Avoid unnecessary function overloads: The code includes unnecessary overloaded functions like `gcd` and `mod`. These functions can be replaced with standard library functions to improve performance.

5. Optimize the algorithm: The current algorithm uses a `multiset` to find the length of the longest increasing subsequence. However, we can achieve the same result with a more efficient algorithm that runs in O(nlogn) time complexity.

Based on these observations, here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <set>
#include <algorithm>

int main() {
    std::ios::sync_with_stdio(0);
    std::cin.tie(0);

    int n;
    std::cin >> n;

    std::vector<int> a(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
        std::cin >> a[i];

    std::set<int> s;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        auto it = s.lower_bound(a[i]);
        if (it != s.end())
            s.erase(it);
        s.insert(a[i]);
    }

    std::cout << s.size() << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

This optimized code removes unnecessary macros, uses standard library containers instead of custom ones, and follows best practices for C++ programming. It also uses a more efficient algorithm to find the length of the longest increasing subsequence.
