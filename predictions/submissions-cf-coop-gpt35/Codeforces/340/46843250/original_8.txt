Code Analysis:
- The code includes unnecessary headers that are not used in the program.
- The code uses several macros for convenience, but they are not necessary and can be replaced with their actual implementation.
- The code defines several type aliases for commonly used types, which can be helpful for readability.
- The code includes a few unnecessary functions that are not used in the program.
- The code uses a multiset to store elements and counts the number of distinct elements at the end.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Remove unnecessary headers: The code includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header, which includes all standard C++ headers. This can potentially slow down compilation and increase memory usage. Instead, we should include only the necessary headers that are actually used in the program. In this case, we only need `<iostream>` and `<set>` headers.

2. Replace macros with actual implementation: The code uses several macros for convenience, such as `pb`, `Mp`, `F`, `S`, `all`, `Sort`, `sz`, and `debug`. These macros can be replaced with their actual implementation to avoid the overhead of macro expansion. For example, `pb` can be replaced with `emplace_back`, `Mp` can be replaced with `make_pair`, `F` can be replaced with `first`, `S` can be replaced with `second`, `all` can be replaced with `begin` and `end`, `Sort` can be replaced with `sort`, `sz` can be replaced with `size`, and `debug` can be removed altogether.

3. Remove unnecessary functions: The code includes two unnecessary functions `gcd` and `pow` that are not used in the program. These functions should be removed to reduce the size of the code.

4. Optimize the loop: The code uses a loop to iterate over the array and perform operations on the multiset. This can be optimized by using the `emplace` function instead of `insert` to avoid unnecessary copies or moves of the elements. Additionally, we can use the `erase` function to remove the element pointed by the iterator directly, instead of using `lower_bound` and then erasing the element.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Remove unnecessary headers: Replace the `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` with `#include <iostream>` and `#include <set>`.

2. Replace macros with actual implementation:
   - Replace `pb` with `emplace_back`.
   - Replace `Mp` with `make_pair`.
   - Replace `F` with `first`.
   - Replace `S` with `second`.
   - Replace `all` with `begin` and `end`.
   - Replace `Sort` with `sort`.
   - Replace `sz` with `size`.
   - Remove `debug` macro.

3. Remove unnecessary functions: Remove the `gcd` and `pow` functions.

4. Optimize the loop:
   - Replace `s.insert(a[i])` with `s.emplace(a[i])`.
   - Replace the loop body with `s.erase(s.lower_bound(a[i])); s.emplace(a[i]);`.

const ll MINN = 1e3 + 20;
const ll MOD2 = 998244353ll;
const ll INF = 74592896151251;
const ld EPS = 1e-9;

ll mod(ll n) {
  while (n < 0)
    n += MOD;
  return n % MOD;
}

int Main() {
  ll n;
  cin >> n;
  ll a[MAXN];
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    cin >> a[i];
  multiset<ll> s;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    s.erase(s.lower_bound(a[i]));
    s.emplace(a[i]);
  }
  cout << s.size();
}

int main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(nullptr);
  int q;
  q = 1;
  while (q--)
    Main();
  return 0;
