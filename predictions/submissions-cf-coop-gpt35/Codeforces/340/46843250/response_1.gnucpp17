Analysis:

1. The code includes unnecessary header files such as `bits/stdc++.h` which is not recommended as it includes all the standard library headers, resulting in increased compilation time and unnecessary code bloat.

2. The code uses macros for various functions such as `pb`, `Mp`, `F`, `S`, etc. These macros may result in code bloat and can be replaced with inline functions or regular function calls for better performance.

3. The code uses a `multiset` to store elements and perform operations such as insertion and erasure. While `multiset` provides an ordered container with logarithmic time complexity for insertion and erasure, it is not the most efficient data structure for this particular problem. A better alternative would be to use a `vector` and perform a binary search to find the insertion position.

4. The code uses recursive functions for `pow` and `gcd` calculations. Recursive calls can be expensive in terms of stack space and function call overhead. These recursive functions can be replaced with iterative versions for better performance.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Remove unnecessary header files such as `bits/stdc++.h` and include only the required standard library headers.

2. Replace the macros with inline functions or regular function calls to reduce code bloat.

3. Replace the `multiset` with a `vector` and perform a binary search to find the insertion position of elements.

4. Replace the recursive functions `pow` and `gcd` with iterative versions.
