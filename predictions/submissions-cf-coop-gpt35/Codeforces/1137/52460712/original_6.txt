Code Analysis:
- The code uses several global variables, which can make it difficult to understand and maintain.
- The function `dn` is used to update the value of an integer variable if a condition is satisfied. This can be replaced with a simple if statement.
- The function `gc` is used to read characters from input and skip non-'0' and non-'1' characters. However, it can be simplified by using `cin` and `getchar` functions.
- The code uses a 2D array `open` to store whether a door is open or closed. This can be improved by using a 1D array and calculating the index based on the values of `i` and `j`.
- The code uses a 2D vector `e` to represent a directed graph. This can be replaced with a more efficient data structure, such as an adjacency list.
- The code uses a depth-first search algorithm to find strongly connected components (SCC) in the graph. However, the implementation can be optimized by using Tarjan's algorithm, which has a better time complexity.
- The function `dfsdp` uses a recursive approach to calculate the maximum score. This can be optimized by using dynamic programming and memoization.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Replace global variables with local variables and pass them as function parameters when necessary.
2. Replace the function `dn` with a simple if statement.
3. Simplify the function `gc` by using `cin` and `getchar`.
4. Replace the 2D array `open` with a 1D array.
5. Replace the 2D vector `e` with an adjacency list.
6. Optimize the SCC algorithm by using Tarjan's algorithm.
7. Use dynamic programming and memoization to optimize the function `dfsdp`.

Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. Replace global variables with local variables and pass them as function parameters when necessary.
   - This will improve code readability and make it easier to understand the flow of data.

2. Replace the function `dn` with a simple if statement.
   - The `dn` function can be replaced with a simple if statement to update the value of `x` if `y` is less than `x`.

3. Simplify the function `gc` by using `cin` and `getchar`.
   - Instead of using the `gc` function, we can use `cin` and `getchar` functions to read characters from input and skip non-'0' and non-'1' characters. This will simplify the code and improve efficiency.

4. Replace the 2D array `open` with a 1D array.
   - The 2D array `open` can be replaced with a 1D array by calculating the index based on the values of `i` and `j`. This will reduce memory usage and improve efficiency.

5. Replace the 2D vector `e` with an adjacency list.
   - The 2D vector `e` can be replaced with an adjacency list to represent the directed graph. This will reduce memory usage and improve efficiency.

6. Optimize the SCC algorithm by using Tarjan's algorithm.
   - The current implementation of the SCC algorithm can be optimized by using Tarjan's algorithm, which has a better time complexity. This will improve the efficiency of finding SCCs in the graph.

7. Use dynamic programming and memoization to optimize the function `dfsdp`.
   - The function `dfsdp` can be optimized by using dynamic programming and memoization to avoid redundant computations. This will improve the efficiency of calculating the maximum score.
