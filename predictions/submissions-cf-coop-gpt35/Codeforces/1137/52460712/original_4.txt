The given code appears to solve a graph problem using Strongly Connected Components (SCC) and dynamic programming. However, there are several areas where performance optimizations can be applied to improve the efficiency of the code.

1. Avoiding unnecessary memory usage:
   - The `open` array is a 2D array of size `M`x`55`. Since `M` can be as large as 100,010, this means that the `open` array can occupy a significant amount of memory. However, the problem statement only mentions that the input size can be at most 100,000. Therefore, we can reduce the size of the `open` array to 2D `bool` array of size `M`x`d`, where `d` is the maximum value of `50`.
   
2. Avoiding unnecessary computations:
   - The `getSCC` function computes the Strongly Connected Components (SCC) of the graph. However, the SCCs are only used to build the `escc` array, which is then used in the `dfsdp` function. We can eliminate the need to compute the SCCs by directly building the `escc` array during the initialization of the graph in the `main` function. This can save both time and memory.
   
3. Optimizing memory usage:
   - The `e` and `escc` arrays are currently defined as `vector<int>` arrays. Since the maximum number of elements in these arrays is known in advance, we can consider using fixed-size arrays instead of dynamic vectors to reduce memory allocation and deallocation overhead.

4. Compiler optimizations:
   - We can suggest enabling compiler optimizations, such as loop unrolling or auto-vectorization, to improve the performance of the code. This can be achieved by using compiler-specific pragmas or flags, depending on the compiler being used.

With these optimizations in mind, we can now proceed with implementing the changes to the code.
