The given code appears to be an implementation of a graph algorithm that calculates the maximum score of a path in a directed graph. The graph is represented using adjacency lists, and the algorithm uses the Tarjan's algorithm for finding strongly connected components (SCCs) in the graph.

Here are some potential optimizations that can be applied to improve the efficiency of the code:

1. Avoid redundant memory usage:
   - The `open` array of size `M x (50 + 5)` is used to store boolean values. However, the problem statement states that the values will only be '0' or '1'. Therefore, using a `bool` array instead of a `char` array can reduce memory usage.
   - The `e` and `escc` vectors are initialized with a size of `N` before using them. However, the actual size required can be determined based on the input values. Resizing the vectors to the required size can save memory.

2. Optimize the SCC algorithm:
   - The SCC algorithm can be optimized by using an iterative approach instead of a recursive approach. This can be done by using an explicit stack instead of the function call stack.
   - Instead of using two separate arrays `dfn` and `lowlink` to keep track of the discovery and lowlink values, a single array `lowlink` can be used to store both values.
   - The `instk` array is used to keep track of whether a node is in the stack. However, this information can be obtained from the stack itself by checking if a node is present in the stack.

3. Optimize the dynamic programming algorithm:
   - The `vis` array is used to keep track of whether a node has been visited during the dynamic programming algorithm. However, this information can be obtained from the `dp` array. If a node has a non-zero value in the `dp` array, it has been visited.
   - The `dfsdp` function can be modified to return the maximum score instead of updating the `dp` array. This eliminates the need for the `dp` array and the `vis` array.
   - The `escc` vector can be sorted in reverse order before performing the dynamic programming algorithm. This ensures that the dependencies of a node are processed in the correct order.

4. Compiler optimizations:
   - Enabling compiler optimizations can often lead to significant performance improvements. This can be done by passing appropriate flags to the compiler or by using `#pragma` directives.

Based on these observations, let's proceed with optimizing the code step by step.
