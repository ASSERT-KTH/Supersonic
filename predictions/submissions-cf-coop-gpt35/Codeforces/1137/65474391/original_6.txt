The given code appears to be a C++ program that performs various operations on a tree-like data structure. The program includes functions for initializing the data structure, performing queries on the structure, and simulating updates to the structure.

Upon initial analysis, the following potential areas for optimization can be identified:

1. Memory Usage:
   - The program uses several data structures, including vectors, maps, and sets, to store and manipulate the tree structure. These data structures may result in inefficient memory usage, especially if the size of the tree is large. Consider using more memory-efficient alternatives, such as arrays or custom data structures that are specifically designed for the problem at hand.

2. Redundant Computations:
   - The program includes several loops and recursive calls that may result in redundant computations. These computations can potentially be optimized by eliminating unnecessary iterations or using more efficient algorithms.

3. Loop Unrolling:
   - The program contains multiple loops that iterate over the tree structure. Consider optimizing these loops by unrolling them, which can reduce loop overhead and improve performance.

4. Compiler Optimizations:
   - The code does not include any compiler optimizations or pragma directives that can hint the compiler to optimize certain parts of the code. Consider exploring compiler-specific optimizations, such as loop unrolling, vectorization, or function inlining, to improve the performance of the program.

Based on these observations, the following optimization strategy can be formulated:

1. Replace inefficient data structures:
   - Replace the vector `g` with a more memory-efficient adjacency matrix or a custom data structure that is specifically designed for this problem.
   - Replace the map `col` with an array or a custom data structure that can efficiently store and retrieve values based on their indices.

2. Eliminate redundant computations:
   - Analyze the loops and recursive calls in the code to identify any redundant computations. Eliminate these computations by updating the data structures or using more efficient algorithms.

3. Unroll loops:
   - Identify loops that iterate over the tree structure and optimize them by unrolling the loops. This can reduce loop overhead and improve performance.

4. Add compiler optimizations:
   - Investigate compiler-specific optimizations that can improve the performance of the code. This may include options such as loop unrolling, vectorization, or function inlining.

Now, let's proceed with the step-by-step explanation of each optimization step and provide the optimized code.
