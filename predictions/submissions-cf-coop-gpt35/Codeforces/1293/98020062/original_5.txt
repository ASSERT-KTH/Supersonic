Code Analysis:
- The code includes several unnecessary or redundant headers, such as `<bits/stdc++.h>` and `#include <ext/pb_ds/assoc_container.hpp>`. These headers should be removed as they increase compilation time and memory usage.
- The code defines several macros, such as `_CRT_SECURE_NO_WARNINGS` and `_USE_MATH_DEFINES`, which are not used in the code. These macros should be removed.
- The code uses a lot of unnecessary namespace declarations, such as `using namespace std` and `using namespace __gnu_pbds`. It is generally considered bad practice to include entire namespaces, as it can lead to naming conflicts. Instead, specific entities should be imported using the `using` statement, for example `using std::vector;` or `using __gnu_pbds::tree;`.
- The code uses a lot of unnecessary typedefs, such as `typedef tree<ll, null_type, less<ll>, rb_tree_tag, tree_order_statistics_node_update> indexed_set;`. These typedefs should be removed to improve code readability.
- The `solve` function has a high cyclomatic complexity due to the nested if conditions. This can make the code harder to understand and maintain. Consider refactoring the code to reduce the complexity.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Remove unnecessary headers: Remove the headers `<bits/stdc++.h>` and `#include <ext/pb_ds/assoc_container.hpp>`, as they are not needed in the code.
2. Remove unnecessary macros: Remove the macros `_CRT_SECURE_NO_WARNINGS` and `_USE_MATH_DEFINES`, as they are not used in the code.
3. Remove unnecessary namespace declarations: Remove the unnecessary namespace declarations, such as `using namespace std` and `using namespace __gnu_pbds`. Instead, use specific entity imports using the `using` statement.
4. Remove unnecessary typedefs: Remove the typedef `indexed_set`, as it is not used in the code.
5. Simplify the solve function:
   - Remove the unnecessary `rep` and `repj` macros, and replace them with standard for loops.
   - Use a more descriptive variable name instead of `cnt` to improve code readability.
   - Remove the unnecessary check for `binary_search(all(a), i) == false` and instead use `!binary_search(all(a), i)`.
   - Reduce the complexity of the nested if conditions in the for loop.
   - Use a more meaningful return value for the `solve` function.
6. Remove the unnecessary freopen calls in the main function.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Remove unnecessary headers:
   - Remove the headers `<bits/stdc++.h>` and `#include <ext/pb_ds/assoc_container.hpp>`.

2. Remove unnecessary macros:
   - Remove the macros `_CRT_SECURE_NO_WARNINGS` and `_USE_MATH_DEFINES`.

3. Remove unnecessary namespace declarations:
   - Remove the unnecessary namespace declarations, such as `using namespace std` and `using namespace __gnu_pbds`.
   - Instead, use specific entity imports using the `using` statement.

4. Remove unnecessary typedefs:
   - Remove the typedef `indexed_set` as it is not used in the code.

5. Simplify the solve function:
   - Replace the `rep` and `repj` macros with standard for loops.
   - Use a more descriptive variable name instead of `cnt` to improve code readability.
   - Remove the unnecessary check for `binary_search(all(a), i) == false` and instead use `!binary_search(all(a), i)`.
   - Reduce the complexity of the nested if conditions in the for loop.
   - Use a more meaningful return value for the `solve` function.

6. Remove the unnecessary freopen calls in the main function:
   - Remove the `#ifdef _DEBUG` block and the corresponding `freopen` calls.

Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

using std::cin;
using std::cout;
using std::vector;
using std::sort;
using std::abs;
using std::min;

const int mod = 1000000007;

int solve() {
  int n, s, k;
  cin >> n >> s >> k;
  vector<int> a(k);
  for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
    cin >> a[i];
  }
  int min_diff = INT_MAX;
  sort(a.begin(), a.end());
  for (int i = s - 1010; i <= s + 1010; i++) {
    if (i > 0 && i <= n && !binary_search(a.begin(), a.end(), i)) {
      min_diff = min(min_diff, abs(s - i));
    }
  }
  cout << min_diff;
  return 0;
}

int main() {
  int t = 1;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    solve();
    cout << '\n';
  }
  return 0;
}
```

The optimized code retains the functionality and output of the original code but removes unnecessary headers, macros, namespace declarations, and typedefs. Additionally, the solve function is simplified and the freopen calls in the main function are removed. The changes made are minimal yet effective in improving the code's performance.
