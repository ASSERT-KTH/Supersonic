Upon analyzing the code, here are some potential optimizations that can be made:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The code includes several unnecessary headers, such as `<bits/stdc++.h>` and headers from the `__gnu_pbds` library. These unnecessary includes can be removed to improve compilation time.

2. Avoid using namespace std: While it may be convenient to use the `using namespace std;` directive, it is generally considered bad practice as it pollutes the global namespace. Instead, it is better to explicitly qualify the standard library types and functions when using them (e.g., `std::vector`, `std::sort`, etc.).

3. Avoid unnecessary type aliases: The code defines multiple type aliases (e.g., `int`, `ll`, `ld`, etc.), which can lead to confusion and make the code less readable. It is better to use standard types directly (e.g., `long long`, `long double`, etc.) to improve code clarity.

4. Avoid unnecessary macros: The code defines several unnecessary macros (e.g., `endl`, `tolower`, `toupper`, etc.) that can be replaced with their corresponding standard functions or constants. This can improve code readability and avoid potential issues.

5. Use more descriptive variable names: The code uses short and unclear variable names (e.g., `n`, `s`, `k`, etc.), which can make the code harder to understand. It is better to use more descriptive variable names to improve code readability.

6. Avoid unnecessary vector copies: The code copies the vector `a` using the `all(a)` macro in the `sort` function and the `binary_search` function. This can be avoided by passing the iterators directly.

7. Optimize the binary search loop: The binary search loop can be optimized by using a more efficient search range. Instead of searching from `s - 1010` to `s + 1010`, we can limit the search range to `max(1LL, s - 1010)` to `min(n, s + 1010)`. This avoids unnecessary iterations and improves performance.

8. Use a more efficient data structure: The code uses a `vector` for storing the values of `a` and performs a binary search on it. However, since the values in `a` are sorted, we can use a binary search directly on the sorted vector without the need for a separate data structure. This can improve performance by avoiding unnecessary memory allocations and lookups.

With these optimizations in mind, here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>
#include <vector>

const long long hell = 1000000007;
const long long mod = 1000000007;

long long solve() {
  long long n, s, k;
  std::cin >> n >> s >> k;
  std::vector<long long> a(k);
  for (long long i = 0; i < k; i++) {
    std::cin >> a[i];
  }
  long long cnt = INT_MAX;
  std::sort(a.begin(), a.end());
  for (long long i = std::max(1LL, s - 1010); i <= std::min(n, s + 1010); i++) {
    if (!std::binary_search(a.begin(), a.end(), i)) {
      cnt = std::min(cnt, std::abs(s - i));
    }
  }
  std::cout << cnt;
  return 0;
}

int main() {
  std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  std::cin.tie(0);
  std::cout.tie(0);

#ifdef _DEBUG
  freopen("input.txt", "r", stdin);
  freopen("output.txt", "w", stdout);
#endif

  long long t = 1;
  std::cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    solve();
    std::cout << std::endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```

These optimizations aim to improve code clarity, reduce unnecessary computations, and minimize memory usage. They do not significantly change the structure or functionality of the original code.
