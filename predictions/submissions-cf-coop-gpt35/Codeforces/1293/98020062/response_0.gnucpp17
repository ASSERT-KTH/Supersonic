Code Analysis:
- The code includes several unnecessary includes, such as `<bits/stdc++.h>` and `<ext/pb_ds/assoc_container.hpp>`.
- There are multiple unnecessary `using` statements.
- The code uses macros for some commonly used data types (`int`, `ll`, `ld`) but also uses `long long` explicitly in some places.
- The code uses a lot of unnecessary utility functions, such as `pb`, `pp`, `mp`, `all`, `rall`, `tolower`, `toupper`, `rep`, `repj`, `lexistr`.
- The code uses the `endl` manipulator, which flushes the buffer after each output, causing unnecessary overhead.
- The code uses a custom `solve()` function instead of directly implementing the logic in the `main()` function.
- The `solve()` function sorts the input array `a` unnecessarily.
- The `solve()` function uses a loop to search for the minimum absolute difference, which can be done more efficiently.
- The code reads the number of test cases from input but does not utilize it effectively.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Remove unnecessary includes and using statements.
2. Remove unnecessary macros and use `long long` consistently.
3. Remove unnecessary utility functions.
4. Remove the `solve()` function and implement the logic directly in the `main()` function.
5. Optimize the search for the minimum absolute difference by using a binary search algorithm instead of a loop.
6. Utilize the number of test cases effectively by using a `for` loop instead of a `while` loop.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Remove unnecessary includes and using statements:
   - The includes `<bits/stdc++.h>` and `<ext/pb_ds/assoc_container.hpp>` are not needed and can be removed.
   - The `using` statements for `std` and `__gnu_pbds` are not necessary and can be removed.

2. Remove unnecessary macros and use `long long` consistently:
   - The macros `int`, `ll`, and `ld` are not needed and can be removed.
   - Replace `long long` with `int` consistently throughout the code.

3. Remove unnecessary utility functions:
   - Remove the macros `pb`, `pp`, `mp`, `all`, `rall`, `tolower`, `toupper`, `rep`, `repj`, `lexistr`.
   - Remove the `endl` manipulator and use `'\n'` instead.

4. Remove the `solve()` function and implement the logic directly in the `main()` function:
   - Move the logic from the `solve()` function directly into the `main()` function.
   - Remove the `solve()` function declaration and call.

5. Optimize the search for the minimum absolute difference:
   - Instead of using a loop to search for the minimum absolute difference, use the `lower_bound()` function to perform a binary search on the sorted array `a`.
   - Calculate the minimum absolute difference by comparing the element found using `lower_bound()` with the current minimum difference.

6. Utilize the number of test cases effectively:
   - Use a `for` loop instead of a `while` loop to iterate over the number of test cases.
