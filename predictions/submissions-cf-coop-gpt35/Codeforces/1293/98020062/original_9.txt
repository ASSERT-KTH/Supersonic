Upon analyzing the given code, I have identified several potential optimizations:

1. Unnecessary header files: The code includes several unnecessary header files such as `<bits/stdc++.h>`, `<ext/pb_ds/assoc_container.hpp>`, and `<ext/pb_ds/tree_policy.hpp>`. These header files are not used in the code and can be removed.

2. Excessive macros: The code defines several macros that are not used or can be replaced with simpler alternatives. For example, the macros `int` and `ll` are defined but never used. Additionally, the macro `endl` is used to print a newline character, but using `'\n'` directly is more efficient.

3. Redundant data structures: The code uses a `vector` to store the values of `a` but never performs any operations that require random access or resizing of the vector. Instead, a `set` or `unordered_set` can be used to store the values, allowing for efficient searching and insertion.

4. Unnecessary loop variables: The loop variables `i` and `j` in the `rep` and `repj` macros are not used within the loop body. These variables can be removed to improve code readability.

5. Inefficient search algorithm: The code uses the `binary_search` function to check if a value exists in the `a` vector. However, since the vector is sorted, a more efficient search algorithm, such as binary search, can be used to find the closest value to `s`.

Based on these observations, I propose the following optimization strategy:

1. Remove unnecessary header files.
2. Remove unused macros and replace `endl` with `'\n'`.
3. Replace the `vector` with a `set` or `unordered_set` to store the values of `a`.
4. Remove unused loop variables from the `rep` and `repj` macros.
5. Implement a more efficient search algorithm to find the closest value to `s`.

Now, I will provide the optimized code block with step-by-step explanations of each optimization:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <set>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

const int mod = 1000000007;

int solve() {
    int n, s, k;
    cin >> n >> s >> k;
    set<int> a; // Use a set instead of a vector
    for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
        int x;
        cin >> x;
        a.insert(x);
    }
    int cnt = INT_MAX;
    for (int i = s - 1010; i <= s + 1010; i++) {
        if (i > 0 && i <= n && a.find(i) == a.end()) {
            cnt = min(cnt, abs(s - i));
        }
    }
    cout << cnt << '\n'; // Use '\n' instead of endl
    return 0;
}

int main() {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(0);
    cout.tie(0);
    int t;
    cin >> t;
    while (t--) {
        solve();
    }
    return 0;
}
```

Explanation of optimizations:

1. Removed unnecessary header files: The code no longer includes unnecessary header files, which improves compilation time.

2. Removed unused macros and replaced `endl` with `'\n'`: The code no longer defines unused macros, reducing clutter and improving code readability. `'\n'` is used instead of `endl` to avoid unnecessary flushing of the output stream, resulting in a performance improvement.

3. Replaced `vector` with `set`: Instead of using a `vector` to store the values of `a`, a `set` is used. This allows for efficient searching and insertion, improving the overall performance of the code.

4. Removed unused loop variables: The loop variables `i` and `j` in the `rep` and `repj` macros are removed since they are not used within the loop body. This simplifies the code and improves readability.

5. Implemented a more efficient search algorithm: Instead of using `binary_search`, the code now uses `set::find` to check if a value exists in the set. This is more efficient since the set is already sorted and provides a faster search operation.

Overall, these optimizations improve the efficiency of the code by reducing unnecessary operations, using more efficient data structures, and implementing faster search algorithms.
