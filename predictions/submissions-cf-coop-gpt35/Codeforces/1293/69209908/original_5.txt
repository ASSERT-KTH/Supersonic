The provided code calculates the maximum number of steps that can be taken from a starting point `(xx, yy)` to a target point `(xs, ys)` within a given time `t`. The movement from one point to the next is determined by the equations `x = ax * x + bx` and `y = ay * y + by`, where `x` and `y` are the coordinates of the current point.

Upon analyzing the code, the following potential optimizations can be identified:

1. Eliminate unnecessary includes: The code includes the entire `bits/stdc++.h` header, which is not recommended as it includes a large number of unnecessary headers. Instead, include only the necessary headers such as `<iostream>` and `<vector>`.

2. Remove unnecessary macros: The macros `FAST`, `ll`, `pb`, `ff`, and `ss` are not used in the code and can be removed.

3. Avoid unnecessary function calls: The `dist` function is called multiple times within the main loop. Instead of calling the function repeatedly, store the result in a variable and reuse it.

4. Optimize vector usage: The vector `arr` is used to store the visited points. Instead of using a vector, a deque or a linked list would be more efficient for insertion and deletion at both ends.

5. Optimize loop calculations: The loop that calculates the maximum number of steps can be optimized to avoid unnecessary calculations. For example, the `dus` variable can be reused instead of recalculating it in each iteration.

6. Use integer arithmetic instead of floating-point arithmetic: The `dist` function currently uses `abs` to calculate the Manhattan distance. Since the coordinates are integers, it would be more efficient to use integer arithmetic instead.

Based on these optimizations, the following optimized code is proposed:
