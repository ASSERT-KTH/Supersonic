The given code calculates the maximum number of points that can be reached within a given time constraint. However, there are several areas where the code can be optimized for efficiency:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The code includes the entire `<bits/stdc++.h>` header, which is not recommended as it increases compilation time and memory usage. Instead, include only the necessary headers, such as `<iostream>`, `<vector>`, and `<algorithm>`.

2. Remove unnecessary macros: The macros `FAST`, `ll`, `pb`, `ff`, `ss` are not used in the code and can be removed.

3. Improve variable naming: The variable names used in the code are not descriptive and make it difficult to understand the purpose of the variables. Consider using more descriptive variable names that convey their purpose.

4. Optimize the `dist` function: The `dist` function calculates the Manhattan distance between two points using the `abs` function. Instead of using `abs`, we can use the bitwise OR operator (`|`) to calculate the absolute value of the difference between the coordinates. This is faster than using the `abs` function.

5. Optimize the `next` function: The `next` function calculates the next point based on a given point and the provided coefficients. This function can be optimized by using a loop instead of recursion. This will reduce the function call overhead and improve performance.

6. Avoid unnecessary vector resizing: The code uses `vector::push_back()` to add elements to the `arr` vector. This can cause frequent reallocation and resizing of the vector, which can be inefficient. Instead, reserve enough space in the vector upfront to avoid unnecessary resizing.

7. Optimize the loop for calculating `ans`: The loop that calculates the maximum number of points can be optimized by avoiding repeated calculations. The current implementation recalculates the distance between points multiple times, which can be avoided by storing the distances in a separate array.

8. Use pre-increment instead of post-increment: In the loop where `j` is incremented and decremented, use pre-increment (`++j`) instead of post-increment (`j++`). Pre-increment is faster and does not involve creating a temporary copy of the variable.

9. Use `size_t` for loop indices: The loop indices should be of type `size_t` instead of `int`, as `size_t` is guaranteed to be able to represent the maximum size of a container.

10. Use `reserve` for the `arr` vector: The `arr` vector can have a large number of elements. Reserving space for the vector upfront using the `reserve` function can improve performance by avoiding frequent reallocation.

With these optimizations in mind, let's proceed with the code optimization.
