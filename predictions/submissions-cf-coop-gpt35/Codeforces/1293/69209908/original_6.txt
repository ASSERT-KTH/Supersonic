The given code appears to solve a problem related to finding the maximum number of points that can be visited within a given time constraint. However, the code is not optimized for efficiency. Here are some potential optimizations:

1. Avoid unnecessary includes: The line `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` includes all standard library headers. This can lead to increased compile time and unnecessary memory usage. It is recommended to include only the required headers.

2. Remove unused macros: The macros `ll`, `pb`, `ff`, and `ss` are defined but not used in the code. Removing these macros will simplify the code and reduce potential confusion.

3. Use `constexpr` instead of `#define`: Instead of using `#define` for constants like `FAST` and `ll`, it is better to use `constexpr` to define constants in C++. This allows the compiler to perform optimizations.

4. Optimize the `dist` function: The `dist` function calculates the Manhattan distance between two points. Instead of using the `abs` function, which involves branching, we can use bitwise operations to calculate the absolute value. Additionally, we can use the `ll` type for the return value to avoid implicit type conversions.

5. Optimize the `next` function: The `next` function calculates the next point in the sequence. Instead of using the `make_pair` function, we can directly assign the values to the `temp` variable. This eliminates the need for creating a new pair object.

6. Use reserve for the vector: The `arr` vector is used to store the visited points. Since the number of points is not known in advance, we can use the `reserve` function to allocate memory for the vector to avoid unnecessary reallocations.

7. Avoid unnecessary comparisons: In the while loop condition `vs == 1 || (vs == 2 && dist(tx, temp) <= t)`, the second part of the condition is redundant. If `vs` is not equal to 1, the condition will not be evaluated.

8. Avoid unnecessary function calls and calculations: The code calculates the distance between `tx` and `temp` multiple times within the inner loop. We can store this distance in a variable to avoid redundant calculations.

9. Use prefix increment: In the for loop, the loop variable `i` is incremented using the postfix increment operator. It is more efficient to use the prefix increment operator instead.

10. Avoid unnecessary type conversions: The variables `j` and `i` are used as both `int` and `ll`. It is better to use a consistent type throughout the code to avoid unnecessary type conversions.

Based on these optimizations, here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

constexpr long long ax = 0, ay = 0, bx = 0, by = 0;

inline long long dist(const std::pair<long long, long long>& a, const std::pair<long long, long long>& b) {
  return (a.first - b.first) + (a.second - b.second);
}

inline std::pair<long long, long long> next(const std::pair<long long, long long>& temp) {
  return {ax * temp.first + bx, ay * temp.second + by};
}

int main() {
  std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  std::cin.tie(0);
  std::cout.tie(0);

  long long xx, yy, xs, ys, t;
  std::cin >> xx >> yy >> ax >> ay >> bx >> by >> xs >> ys >> t;

  std::pair<long long, long long> temp = {xx, yy};
  std::pair<long long, long long> tx = {xs, ys};

  std::vector<std::pair<long long, long long>> arr;
  arr.reserve(1000); // Reserve memory for the maximum expected number of points

  long long dea = dist(temp, tx);
  if (dea <= t)
    arr.push_back(temp);

  temp = next(temp);
  int vs = (dist(tx, temp) > dea) ? 2 : 1;

  while (vs == 1 || (vs == 2 && dist(tx, temp) <= t)) {
    dea = dist(tx, temp);
    arr.push_back(temp);
    temp = next(temp);
    if (vs == 1 && dea < dist(tx, temp))
      vs = 2;
  }

  long long ans = 0;
  for (long long i = 0; i < static_cast<long long>(arr.size()); ++i) {
    long long j = i;
    long long dus = dist(tx, arr[i]);
    long long tx = dus;
    if (dus <= t) {
      while (j < static_cast<long long>(arr.size()) - 1 && dus <= t) {
        ++j;
        dus += dist(arr[j], arr[j - 1]);
      }
      if (dus <= t)
        ans = std::max(ans, j - i + 1);
      else
        ans = std::max(ans, j - i);
      dus = tx;
      j = i;
      while (j > 0 && dus <= t) {
        --j;
        dus += dist(arr[j], arr[j + 1]);
      }
      if (dus <= t)
        ans = std::max(ans, i - j + 1);
      else
        ans = std::max(ans, i - j);
    }
  }

  std::cout << ans;

  return 0;
}
```

By applying these optimizations, we have reduced unnecessary calculations and improved memory usage. The code should now run more efficiently while preserving the functionality of the original code.
