The provided code appears to be a C++ program that calculates the maximum number of steps a character can take within a given time limit, based on a certain set of rules. The program uses a combination of loops, conditionals, and mathematical calculations to determine the maximum number of steps.

To optimize this code, we will focus on the following areas:

1. Avoid unnecessary library inclusions: The `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` statement includes a large number of standard C++ libraries. However, this can result in slower compilation times and unnecessary memory usage. Instead, only include the necessary libraries for the code.

2. Improve variable naming: The code uses variable names that are not descriptive, such as `xx`, `yy`, `vs`, and `dus`. These names make it difficult to understand the purpose of the variables. We will replace these names with more meaningful ones.

3. Optimize the `dist` function: The `dist` function calculates the Manhattan distance between two points. However, it can be optimized by using bitwise operations instead of the `abs` function, as bitwise operations are generally faster.

4. Optimize the `next` function: The `next` function calculates the next point based on the given rules. However, it can be optimized by eliminating the use of the `make_pair` function and using direct assignment instead.

5. Optimize the loop conditions: The loop conditions can be optimized to reduce unnecessary calculations. For example, instead of calculating `dist(tx, temp)` multiple times, it can be calculated once and stored in a variable.

6. Optimize the loop iterations: The loop iterations can be optimized to reduce the number of iterations and improve performance. For example, instead of iterating through the entire `arr` vector, we can start the loop from the previous position where the maximum number of steps was found.

7. Optimize the calculation of the maximum number of steps: The calculation of the maximum number of steps can be simplified by using a single loop instead of two separate loops.

8. Use `reserve` for vector memory allocation: The `arr` vector is dynamically resized during the execution of the program. To improve performance, we can use the `reserve` function to preallocate memory for the vector.
