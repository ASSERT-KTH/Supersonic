Code Analysis:
- The code starts by importing the necessary libraries and defining some macros.
- It then defines a function `dist` to calculate the Manhattan distance between two points.
- The `next` function calculates the next point in the sequence based on the given linear equation.
- In the main function, the input values are read and stored in variables.
- A vector `arr` is initialized to store the points that satisfy the given condition.
- The code then iteratively calculates the points in the sequence and checks if they satisfy the condition.
- Finally, the code calculates the maximum number of points that can be visited within the given time constraint and prints the result.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Avoid unnecessary imports and macros: The code includes the `bits/stdc++.h` header, which is not recommended as it includes a large number of unnecessary libraries. We can replace it with the specific headers required for the code.
2. Avoid unnecessary function calls: The `abs` function is called in the `dist` function, which can be replaced with the bitwise `&` operation for faster execution.
3. Optimize loop conditions: The loop condition `vs == 1 || (vs == 2 && dist(tx, temp) <= t)` is evaluated in each iteration. We can optimize this condition by breaking the loop when `vs` becomes 2 and `dist(tx, temp)` exceeds `t`.
4. Optimize vector operations: Instead of repeatedly pushing elements to the vector `arr`, we can reserve the required space beforehand to avoid frequent reallocation of memory.
5. Use integer arithmetic instead of floating point: The code uses `ll` (long long) for calculating distances. We can optimize this by using integer arithmetic instead of floating point operations.
6. Optimize loop iteration: The loop iterates over the vector `arr` using an index variable `i`. We can optimize this by using iterators instead of indices, which can improve performance.
7. Use pre-increment instead of post-increment: The loop variable `j` is currently incremented using post-increment (`j++`). We can optimize this by using pre-increment (`++j`), which avoids the creation of a temporary variable.
8. Use `emplace_back` instead of `push_back`: Instead of using `push_back` to add elements to the vector `arr`, we can use `emplace_back` to construct the elements in-place, which can improve performance.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Remove unnecessary imports and macros:
   - Replace `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` with the specific headers required for the code.
   - Remove the macros `FAST`, `ll`, `pb`, `ff`, `ss` as they are not used in the code.

2. Optimize `dist` function:
   - Replace `abs(a.ff - b.ff) + abs(a.ss - b.ss)` with `(a.ff - b.ff) & (a.ss - b.ss)` in the `dist` function.

3. Optimize loop condition:
   - Modify the loop condition `vs == 1 || (vs == 2 && dist(tx, temp) <= t)` to `vs == 1 || (vs == 2 && dist(tx, temp) <= t && temp != tx)`.

4. Optimize vector operations:
   - Before the loop, add `arr.reserve(100000)` to reserve the required space for the vector `arr`.

5. Use integer arithmetic:
   - Replace `ll` with `int` in the declaration of variables `xx`, `yy`, `ax`, `ay`, `bx`, `by`, `xs`, `ys`, `t`, `vs`, `ans`.
   - Replace `ll dus = dist(tx, arr[i])` with `int dus = dist(tx, arr[i])` in the loop.

6. Optimize loop iteration:
   - Replace `for (int i = 0; i < arr.size(); i++)` with `for (auto it = arr.begin(); it != arr.end(); ++it)`.

7. Use pre-increment instead of post-increment:
   - Replace `j++` with `++j` in the two inner loops.

8. Use `emplace_back` instead of `push_back`:
   - Replace `arr.push_back(temp)` with `arr.emplace_back(temp)` in the loop.
