Code Analysis:
1. The code reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and creates a vector `v` of size `n` to store `n` integers.
3. It also creates a vector `cnt` of size `2e5 + 1` to count the frequency of each integer in `v`.
4. It then sorts the vector `v`.
5. It creates another vector `dp` of size `2e5 + 1` to store the maximum count of integers that are divisible by a prime number.
6. It iterates over `dp` and for each index `i`, it checks if `cnt[i]` is non-zero.
   - If `cnt[i]` is zero, it skips to the next iteration.
   - Otherwise, it iterates from `2` to the square root of `i` and checks if `i` is divisible by `j`.
   - If `i` is divisible by `j`, it updates `dp[i]` to the maximum of `dp[i]`, `dp[j]`, and `dp[i/j]`.
   - It then updates `dp[i]` to the maximum of `dp[i]` and `dp[1]`.
   - Finally, it adds the count of `i` in `cnt` to `dp[i]` and updates the `best` value to the maximum of `best` and `dp[i]`.
7. It prints the difference between `n` and `best` for each test case.

Optimization Strategy:
1. The code uses vectors to store the frequency of each integer and the maximum count. However, since the maximum value is fixed at `2e5 + 1`, we can use an array instead of a vector to reduce memory usage and improve cache locality.
2. The code uses `sqrt` function in the inner loop to iterate from `2` to the square root of `i`. This can be optimized by precalculating the square root of each number and storing it in an array.
3. The code uses nested loops to iterate over the `dp` vector. This can be optimized by using a single loop with a stack to store the indices that need to be processed.
4. The code uses the `max` function multiple times to update the maximum value. This can be optimized by using a variable to store the maximum value and update it directly.
5. The code sorts the input vector `v`. Since the values in `v` are already counted in `cnt`, sorting is not necessary and can be removed.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Replace the vector `cnt` with an array `cnt` of size `2e5 + 1`.
   - This reduces memory usage and improves cache locality.
2. Create an array `sqrtArr` of size `2e5 + 1` to store the square root of each number.
   - This avoids calculating the square root in the inner loop.
   - Initialize `sqrtArr[i]` with `sqrt(i)` for each `i` from `1` to `2e5`.
3. Replace the vector `dp` with an array `dp` of size `2e5 + 1`.
   - This reduces memory usage and improves cache locality.
4. Remove the sorting of vector `v`.
   - The values in `v` are already counted in `cnt`, so sorting is not necessary.
5. Replace the nested loops with a single loop.
   - Use a stack to store the indices that need to be processed.
   - Pop an index from the stack and update `dp[i]` for that index.
   - Push the indices that need to be processed in the next iteration.
6. Replace the multiple calls to `max` with a variable `maxVal`.
   - Update `maxVal` directly instead of using the `max` function.
7. Update the `best` value using `maxVal`.
8. Print the difference between `n` and `best` for each test case.

```

The optimized code reduces memory usage by using arrays instead of vectors and improves cache locality. It also removes unnecessary sorting and optimizes the inner loop by precalculating the square root values and using a single loop with a stack. The maximum value is updated directly instead of using the `max` function multiple times. These optimizations improve the efficiency of the code.
