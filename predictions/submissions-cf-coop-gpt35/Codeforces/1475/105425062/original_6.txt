Code Analysis:
- The code reads an integer `t` as the number of test cases.
- For each test case, it reads an integer `n`, followed by `n` integers into a vector `v`.
- It then counts the frequency of each number in `v` using a vector `cnt`.
- The code sorts the vector `v` in ascending order.
- It initializes a vector `dp` with zeros.
- It iterates over the numbers in `cnt` and calculates the maximum number of occurrences for each number `i` by checking its divisors. It updates the `dp` vector accordingly.
- Finally, it prints the difference between `n` and the maximum value in `dp`.

Potential Optimizations:
1. The `cnt` vector can have a maximum size of `2e5 + 1`, which may consume a significant amount of memory. However, since the values in `v` are limited to `2e5`, we can reduce the size of the `cnt` vector to `2e5`.
2. The current implementation uses nested loops to iterate over the numbers in `cnt` and calculate the maximum number of occurrences. This approach has a time complexity of O(n * sqrt(n)). We can optimize this by using a more efficient algorithm to calculate the maximum occurrences.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Reduce the size of the `cnt` vector from `2e5 + 1` to `2e5`.
2. Use a more efficient algorithm to calculate the maximum number of occurrences for each number `i` in the `cnt` vector.

Step-by-Step Explanation of Optimization Steps:
1. Reduce the size of the `cnt` vector from `2e5 + 1` to `2e5`. This reduces the memory usage of the program without affecting its functionality. Update the line `vector<long long> cnt(2e5 + 1, 0);` to `vector<long long> cnt(2e5, 0);`.

2. Use a more efficient algorithm to calculate the maximum number of occurrences for each number `i` in the `cnt` vector. Instead of iterating over all possible divisors, we can use a modified sieve algorithm to calculate the maximum number of occurrences for each number.

   - Initialize a vector `isPrime` of size `2e5` with all elements set to `true`.
   - Initialize a vector `spf` (smallest prime factor) of size `2e5` with all elements set to `0`.
   - Iterate from 2 to the square root of `2e5`:
     - If `isPrime[i]` is `true`, it means `i` is a prime number. Set `spf[i] = i`.
     - Mark all multiples of `i` as non-prime and set their smallest prime factor as `i` (`spf[j] = i`).
   - Iterate from 2 to `2e5`:
     - If `spf[i]` is `0`, it means `i` is a prime number. Set `spf[i] = i`.
   - Update the outer loop to iterate over the unique elements in `v` instead of `cnt`.
   - Calculate the maximum number of occurrences for each unique element `i` in `v` using the modified sieve algorithm.

The optimized code reduces the memory usage by using a smaller size for the `cnt` vector. It also improves the time complexity of calculating the maximum number of occurrences by using a modified sieve algorithm. These optimizations should result in improved performance and reduced memory consumption compared to the original code.
