To optimize the given code, we can focus on the following aspects:

1. Reducing memory usage: The given code uses three-dimensional arrays `multree` and `addtree` to store values. These arrays have dimensions `mxn`x`mxn`x2. However, the maximum value of `n` is 1010. Since the code only accesses elements up to `n`, we can reduce the size of these arrays to `nxn`x2.

2. Removing unnecessary code: The code includes a large number of preprocessor macros and functions that are not used in the given program. We can remove these unused macros and functions to simplify the code and improve readability.

3. Removing unnecessary data structures: The code includes several data structures such as vectors, maps, and sets that are not used in the given program. We can remove these unnecessary data structures to reduce memory usage and improve performance.

4. Optimizing loops: The code includes nested loops for querying and updating the `multree` and `addtree` arrays. We can optimize these loops by using loop unrolling and reducing the loop iterations where possible.

5. Simplifying mathematical operations: The code includes complex mathematical operations such as xor and multiplication that can be simplified to improve performance.

Based on these optimization strategies, we can now proceed with the step-by-step explanation and the optimized code.
