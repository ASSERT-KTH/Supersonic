The given code is a C++ program that performs queries and updates on a 2D matrix. The matrix is represented by two trees, `multree` and `addtree`, which store the elements of the matrix in a compressed form. The program reads the number of rows and columns of the matrix, followed by a series of queries. Each query can either be a range query or an update query. 

The optimization strategy for this code can include the following steps:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The code includes several unnecessary headers, such as `<bits/stdc++.h>` and `<ext/pb_ds/assoc_container.hpp>`. These headers are not used in the code and can be removed.

2. Remove unnecessary definitions: The code defines several macros and aliases that are not used. These definitions can be removed to simplify the code.

3. Optimize the tree data structure: The trees `multree` and `addtree` can be optimized to reduce memory usage and improve performance. Currently, each element of the trees is a 2D array of size `mxn` by `mxn`. However, only a small portion of this array is actually used. We can optimize the trees by using a dynamic data structure, such as a map, to store only the non-zero elements of the matrix. This will reduce memory usage and improve the efficiency of the tree operations.

4. Optimize the query and update functions: The current implementation of the query and update functions iterates over the elements of the matrix using nested loops. This can be optimized by using the optimized tree data structure from the previous step. The query and update functions can be modified to perform the required operations directly on the optimized trees, avoiding unnecessary iterations.

5. Optimize I/O operations: The code currently uses `cin` and `cout` for input and output operations. These operations can be slow for large inputs and outputs. To improve performance, we can use faster I/O methods, such as `scanf` and `printf`, for input and output operations.

Let's proceed with the step-by-step explanation of each optimization step:
