The given code appears to be a solution to a problem that involves performing range updates and range queries on a 2D grid. The code uses a Fenwick tree data structure to efficiently handle these operations.

Upon analyzing the code, the following potential optimizations can be identified:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The code includes several unnecessary header files, such as `<ext/pb_ds/assoc_container.hpp>` and `<ext/pb_ds/tree_policy.hpp>`. These headers are not used in the code and can be safely removed.

2. Remove unused macros: The code defines several macros that are not used anywhere in the code, such as `by(x)` and `asche`. These macros can be removed to reduce code complexity.

3. Optimize Fenwick tree implementation:
   - The current implementation of the Fenwick tree uses a 3D array, `multree` and `addtree`, to store the values. This is not memory-efficient since it allocates a large amount of memory even if the grid size is small. Instead, we can optimize the memory usage by using a 2D array and mapping the 2D indices to 1D indices.
   - The current implementation of the Fenwick tree uses bitwise XOR operations to calculate the cumulative values. This can be slow, especially for large values of `mxn`. Instead, we can use a simpler approach of storing the cumulative values directly in the Fenwick tree array.

4. Optimize I/O operations: The code uses `cin` and `cout` for input and output operations. These operations can be slow, especially when performing a large number of operations. Instead, we can use `scanf` and `printf` for faster I/O.

Now, let's discuss each optimization step in detail:

1. Remove unnecessary includes:
   - Remove the following lines from the code:
     ```
     #include <ext/pb_ds/assoc_container.hpp>
     #include <ext/pb_ds/tree_policy.hpp>
     ```
   - These headers are not used in the code and can be safely removed.

2. Remove unused macros:
   - Remove the following macros from the code:
     ```
     #define by(x) [](const auto &a, const auto &b) { return a.x < b.x; }
     #define asche cerr << "Ekhane asche\n";
     ```
   - These macros are not used anywhere in the code and can be safely removed.

3. Optimize Fenwick tree implementation:
   - Modify the `multree` and `addtree` arrays to be 2D arrays of size `mxn x mxn`.
   - Replace the `query2` function with a simplified version that directly calculates the cumulative values in the Fenwick tree array:
     ```cpp
     ll query2(ll tree[mxn][mxn], ll x, ll y) {
       ll sum = 0;
       for (ll i = x; i > 0; i -= i & -i) {
         for (ll j = y; j > 0; j -= j & -j) {
           sum ^= tree[i][j];
         }
       }
       return sum;
     }
     ```
   - Replace the `upd2` function with a simplified version that directly updates the cumulative values in the Fenwick tree array:
     ```cpp
     void upd2(ll tree[mxn][mxn], ll x, ll y, ll val) {
       for (ll i = x; i < mxn; i += i & -i) {
         for (ll j = y; j < mxn; j += j & -j) {
           tree[i][j] ^= val;
         }
       }
     }
     ```

4. Optimize I/O operations:
   - Replace the `cin` and `cout` statements with `scanf` and `printf` for faster I/O:
     ```cpp
     scanf("%lld", &n);
     scanf("%lld", &q);
     while (q--) {
       scanf("%lld", &tt);
       if (tt == 2) {
         scanf("%lld %lld %lld %lld %lld", &x1, &y1, &x2, &y2, &val);
         upd(x1, y1, x2, y2, val);
       } else {
         scanf("%lld %lld %lld %lld", &x1, &y1, &x2, &y2);
         printf("%lld\n", query(x1, y1, x2, y2));
       }
     }
     ```

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#pragma comment(linker, "/stack:200000000")
#pragma GCC optimize("Ofast")
#pragma GCC target("sse,sse2,sse3,ssse3,sse4,popcnt,abm,mmx,avx,tune=native")
#pragma GCC optimize("unroll-loops")
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
#define ll long long
const int mxn = 1010;
ll multree[mxn][mxn], addtree[mxn][mxn];
ll yo(ll x) { return (x % 2); }
ll query2(ll tree[mxn][mxn], ll x, ll y) {
  ll sum = 0;
  for (ll i = x; i > 0; i -= i & -i) {
    for (ll j = y; j > 0; j -= j & -j) {
      sum ^= tree[i][j];
    }
  }
  return sum;
}
ll query1(ll x, ll y) {
  ll mul = 0, add = 0;
  for (ll i = x; i > 0; i -= i & -i) {
    mul ^= query2(multree, i, y);
    add ^= query2(addtree, i, y);
  }
  return (mul * yo(x)) ^ add;
}
ll query(ll x1, ll y1, ll x2, ll y2) {
  return (query1(x2, y2) ^ query1(x1 - 1, y2) ^ query1(x2, y1 - 1) ^
          query1(x1 - 1, y1 - 1));
}
void upd2(ll tree[mxn][mxn], ll x, ll y, ll val) {
  for (ll i = x; i < mxn; i += i & -i) {
    for (ll j = y; j < mxn; j += j & -j) {
      tree[i][j] ^= val;
    }
  }
}
void upd1(ll x, ll y1, ll y2, ll val) {
  upd2(multree, x, y1, val);
  upd2(multree, x, y2, val);
  upd2(addtree, x, y1, val * yo(y1 - 1));
  upd2(addtree, x, y2, val * yo(y2));
}
void upd(ll x1, ll y1, ll x2, ll y2, ll val) {
  upd1(x1, y1, y2, val);
  upd1(x2, y1, y2, val);
}
int main() {
  ll n, q, tt, x1, y1, x2, y2, val;
  scanf("%lld", &n);
  scanf("%lld", &q);
  while (q--) {
    scanf("%lld", &tt);
    if (tt == 2) {
      scanf("%lld %lld %lld %lld %lld", &x1, &y1, &x2, &y2, &val);
      upd(x1, y1, x2, y2, val);
    } else {
      scanf("%lld %lld %lld %lld", &x1, &y1, &x2, &y2);
      printf("%lld\n", query(x1, y1, x2, y2));
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized code makes the following improvements:
- Removes unnecessary includes and unused macros.
- Optimizes the Fenwick tree implementation to use less memory and simpler operations.
- Replaces `cin` and `cout` with `scanf` and `printf` for faster I/O.

These optimizations should result in improved performance and reduced memory usage compared to the original code.
