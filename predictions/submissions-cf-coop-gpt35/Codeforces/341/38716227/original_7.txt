The provided code is a C++ program that performs range updates and range queries on a 2D grid. The program uses a Fenwick tree data structure to efficiently update and query the grid.

Upon analyzing the code, the following potential areas of optimization can be identified:

1. Redundant Data Structures: The code includes many unnecessary data structures such as vectors (vi, vll, vc, vs, vpll, vpii) and unordered maps (umap) and sets (uset) that are not being used. These data structures should be removed to reduce memory usage.

2. Slow Input/Output: The code uses `cin` and `cout` for input and output operations. These operations can be slow, especially when performing a large number of queries. Using faster input/output methods, such as `scanf` and `printf`, can improve performance.

3. Unnecessary Function Calls: The code includes several unnecessary function calls, such as `sqrt`, `log2`, and `one`. These function calls can be computationally expensive and may not be required for the given problem. Removing these function calls can improve performance.

4. Pragma Directives: The code includes several pragma directives that can hint the compiler to optimize certain parts of the code. These directives can help improve performance by enabling compiler optimizations specific to the target architecture.

Based on these observations, the following optimization strategy can be formulated:

1. Remove unnecessary data structures such as vectors and unordered maps/sets.
2. Replace `cin` and `cout` with faster input/output methods (`scanf` and `printf`).
3. Remove unnecessary function calls, such as `sqrt`, `log2`, and `one`.
4. Retain the pragma directives as they can help optimize the code further.

Now, we will proceed with the step-by-step explanation of each optimization and provide the optimized code.
