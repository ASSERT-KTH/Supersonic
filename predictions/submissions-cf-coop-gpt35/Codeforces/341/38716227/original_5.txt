The given code is a C++ program that performs range updates and range queries on a 2D grid. The program uses Fenwick trees to efficiently update and query the grid. 

However, there are several areas in the code that can be optimized for better efficiency:

1. Unnecessary includes: The program includes several unnecessary headers that are not used in the code. This can increase the compile time and potentially affect performance.

2. Redundant macros: The code contains several macros that are not used in the program. These macros can be removed to simplify the code and improve readability.

3. Redundant bitwise operations: The `yo()` function performs a bitwise operation on the input argument, which is not necessary. This can be simplified by returning the input argument modulo 2.

4. Inefficient data structures: The program uses a 3D array to store the Fenwick trees. This can be replaced with a 2D array, reducing memory usage and potentially improving cache locality.

5. Lack of loop unrolling: The loops used to update and query the Fenwick trees can be unrolled to reduce loop overhead and improve performance.

6. Lack of compiler optimizations: The program does not use any compiler optimization flags, such as `-O2` or `-O3`, which can enable various optimization techniques performed by the compiler.

Based on these observations, the following optimization steps can be taken:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: Remove the unnecessary includes that are not used in the code, such as `<ext/pb_ds/assoc_container.hpp>` and `<ext/pb_ds/tree_policy.hpp>`.

2. Remove redundant macros: Remove the macros that are not used in the code, such as `printa`, `printv`, `print2d`, `by`, `asche`, and `_case`.

3. Simplify the `yo()` function: Simplify the `yo()` function by returning the input argument modulo 2 instead of performing a bitwise operation.

4. Replace the 3D array with a 2D array: Replace the `multree` and `addtree` 3D arrays with 2D arrays to reduce memory usage and potentially improve cache locality. Update the corresponding functions `query2()`, `upd2()`, and `upd1()` accordingly.

5. Unroll the loops: Unroll the loops in the `query2()`, `upd2()`, and `upd1()` functions to reduce loop overhead.

6. Enable compiler optimizations: Add compiler optimization flags (`-O2` or `-O3`) to enable various optimization techniques performed by the compiler.

These optimizations should improve the performance and memory usage of the given code. However, please note that the effectiveness of these optimizations may vary depending on the specific characteristics of the input data and the compiler used.
