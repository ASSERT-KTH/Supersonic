Code Analysis:

1. The code defines a structure `SegTree` which represents a segment tree. The segment tree is built using an array `arr` and has a tree structure stored in the `tree` vector. The `store` vector is used to store the positions of each element in the original array.

2. The `merge` function is used to merge two values in the segment tree. It takes two values `lval` and `rval` and compares the number of occurrences of these values in the range `sl` to `sr`. It returns the value that has more occurrences.

3. The `build` function is used to build the segment tree recursively. It takes the start index `ss`, end index `se`, and current index `si`. If `ss` is equal to `se`, it stores the value of `arr[ss]` in the tree. Otherwise, it calculates the mid index `mid` and recursively builds the left and right subtrees, and then merges the values of the left and right subtrees.

4. The `query` function is used to query the segment tree for the maximum occurring value in a given range. It takes the query range `qs` to `qe`, the current range `ss` to `se`, the current index `si`, and the original query range `sl` to `sr`. If the current range is completely within the query range, it returns the value at the current index. Otherwise, it calculates the mid index `mid` and recursively queries the left or right subtree based on the query range.

5. The `solve` function reads the input, builds the segment tree, and performs the queries. For each query, it finds the maximum occurring value in the range `l` to `r`, and calculates the number of occurrences `mx`. It then calculates the length of the range `len` and the number of extra occurrences `extra`. Finally, it calculates the number of elements to the left of the maximum occurring value as `left` and prints the result.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Inefficient data structures:
   - The `store` vector is used to store the positions of each element in the original array. However, it is not necessary to store the positions for each element in a separate vector. Instead, we can use a single vector of vectors to store the positions of all elements. This will reduce memory usage and improve cache locality.

2. Redundant computations:
   - The `merge` function performs two binary searches to find the number of occurrences of `lval` and `rval` in the range `sl` to `sr`. These binary searches can be replaced with a single linear search, as the `store` vector is already sorted for each element.

3. Loop optimization:
   - The loop in the `build` function can be optimized by using a loop variable instead of recursion. This will eliminate the function call overhead and improve performance.

4. Compiler optimizations:
   - The code can benefit from compiler optimizations such as loop unrolling, function inlining, and vectorization. We can use compiler-specific pragmas or flags to enable these optimizations.

Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. Replace the `store` vector with a single vector of vectors to store the positions of all elements. Modify the `SegTree` structure and the `solve` function accordingly.

2. Replace the binary searches in the `merge` function with a single linear search. Modify the `merge` function accordingly.

3. Replace the recursive implementation of the `build` function with a loop-based implementation. Modify the `build` function accordingly.

4. Enable compiler optimizations by adding appropriate pragmas or flags.

The optimized code makes the following changes:

1. Replaces the `store` vector with a single vector of vectors to store the positions of all elements.
2. Replaces the binary searches in the `merge` function with a single linear search.
3. Replaces the recursive implementation of the `build` function with a loop-based implementation.
4. Removes unnecessary typedefs and defines.
5. Adds comments to highlight the changes made.

These changes improve memory usage by reducing the number of vectors used and improve performance by eliminating unnecessary binary searches and recursive calls.
