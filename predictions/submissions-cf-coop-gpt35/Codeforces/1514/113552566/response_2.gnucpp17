The given code is a C++ program that solves a range query problem using a segment tree data structure. The program takes input values for the number of elements in the array `n`, the number of queries `q`, and the array elements. It then performs range queries on the array and outputs the result.

To optimize this code, we can focus on the following areas:

1. Avoid unnecessary memory allocations and copies.
2. Optimize the range query algorithm.
3. Minimize the number of function calls and loops.

Now let's go through each optimization step in detail.

Step 1: Avoid unnecessary memory allocations and copies
-------------------------------------------------------
In the current code, there are unnecessary memory allocations and copies that can be avoided.

1. The `store` vector is used to store the indices of each element in the array. However, it is not required to store the indices for each element separately. Instead, we can use a vector of sets or unordered_sets to store the indices. This way, we can directly query the set to find the number of elements within a range.

2. The `tree` vector is used to store the segment tree. However, the size of the vector is not always equal to `4 * n`. It can be smaller in some cases. We can optimize the memory usage by resizing the vector dynamically based on the input size.

Step 2: Optimize the range query algorithm
------------------------------------------
The range query algorithm can be optimized by reducing the number of function calls and eliminating unnecessary calculations.

1. In the `merge` function, the `upper_bound` and `lower_bound` calls are unnecessary. We can replace them with a loop that iterates over the indices of the two elements and counts the number of elements within the range.

2. In the `query` function, we can eliminate the unnecessary recursion by using an iterative approach. We can use a stack or a queue to store the nodes of the segment tree and process them iteratively.

Step 3: Minimize the number of function calls and loops
------------------------------------------------------
We can further optimize the code by minimizing the number of function calls and loops.

1. In the `solve` function, the loop that reads the array elements can be replaced with a more efficient approach using `std::copy` or `std::istream_iterator`.

2. The loop in the `main` function that calls the `solve` function can be removed since the loop only runs once.
