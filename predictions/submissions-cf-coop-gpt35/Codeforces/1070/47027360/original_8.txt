Code Analysis:
1. The code includes unnecessary header files, such as `<bits/stdc++.h>`, which can slow down compilation time.
2. The code uses macros for input/output operations, which can reduce code readability and maintainability.
3. The code uses a `pii` data structure to store pairs of integers, but it is not clear why this data structure is necessary in this context.
4. The code uses a 2D array `vis` to keep track of visited states, which may consume a large amount of memory for larger values of `s` and `d`.
5. The code uses a 2D array `dp` to store the previous state for each visited state, but it is not clear why this information is necessary in this context.
6. The code uses a `queue` for the breadth-first search (BFS), but it is not clear why a BFS is necessary for this problem.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Remove unnecessary header files: The code includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header, which includes every standard library header file. This can slow down compilation time. Instead, include only the necessary header files, such as `<iostream>`, `<queue>`, and `<algorithm>`.
2. Remove macros for input/output operations: The code uses macros like `sf`, `sf2`, `sl`, etc. to read input values. Macros can make the code difficult to read and understand. Instead, use regular function calls like `scanf` or `cin` for input operations.
3. Remove unnecessary data structures: The code uses a `pii` data structure to store pairs of integers, but it is not clear why this data structure is necessary in this context. Remove the `pii` data structure and replace it with regular integer variables where appropriate.
4. Optimize memory usage: The code uses a 2D array `vis` to keep track of visited states. However, for larger values of `s` and `d`, this can consume a large amount of memory. Instead, use a 1D array of size `d` to store the visited states.
5. Remove unnecessary state tracking: The code uses a 2D array `dp` to store the previous state for each visited state. However, it is not clear why this information is necessary in this context. Remove the `dp` array and any related code.
6. Optimize the search algorithm: The code uses a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to find a solution. However, it is not clear why a BFS is necessary for this problem. Analyze the problem requirements and constraints to determine if there is a more efficient algorithm that can be used.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Remove unnecessary header files: Replace the `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` line with the necessary header files, such as `#include <iostream>`, `#include <queue>`, and `#include <algorithm>`.
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>
#include <algorithm>
```
2. Remove macros for input/output operations: Replace the macros for input/output operations with regular function calls.
```cpp
// Replace macros like sf, sf2, sl, etc. with regular function calls
int d, s;
std::cin >> d >> s;
```
3. Remove unnecessary data structures: Replace the `pii` data structure with regular integer variables where appropriate.
```cpp
// Replace pii with regular integer variables
int dp[6000][600];
```
4. Optimize memory usage: Replace the 2D array `vis` with a 1D array of size `d` to store the visited states.
```cpp
// Replace vis 2D array with 1D array
int vis[600];
```
5. Remove unnecessary state tracking: Remove the `dp` array and any related code.
```cpp
// Remove dp array and related code
```
6. Optimize the search algorithm: Analyze the problem requirements and constraints to determine if there is a more efficient algorithm that can be used.
