Code Analysis:
1. The code includes a number of unnecessary header files that are not used in the program.
2. There are multiple macros defined that are not used in the code.
3. The code uses a lot of unnecessary global variables, such as `INF`, `fx`, `fy`, `dir`, etc.
4. The `bfs` function uses a 2D array `vis` to keep track of visited nodes. However, this array is unnecessarily large and can be optimized.
5. The `dp` array is a 2D array that is used to store the previous state of each node. However, it is not necessary to store the state of each node in this array. Only the previous state of the final node (`(0, 0)`) needs to be stored.
6. The `print` function uses recursion to print the path from the final state to the initial state. This can be optimized to avoid unnecessary function calls.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Remove unnecessary header files, macros, and global variables.
2. Optimize the `vis` array by using a 1D array instead of a 2D array.
3. Optimize the `dp` array by using a single pair variable instead of a 2D array.
4. Optimize the `print` function to avoid recursion and unnecessary function calls.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Remove unnecessary header files: The `bits/stdc++.h` header file includes multiple standard C++ header files. However, only a few of them are used in the code. Remove the `bits/stdc++.h` header and include only the necessary headers (`iostream`, `queue`, `vector`, and `algorithm`).

2. Remove unnecessary macros: The macros defined in the code are not used and can be removed.

3. Remove unnecessary global variables: The global variables `INF`, `fx`, `fy`, `dir`, etc. are not used and can be removed.

4. Optimize the `vis` array: The `vis` array is used to keep track of visited nodes in the BFS algorithm. However, the array is unnecessarily large. The maximum value for `vis` is `6000 * 600`, but only `d` and `s` values up to `600` are used in the code. Therefore, the `vis` array can be optimized by using a 1D array of size `d`.

5. Optimize the `dp` array: The `dp` array is a 2D array used to store the previous state of each node. However, it is not necessary to store the state of each node in this array. Only the previous state of the final node (`(0, 0)`) needs to be stored. Therefore, the `dp` array can be optimized by using a single pair variable instead of a 2D array.

6. Optimize the `print` function: The `print` function uses recursion to print the path from the final state to the initial state. However, this can be optimized to avoid unnecessary function calls. Instead of using recursion, a loop can be used to print the path in reverse order.

Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

int s, d;
int vis[600];
pair<int, int> dp;

int bfs() {
  queue<pair<int, int>> q;
  q.push(make_pair(s, 0));
  vis[s] = 1;
  pair<int, int> p;
  int f = 1, mul, sum;
  while (!q.empty()) {
    p = q.front();
    q.pop();
    for (int i = f; i < 10; i++) {
      sum = p.first;
      sum -= i;
      mul = p.second;
      mul *= 10;
      mul += i;
      mul %= d;
      if (sum == 0 && mul == 0) {
        dp = make_pair(p.first, p.second);
        return 1;
      }
      if (sum >= 0 && !vis[sum]) {
        vis[sum] = 1;
        q.push(make_pair(sum, mul));
        dp = make_pair(p.first, p.second);
      }
    }
    f = 0;
  }
  return 0;
}

void print() {
  int sum = 0, mul = 0;
  while (sum != s || mul != 0) {
    int prev_sum = dp.first;
    int prev_mul = dp.second;
    cout << prev_sum - sum;
    sum = prev_sum;
    mul = prev_mul;
  }
}

int main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(0);
  cout.tie(0);
  
  cin >> d >> s;
  
  if (bfs() == 1) {
    print();
  } else {
    cout << -1 << endl;
  }
  
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized code simplifies the code by removing unnecessary header files, macros, and global variables. It also optimizes the data structures by using a 1D array instead of a 2D array for the `vis` array and a single pair variable instead of a 2D array for the `dp` array. The `print` function is optimized to avoid recursion and unnecessary function calls. Overall, these changes improve the efficiency of the code and minimize memory usage.
