The code provided is a C++ program that takes in an integer `t` as input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it takes in two integers `n` and `k`, followed by an array of size `n` containing integers. The program then assigns colors to elements of the array based on certain conditions and outputs the resulting array.

Upon analyzing the code, here are some potential areas for optimization:

1. `unordered_map<int, vector<int>> m1` is used to store the indices of each element in the input array. However, using an `unordered_map` incurs additional memory overhead and hash calculations. Since the input array is of size `2e5`, this can be a significant performance bottleneck.

2. The algorithm assigns colors to elements based on their frequencies. If the frequency is greater than or equal to `k`, it assigns colors in a specific pattern. Otherwise, it assigns colors sequentially until a certain count is reached. This process involves multiple nested loops, which can be optimized.

3. The use of `goto` statements can make the control flow harder to understand and maintain.
