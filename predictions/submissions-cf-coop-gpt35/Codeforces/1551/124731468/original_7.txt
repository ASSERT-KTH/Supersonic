The given code is a C++ program that takes an input integer `t` and performs a series of operations `t` times. In each iteration, the program takes two integers `n` and `k` as input, followed by `n` integers representing an array. The program then assigns colors to elements of the array based on specific conditions and prints the resulting color assignments.

Upon analyzing the code, we can identify several potential areas for optimization:

1. Inefficient Memory Usage:
   - The arrays `arr` and `ans` have a fixed size of `maxn`, which is `2e5 + 50`. However, in each iteration, the program only uses `n` elements of these arrays. This leads to inefficient memory usage, especially when `n` is much smaller than `maxn`.

2. Unnecessary Computations:
   - The program uses `memset` to set all elements of `arr` and `ans` to zero in each iteration. However, this is unnecessary because these arrays are immediately populated with new values in the subsequent code.

3. Inefficient Data Structure:
   - The program uses an `unordered_map` to store the indices of elements with the same value in the array. However, iterating over an `unordered_map` can be slow compared to other data structures like arrays or vectors.

4. Redundant Loop:
   - The program uses a nested loop to iterate over the elements in the `m1` map. However, this can be optimized to eliminate unnecessary iterations.

5. Unnecessary Conditional Check:
   - The program checks if `ans[x]` is equal to zero before assigning a new color. However, since `ans` is initialized to zero at the beginning of each iteration, this check is redundant.

6. Early Termination:
   - The program uses a `goto` statement to prematurely exit the loop when `cnt <= 0`. This can be replaced with a more structured approach for better code readability.

Based on these observations, we can propose the following optimization steps:

1. Replace the fixed-size arrays `arr` and `ans` with dynamically allocated arrays of size `n`.
2. Remove the `memset` calls for `arr` and `ans`.
3. Replace the `unordered_map` with a more efficient data structure, such as a vector of vectors.
4. Optimize the loop over the elements in `m1` to eliminate unnecessary iterations.
5. Remove the conditional check for `ans[x]` before assigning a new color.
6. Replace the `goto` statement with a more structured approach for early termination.

Now, let's implement these optimization steps in the code:
