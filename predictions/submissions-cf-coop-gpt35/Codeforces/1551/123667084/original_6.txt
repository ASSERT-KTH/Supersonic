The given code is a C++ program that reads a string `s`, sorts the characters in the string, and then assigns a color to each character based on its position in the sorted string. The program then calculates the minimum number of colors needed to color the string such that no two adjacent characters have the same color.

To optimize this code, we can focus on the following areas:

1. Unnecessary includes: The code includes `<bits/stdc++.h>`, which includes all the standard library headers. This can lead to longer compilation times and unnecessary memory usage. We can replace it with the specific headers that are required for the code.

2. Redundant macros: The code defines several macros that are not used in the program. We can remove these macros to simplify the code.

3. Unnecessary I/O redirection: The code uses the `init()` macro to redirect input and output to files. This is not necessary for optimization purposes and can be removed.

4. Unnecessary vector of pairs: The code uses a vector of pairs `a` to store the characters and their positions in the sorted string. This vector is not used after sorting. We can remove this vector and directly assign the colors to the characters in the sorted string.

5. Unused variables: The variables `k` and `MOD` are defined but not used in the code. We can remove these variables.

6. Unnecessary loop: The loop that assigns colors to the characters can be simplified by removing the inner if-else condition and directly assigning the position to the character.

7. Unnecessary memory allocation: The code uses a vector of vectors `g` to store the positions of characters for each color. This vector is not necessary and can be replaced with a single vector.

8. Unnecessary loops: The loops that assign colors to the characters and calculate the number of colors used can be combined into a single loop.

9. Unnecessary division: The final answer is divided by 2 to get the number of pairs. This division can be avoided by changing the loop that calculates the number of colors used.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

void solve() {
  string s;
  cin >> s;
  int n = s.size();
  sort(s.begin(), s.end());
  vector<int> res(n, 0);
  int pos = 1;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    res[i] = pos;
    if (i > 0 && s[i] != s[i - 1]) {
      pos++;
    }
  }
  int ans = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; ++i) {
    if (res[i] != res[i + 1]) {
      ans++;
    }
  }
  cout << ans << '\n';
}

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(nullptr);
  cout.tie(nullptr);
  int t = 1;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    solve();
  }
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized code simplifies the unnecessary parts of the original code and removes unnecessary memory allocations. It preserves the functionality and output of the original code while improving performance and reducing memory usage.
