The given code appears to be a program that solves a specific problem. However, there are several areas where performance optimization can be implemented. Let's analyze the code to identify potential bottlenecks and inefficient memory usage.

1. The code includes unnecessary header files. The `bits/stdc++.h` header file includes almost all standard library headers, which can result in increased compilation time and unnecessary memory usage. We should only include the necessary headers for this specific program.

2. The `init()` function is defined but not used in the code. It can be removed to avoid confusion.

3. The `db_problem()` function is defined but not used in the code. It can be removed to avoid confusion.

4. The `fastio()` function is called, but it is not clear if it provides any performance benefits in this specific program. We should analyze its impact and decide whether to keep it or remove it.

5. The `vt` alias for `vector` is unnecessary and can be removed.

6. The `us` alias for `unsigned` is unnecessary and can be removed.

7. The `pb` alias for `push_back` is unnecessary and can be removed.

8. The `fi` and `se` aliases for `first` and `second` in the `pair` template are unnecessary and can be removed.

9. The `pii` alias for `pair<int, int>` is unnecessary and can be removed.

10. The `db` alias for `double` is unnecessary and can be removed.

11. The `operator<<` function for `vector` is defined but not used in the code. It can be removed to avoid confusion.

12. The `operator>>` function for `vector` is defined but not used in the code. It can be removed to avoid confusion.

13. The `operator<<` function for `pair` is defined but not used in the code. It can be removed to avoid confusion.

14. The `operator>>` function for `pair` is defined but not used in the code. It can be removed to avoid confusion.

15. The `solve()` function contains the main logic of the program. We should analyze its complexity and identify any potential optimizations.

16. The `g` vector of vectors is used to store indices of elements based on a specific condition. It can be optimized to reduce memory usage.

17. The `res` vector is used to store the final result. It can be optimized to reduce memory usage.

18. The `ans` variable is used to store the final answer. It can be optimized to reduce memory usage.

Now that we have analyzed the code and identified potential areas for optimization, let's formulate an optimization strategy and provide a step-by-step explanation for each optimization step.
