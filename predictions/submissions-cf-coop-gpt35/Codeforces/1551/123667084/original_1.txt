The given code appears to be a solution to a problem, where the goal is to count the number of pairs of characters in a string that are not adjacent to each other. The code reads an input string, sorts it, and then partitions it into groups of consecutive characters. The final count is then computed based on these groups.

To optimize this code, we can focus on the following areas:

1. Unnecessary includes: The code includes the entire `bits/stdc++.h` header file, which is not efficient. We should only include the necessary header files.

2. Redundant macros: The code defines several macros that are not used. We should remove these unnecessary macros.

3. Inefficient string sorting: The code sorts the string using the `sort` function. However, this is not the most efficient approach. We can improve the performance by using counting sort instead.

4. Inefficient group partitioning: The code partitions the sorted string into groups using an `if-else` statement inside a loop. This can be optimized by using a more efficient algorithm.

5. Unnecessary vector of vectors: The code uses a vector of vectors to store the groups. This can be simplified by using a single vector.

6. Redundant count calculation: The code iterates over the result vector to count the number of non-zero elements. This can be optimized by keeping a running count.

7. Unnecessary precision setting: The code sets the precision of the output stream with `cout.precision(10)`. This is not required for the given problem.

Now let's proceed with the optimization steps one by one.
