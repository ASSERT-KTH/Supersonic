Code Analysis:
- The code includes unnecessary header files. We can remove `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` and include only the necessary header files.
- Macros like `rep`, `for1`, `FOR`, `FORD`, `nx`, `pp`, `ppi`, and `pri` are used instead of standard C++ constructs. These macros make the code less readable and can be replaced with the corresponding C++ constructs.
- The code uses an array to store the input values, which can be replaced with a vector to avoid potential buffer overflow.
- The code uses a loop to find the minimum element in each array, which can be replaced with the `min_element` function to improve readability and potentially performance.
- The code performs multiple redundant calculations inside the loop, which can be optimized to reduce the number of operations and improve efficiency.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Remove unnecessary header files.
2. Replace macros with corresponding C++ constructs.
3. Replace arrays with vectors.
4. Replace loop-based minimum element finding with the `min_element` function.
5. Optimize the calculation inside the loop to reduce redundant operations.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Remove unnecessary header files:
   - The `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` header file includes many other header files, which can lead to increased compilation time and unnecessary dependencies. Instead, include only the necessary header files.
   - Remove the line `#pragma GCC optimize("O2")` as it is not necessary and might limit the ability to apply further optimizations.

2. Replace macros with corresponding C++ constructs:
   - Replace `rep(i, n)` with a standard for loop: `for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)`.
   - Replace `for1(i, n)` with `for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++)`.
   - Replace `FOR(i, a, b)` with `for (int i = a; i <= b; i++)`.
   - Replace `FORD(i, a, b)` with `for (int i = a; i >= b; i--)`.
   - Replace `nx` with `cout << "\n";`.

3. Replace arrays with vectors:
   - Replace `ll a[n], b[n];` with `vector<ll> a(n), b(n);`.

4. Replace loop-based minimum element finding with `min_element` function:
   - Replace `ll ma = *min_element(a, a + n), mo = *min_element(b, b + n);` with `ll ma = *min_element(a.begin(), a.end()), mo = *min_element(b.begin(), b.end());`.

5. Optimize calculation inside the loop:
   - Initialize `ans` to 0 before the loop.
   - Instead of performing multiple conditional checks inside the loop, we can calculate the values to be added to `ans` in a single step.
   - Calculate `x` as the minimum of `(a[i] - ma)` and `(b[i] - mo)`.
   - Subtract `x` from both `a[i]` and `b[i]`.
   - Add `x` to `ans`.
   - Add the remaining difference between `a[i]` and `ma` to `ans` if `a[i] > ma`, otherwise add the difference between `b[i]` and `mo` to `ans`.

Optimized Code Block:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

typedef long long int ll;

int main() {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(0);
    cout.tie(0);

    int tc;
    cin >> tc;
    while (tc--) {
        int n;
        cin >> n;
        vector<ll> a(n), b(n);
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            cin >> a[i];
        }
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            cin >> b[i];
        }

        ll ma = *min_element(a.begin(), a.end());
        ll mo = *min_element(b.begin(), b.end());

        ll ans = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            ll x = min(a[i] - ma, b[i] - mo);
            a[i] -= x;
            b[i] -= x;
            ans += x;

            if (a[i] > ma) {
                ans += a[i] - ma;
            } else {
                ans += b[i] - mo;
            }
        }

        cout << ans << "\n";
    }

    return 0;
}
```

The optimized code retains the functionality and output of the original code while improving performance by removing unnecessary dependencies, replacing macros with standard C++ constructs, using vectors instead of arrays, and optimizing the calculation inside the loop.
