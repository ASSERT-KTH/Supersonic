Code Analysis:
Upon analyzing the given code, the following potential performance bottlenecks and areas for optimization can be identified:

1. Unnecessary includes: The code includes the entire "bits/stdc++.h" header, which is not recommended as it includes a large number of unnecessary headers. This can increase the compile time and memory usage.

2. Redundant macros: The code defines multiple macros for looping, which can be replaced with standard C++ loop constructs. Using standard loops can improve code readability and potentially optimize the loops.

3. Unoptimized power function: The code uses a simple power function using repeated multiplication. This can be slow for large exponents and can be optimized using exponentiation by squaring.

4. Inefficient array access: The code accesses elements of arrays "a" and "b" multiple times using the "min_element" function. This can be optimized by storing the minimum values in variables and reusing them.

5. Inefficient if-else conditions: The code uses multiple if-else conditions to calculate the answer. These conditions can be simplified and optimized to avoid redundant computations.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: Replace the "#include <bits/stdc++.h>" with the necessary standard library headers that are actually used in the code. This will reduce the compile time and memory usage.

2. Replace macros with standard loops: Replace the macros "rep", "for1", "FOR", and "FORD" with standard C++ loop constructs. This will improve code readability and potentially optimize the loops.

3. Optimize power function: Replace the "binpow" function with a more efficient exponentiation by squaring algorithm. This will significantly improve the performance of the power calculation.

4. Optimize array access: Store the minimum values of arrays "a" and "b" in variables instead of calling the "min_element" function multiple times. This will reduce the number of array accesses and improve performance.

5. Simplify and optimize if-else conditions: Simplify and optimize the if-else conditions in the main loop to avoid redundant computations and improve efficiency.

Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: Remove the line "#include <bits/stdc++.h>" and include the necessary standard library headers that are actually used in the code. For example, if the code uses "iostream" and "algorithm" headers, include them explicitly.

2. Replace macros with standard loops: Replace the macros "rep", "for1", "FOR", and "FORD" with standard C++ loop constructs. For example, replace "rep(i, n)" with "for(int i = 0; i < n; i++)".

3. Optimize power function: Replace the "binpow" function with a more efficient exponentiation by squaring algorithm. This can be implemented as follows:
```
long long binpow(long long a, long long b) {
  long long res = 1;
  while (b > 0) {
    if (b & 1)
      res *= a;
    a *= a;
    b >>= 1;
  }
  return res;
}
```

4. Optimize array access: Store the minimum values of arrays "a" and "b" in variables instead of calling the "min_element" function multiple times. This can be done as follows:
```
ll ma = a[0], mo = b[0];
for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
  ma = min(ma, a[i]);
  mo = min(mo, b[i]);
}
```

5. Simplify and optimize if-else conditions: Simplify the if-else conditions in the main loop to avoid redundant computations and improve efficiency. The optimized code can be as follows:
```
ll ans = 0;
for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
  if (a[i] > ma && b[i] > mo) {
    ll x = min(a[i] - ma, b[i] - mo);
    a[i] -= x;
    b[i] -= x;
    ans += x;
  }
  if (a[i] > ma) {
    ans += a[i] - ma;
  } else if (b[i] > mo) {
    ans += b[i] - mo;
  }
}
```
