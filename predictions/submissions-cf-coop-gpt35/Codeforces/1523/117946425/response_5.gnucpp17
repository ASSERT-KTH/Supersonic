The given code appears to solve a problem involving bitwise operations and dynamic programming. The main optimization opportunities in this code include:

1. Reducing memory usage: The code currently uses a vector of long long integers (`vector<ll> a(n + 1)`) to store input values. However, for each element in `a`, only a few bits are used to represent the values. Therefore, we can optimize memory usage by storing the values using a more memory-efficient data structure.

2. Reducing redundant computations: The code computes the same values multiple times. For example, the code computes `__builtin_popcount(k)` for each value of `k` in the innermost loop. This can be optimized by storing the results in an array and reusing them.

3. Reducing unnecessary calculations: The code uses a nested loop (`rep(j, 0, m - 1)` inside `rep(i, 1, min(200, n))`) to iterate through all possible combinations of bits. However, since we are only interested in the combinations that satisfy a specific condition, we can optimize the loop to avoid unnecessary calculations.

4. Compiler optimizations: We can suggest compiler optimizations or pragma directives to hint the compiler to optimize certain parts of the code. This can include loop unrolling, vectorization, or compiler-specific optimization flags.
