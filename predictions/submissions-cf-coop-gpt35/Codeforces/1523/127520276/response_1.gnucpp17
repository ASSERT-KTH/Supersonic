## Code Analysis
- The code is implementing a rental scheduling algorithm where the goal is to find the minimum number of days required to rent a specific interval given a set of rental intervals.
- The code uses a custom data structure `CT` to store the rental intervals in a binary tree-like structure, allowing efficient querying for the minimum end time of intervals that start after a given time.
- The code uses a Fenwick tree (`ft`) to store the `CT` data structure for each possible interval length. The Fenwick tree is updated whenever a rental interval is added.
- The code then iterates over each possible rental interval length and performs a query on the Fenwick tree to find the minimum end time of intervals that start within the current interval length.
- The minimum end time is used to split the current interval into two smaller intervals, which are then added to the queue for further processing.
- Finally, the code outputs the minimum number of days required to rent an interval of each possible length.

## Optimization Strategy
1. Use a more efficient data structure to store the rental intervals instead of the custom `CT` structure.
2. Replace the Fenwick tree with a more efficient data structure to store the rental intervals for each interval length.
3. Optimize the querying process to reduce the number of operations and memory accesses.
4. Optimize the loop iterations to minimize unnecessary computations.
5. Utilize compiler optimizations to improve performance.

## Step-by-Step Explanation
1. Optimization: Replace the `CT` data structure with a more efficient alternative.
- The `CT` data structure is a binary tree-like structure that stores rental intervals. However, the implementation uses a custom data structure and complex operations for insertion and splitting.
- Instead of using a custom data structure, we can use a `std::set` or `std::map` to store the rental intervals. These data structures provide efficient insertion and querying operations.
- Additionally, we can use `std::lower_bound` to find the minimum end time of intervals that start after a given time, instead of traversing the binary tree-like structure.

2. Optimization: Replace the Fenwick tree with a more efficient alternative.
- The Fenwick tree (`ft`) is used to store the `CT` data structure for each possible interval length. However, the Fenwick tree requires additional memory and operations for updating and querying.
- Instead of using a Fenwick tree, we can use a `std::vector<std::set>` to store the rental intervals for each interval length. This eliminates the need for a separate data structure and reduces memory usage.
- The `std::vector<std::set>` can be pre-allocated with the maximum possible interval length, and each element in the vector corresponds to a specific interval length.

3. Optimization: Optimize the querying process.
- The current querying process uses a loop with bitwise operations to iterate over the Fenwick tree and perform a query on each element.
- Instead of using a loop, we can use `std::upper_bound` and `std::lower_bound` to find the intervals that overlap with the specified range.
- By using `std::upper_bound`, we can find the first interval that ends after the specified range, and by using `std::lower_bound`, we can find the first interval that starts after the specified range.
- The difference between the two iterators gives the number of intervals that overlap with the specified range.

4. Optimization: Optimize loop iterations.
- The current code uses a loop to iterate over each possible rental interval length (`for (int rented = 1; rented <= n; ++rented)`).
- However, the loop can be optimized by starting from the largest interval length and iterating in reverse order.
- This optimization reduces the number of iterations and eliminates unnecessary computations for smaller interval lengths.

5. Compiler Optimization: Enable compiler optimizations.
- Use compiler optimizations (`-O2`, `-O3`) to allow the compiler to perform various optimizations, such as loop unrolling, function inlining, and instruction scheduling.
