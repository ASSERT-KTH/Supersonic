The given code is an implementation of a rental system that calculates the number of rented intervals for different lengths of time. The program uses a balanced binary search tree (BST) to efficiently store and query the intervals. However, there are several areas where the code can be optimized for better performance and memory usage.

1. The `CT` class represents a balanced BST. However, the current implementation stores the BST nodes as a vector, which can result in inefficient memory usage. Instead, we can use a dynamic memory allocation approach, where each node is individually allocated on the heap. This will reduce memory consumption and improve cache efficiency.

2. The `CT` class performs unnecessary comparisons in the `add` and `split` functions. For example, the condition `if (get(t).x == get(el).x)` in the `add` function is redundant because the same condition is already checked in the previous condition `else if (get(t).x > get(el).x)`. We can remove such redundant conditions to improve the code's efficiency.

3. The `add` function in the `CT` class uses recursion to insert a new node into the BST. However, recursive calls can have a performance impact, especially for large input sizes. We can optimize the `add` function by converting it to an iterative implementation using a loop.

4. The `filterjoin` function in the `CT` class also uses recursion to filter out nodes with a higher value than the given threshold. Similar to the `add` function, we can convert this recursive function to an iterative implementation using a loop.

5. The `query` function in the main program uses a loop to iterate over the BST nodes. However, this loop can be optimized using bitwise operations to improve efficiency.

6. The `ans` array in the main program is unnecessarily large and can be reduced in size to match the actual number of rented intervals.

7. There are several unnecessary includes in the code, such as `<algorithm>` and `<utility>`. We should remove these includes to reduce compilation time.
