The provided code is a C++ program that solves a rental problem. The program takes as input the number of rental units and the number of rental queries. For each rental query, it takes the start and end dates of the rental. The program then calculates the number of rented units for each possible rental duration and outputs the results.

Upon analyzing the code, there are several areas that can be optimized to improve the program's efficiency:

1. Memory Usage:
   - The `by_length` vector is used to store rental queries based on their length. However, it is not necessary to store all rental queries for each length. Instead, we can store only the indices of the rental queries. This will reduce memory usage and improve cache efficiency.
   - The `ft` array is an array of `CT` objects. Each `CT` object stores a vector of `CTVertex` objects. We can optimize this by using a single vector to store all `CTVertex` objects, eliminating the need for multiple `CT` objects and reducing memory overhead.

2. Redundant Computations:
   - The `query` function is called multiple times within the nested loops of the main algorithm. Since the `query` function performs the same computation for the same inputs, it is possible to cache the results and avoid redundant computations.

3. Compiler Optimizations:
   - Compiler optimizations, such as loop unrolling or vectorization, can be used to improve the performance of certain loops or computations.

Now, let's optimize the code step by step.
