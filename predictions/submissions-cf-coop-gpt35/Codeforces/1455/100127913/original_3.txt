Upon analyzing the given code, I have identified a few potential areas for optimization:

1. Unnecessary includes: The code includes unnecessary headers such as `<bits/stdc++.h>` and `<iostream>`. We can remove these includes to improve compile time.

2. Redundant macros: The code defines several macros, such as `ll`, `ull`, `ui`, `vi`, `vll`, `pb`, `ld`, `mp`, `pii`, `mod`, `rep`, `repp`, `all`, `input`, and `ordered_set`, which are not used in the code. We can remove these macros to simplify the code.

3. Inefficient loop: The code uses a loop to calculate the number of moves required to reach `x`. However, this can be optimized by using a mathematical formula to calculate the number of moves in constant time.

4. Redundant conditional check: The code checks if the number of moves is equal to `x + 1` and increments it by 1. However, this condition is always false because the loop breaks when `moves * (moves + 1) / 2` is greater than or equal to `x`. We can remove this redundant check.

5. Redundant `using` statement: The code includes a `using` statement for the `__gnu_pbds` namespace, but it is not used in the code. We can remove this statement.

Based on these observations, the following optimization steps can be taken:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: Remove the includes for `<bits/stdc++.h>` and `<iostream>`.

2. Remove redundant macros: Remove the unused macros such as `ll`, `ull`, `ui`, `vi`, `vll`, `pb`, `ld`, `mp`, `pii`, `mod`, `rep`, `repp`, `all`, `input`, and `ordered_set`.

3. Optimize the loop: Replace the loop with a single line of code to calculate the number of moves using the formula `moves = ceil((-1 + sqrt(1 + 8 * x)) / 2)`. This formula calculates the number of moves required to reach `x` in constant time.

4. Remove redundant conditional check: Remove the conditional check for `moves * (moves + 1) / 2 == x + 1` and the corresponding increment of `moves`.

5. Remove unused `using` statement: Remove the `using` statement for the `__gnu_pbds` namespace.

Let's proceed with the optimized code:
