Analysis:
- The code imports a number of libraries and defines several macros, but they don't seem to affect the performance directly.
- The main loop calculates the minimum number of moves required to reach a given number. It uses a brute force approach by incrementing the number of moves until the sum of the arithmetic series is greater than or equal to the target number.
- The calculation of the sum of the arithmetic series is not efficient. It can be simplified to a constant time calculation.
- The overall time complexity of the algorithm is O(sqrt(x)), which can be improved.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Remove unnecessary imports and macros.
2. Replace the brute force calculation of the sum of the arithmetic series with a constant time calculation.
3. Improve the overall time complexity of the algorithm.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Remove unnecessary imports and macros:
   - The code imports several unnecessary libraries and defines macros that are not used in the code. Remove the unnecessary imports and macros to simplify the code.

2. Replace the brute force calculation of the sum of the arithmetic series:
   - The current code calculates the sum of the arithmetic series using the formula (moves * (moves + 1)) / 2. This requires iterating over all the moves until the sum is greater than or equal to the target number.
   - Instead of using a brute force approach, we can use a constant time calculation to find the minimum number of moves required to reach the target number.
   - Let's denote the minimum number of moves as "moves" and the target number as "x".
   - The sum of the arithmetic series from 1 to "moves" is given by the formula (moves * (moves + 1)) / 2.
   - We know that the sum of the arithmetic series is equal to "x", so we can rewrite the equation as (moves * (moves + 1)) / 2 = "x".
   - Multiplying both sides by 2, we get moves * (moves + 1) = 2 * "x".
   - Rearranging the equation, we have moves^2 + moves - 2 * "x" = 0.
   - This is a quadratic equation, which can be solved using the quadratic formula: moves = (-1 + sqrt(1 + 8 * "x")) / 2.
   - Since we are interested in the minimum number of moves, we can round up the result to the nearest integer using the ceil() function.

3. Improve the overall time complexity of the algorithm:
   - The current algorithm has a time complexity of O(sqrt(x)) because it iterates over all the moves until the sum of the arithmetic series is greater than or equal to the target number.
   - We can improve the time complexity by calculating the minimum number of moves directly using the constant time calculation described in the previous step.
   - The new time complexity of the algorithm will be O(1).

Optimized Code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  cout.tie(NULL);
  
  int t = 1;
  cin >> t;
  
  while (t--) {
    long long x;
    cin >> x;
    
    long long moves = ceil((-1 + sqrt(1 + 8 * x)) / 2);
    
    cout << moves << endl;
  }
}
```

The optimized code removes unnecessary imports and macros, replaces the brute force calculation of the sum of the arithmetic series with a constant time calculation, and improves the overall time complexity of the algorithm. The functionality and output of the original code are preserved.
