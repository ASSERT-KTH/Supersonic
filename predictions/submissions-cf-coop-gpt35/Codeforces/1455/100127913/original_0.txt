Code Analysis:
- The code includes several unnecessary header files.
- The code defines a large number of macros, which can lead to reduced code readability and maintainability.
- The code includes unnecessary imports from the `std` namespace using the `using` directive.
- The code uses unnecessary type aliases, such as `ll`, `ull`, `ui`, etc.
- The code uses unnecessary macros, such as `pb`, `mod`, etc.
- The code uses the `rep` and `repp` macros to iterate over a range, which can be replaced with a simple `for` loop.
- The code reads the number of test cases `t` and then reads `t` values for `x`, but the value of `t` is not used in the loop condition.
- The code uses a loop to calculate the number of moves required to reach a certain sum, but this can be done more efficiently using a mathematical formula.
- The code checks if `moves * (moves + 1) / 2 == x + 1` and increments `moves` if true, but this condition can be simplified to `moves * (moves + 1) / 2 <= x`.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Remove unnecessary header files.
2. Remove unnecessary macros and type aliases.
3. Remove unnecessary imports from the `std` namespace.
4. Replace the `rep` and `repp` macros with a simple `for` loop.
5. Rewrite the loop that calculates the number of moves using a mathematical formula.
6. Simplify the condition for incrementing `moves`.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Remove unnecessary header files:
   - The code includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header file, which includes a large number of standard library headers. This can lead to increased compilation time and unnecessary code bloat. Since the code only uses a few standard headers, we can remove `<bits/stdc++.h>` and include only the necessary headers.

2. Remove unnecessary macros and type aliases:
   - The code defines macros such as `ll`, `ull`, `ui`, etc., which are not used in the code. We can remove these macros to improve code readability.
   - Similarly, the code defines macros such as `pb`, `mod`, etc., which can be replaced with their actual values.

3. Remove unnecessary imports from the `std` namespace:
   - The code uses the `using namespace std` directive, which imports all names from the `std` namespace into the global namespace. This can lead to naming conflicts and reduce code readability. We can remove this directive and qualify the standard library names with the `std::` namespace prefix.

4. Replace the `rep` and `repp` macros with a simple `for` loop:
   - The `rep` and `repp` macros are used to iterate over a range. However, these macros can be replaced with a simple `for` loop, which is more readable and does not rely on macros.

5. Rewrite the loop that calculates the number of moves using a mathematical formula:
   - The code uses a loop to calculate the number of moves required to reach a certain sum. However, this can be done more efficiently using a mathematical formula. The sum of the first `n` natural numbers can be calculated using the formula `n * (n + 1) / 2`. We can use this formula to calculate the number of moves without the need for a loop.

6. Simplify the condition for incrementing `moves`:
   - The code checks if `moves * (moves + 1) / 2 == x + 1` and increments `moves` if true. However, this condition can be simplified to `moves * (moves + 1) / 2 <= x`, as we only need to check if the sum is less than or equal to `x`.

Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  std::cin.tie(NULL);
  std::cout.tie(NULL);

  int t;
  std::cin >> t;

  while (t--) {
    long long x;
    std::cin >> x;

    long long moves = (std::sqrt(1 + 8 * x) - 1) / 2;
    if (moves * (moves + 1) / 2 <= x)
      moves++;

    std::cout << moves << std::endl;
  }

  return 0;
}
```

This optimized code removes unnecessary headers, macros, and imports to improve code readability and maintainability. It replaces the loop that calculates the number of moves with a mathematical formula for improved efficiency. The simplified condition for incrementing `moves` also improves code clarity.
