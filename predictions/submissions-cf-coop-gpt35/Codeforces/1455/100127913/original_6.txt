Analysis:
- The code uses several unnecessary includes, such as `<bits/stdc++.h>` and `<iostream>`.
- The code includes some unnecessary macro definitions, such as `ll`, `ull`, `ui`, `vi`, `vll`, `pb`, `ld`, `mp`, `pii`, and `mod`.
- The code includes unnecessary compiler pragmas, such as `#pragma GCC optimize "trapv"`.
- The code uses the `using namespace std;` directive, which is generally considered bad practice.
- The code uses an unnecessary `fio` macro to improve input/output performance.
- The code unnecessarily reads the number of test cases `t` twice.
- The code uses a while loop to calculate the number of moves, which is inefficient.
- The code uses unnecessary arithmetic operations to calculate the triangular number.
- The code unnecessarily checks for a specific condition after the loop.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Remove unnecessary includes, such as `<bits/stdc++.h>` and `<iostream>`.
2. Remove unnecessary macro definitions, such as `ll`, `ull`, `ui`, `vi`, `vll`, `pb`, `ld`, `mp`, `pii`, and `mod`.
3. Remove unnecessary compiler pragmas, such as `#pragma GCC optimize "trapv"`.
4. Avoid using the `using namespace std;` directive.
5. Remove the `fio` macro and its usage.
6. Read the number of test cases only once.
7. Replace the while loop with a more efficient calculation of the number of moves.
8. Use a single conditional statement to check for the specific condition.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Remove unnecessary includes, such as `<bits/stdc++.h>` and `<iostream>`. These includes are not needed and can be safely removed.
2. Remove unnecessary macro definitions, such as `ll`, `ull`, `ui`, `vi`, `vll`, `pb`, `ld`, `mp`, `pii`, and `mod`. These macros are not used in the code and can be safely removed.
3. Remove unnecessary compiler pragmas, such as `#pragma GCC optimize "trapv"`. This pragma is not necessary for this code and can be safely removed.
4. Avoid using the `using namespace std;` directive. Instead, explicitly specify the namespace for each standard library element used in the code, such as `std::cin`, `std::cout`, `std::endl`, etc.
5. Remove the `fio` macro and its usage. The `fio` macro is not necessary and can be safely removed. The `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);`, `cin.tie(NULL);`, and `cout.tie(NULL)` calls can also be removed.
6. Read the number of test cases only once. Remove the redundant `cin >> t;` inside the while loop.
7. Replace the while loop with a more efficient calculation of the number of moves. Instead of incrementing `moves` until the condition is met, use the formula `moves = (int)sqrt(2 * x);` to calculate the number of moves directly.
8. Use a single conditional statement to check for the specific condition. Instead of checking if `moves * (moves + 1) / 2 < x` and then checking if `moves * (moves + 1) / 2 == x + 1`, combine these conditions into a single statement `if (moves * (moves + 1) / 2 <= x)`.

Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>

int main() {
    int t;
    std::cin >> t;
    while (t--) {
        long long x;
        std::cin >> x;
        int moves = (int)std::sqrt(2 * x);
        if (moves * (moves + 1) / 2 <= x)
            moves++;
        std::cout << moves << std::endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
```

Please note that this optimized code block may not return the exact same output as the original code due to potential floating-point precision differences when using `sqrt` and the integer division. However, it should provide the correct result within a small margin of error.
