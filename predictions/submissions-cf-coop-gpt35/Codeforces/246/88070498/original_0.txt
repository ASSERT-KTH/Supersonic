Code Analysis:

1. The code includes unnecessary header files such as `bits/stdc++.h` which includes all standard library headers. It is recommended to include only the necessary headers to minimize compilation time and reduce memory usage.

2. The code defines macros for commonly used operations such as `all`, `pb`, `sz`, `endl`, `isOdd`, and `pow`. While these macros may improve code readability, they can also lead to potential performance issues and unexpected behavior. It is recommended to use functions or inline code instead of macros.

3. The code uses an unordered map to store the indices of each color in the `vk` variable. This can lead to inefficient memory usage and slow down the program, especially for large input sizes. It is recommended to use a more efficient data structure to store this information.

4. The code iterates over each color in `vk` and checks the number of distinct colors among its neighbors. This is done by creating a new unordered map `mp` for each color and iterating over all its members and neighbors. This approach has a time complexity of O(n^2) and can be optimized.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Replace unnecessary header inclusion: Remove the unnecessary header `bits/stdc++.h` and include only the necessary headers such as `iostream`, `vector`, `unordered_map`, and `climits`.

2. Remove unnecessary macros: Remove the macros `all`, `pb`, `sz`, `endl`, `isOdd`, and `pow` and replace them with functions or inline code.

3. Replace unordered_map with a more efficient data structure: Instead of using an unordered map to store the indices of each color, we can use a vector of vectors. This will provide better memory usage and faster access to the indices.

4. Optimize the calculation of distinct colors: Instead of creating a new unordered map `mp` for each color, we can use a vector or an array to store the count of distinct colors among the neighbors. This will avoid the need to create and update a map for each color.

5. Use compiler optimizations: Add compiler optimizations or pragma directives to hint the compiler to optimize certain parts of the code and improve performance.

Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. Remove unnecessary header inclusion:
   - Remove `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` and include the necessary headers:
     ```cpp
     #include <iostream>
     #include <vector>
     #include <unordered_map>
     #include <climits>
     ```

2. Remove unnecessary macros:
   - Remove the macros `all`, `pb`, `sz`, `endl`, `isOdd`, and `pow`.
   - Replace `endl` with `"\n"` in the `cout` statement.

3. Replace unordered_map with a more efficient data structure:
   - Replace `unordered_map<int, vector<int>> vk` with `vector<vector<int>> vk`.
   - Instead of storing the indices in an unordered map, store them directly in the vector `vk`.

4. Optimize the calculation of distinct colors:
   - Replace the unordered map `mp` with a vector or an array to store the count of distinct colors.
   - Initialize the vector or array with the maximum possible number of colors.
   - Instead of using an unordered map, use the vector or array to count the distinct colors among the neighbors.

5. Use compiler optimizations:
   - Add compiler optimizations or pragma directives to hint the compiler to optimize certain parts of the code. For example, use `-O2` or `-O3` optimization flags when compiling the code.

Optimized Code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <climits>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0);
  cin.tie(0);
  cout.tie(0);

  int n, m;
  cin >> n >> m;

  int a[n + 1];
  vector<vector<int>> vk(n + 1);

  for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    cin >> a[i];
    vk[a[i]].push_back(i);
  }

  vector<vector<int>> ad(n + 1);

  while (m--) {
    int u, v;
    cin >> u >> v;
    ad[u].push_back(v);
    ad[v].push_back(u);
  }

  int mx = 0, mxColor = INT_MAX;

  vector<int> distinctColors(n + 1, 0);

  for (auto color : vk) {
    for (auto member : color) {
      for (auto &neighbour : ad[member]) {
        if (a[neighbour] != a[member]) {
          distinctColors[a[neighbour]] = 1;
        }
      }
    }

    int count = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
      count += distinctColors[i];
      distinctColors[i] = 0;
    }

    if (count == mx && color < mxColor) {
      mxColor = color;
    } else if (count > mx) {
      mx = count;
      mxColor = color;
    }
  }

  cout << mxColor;

  return 0;
}
```

The optimized code improves performance and memory usage by using a more efficient data structure, eliminating unnecessary macros, and optimizing the calculation of distinct colors. Compiler optimizations can also be added to further improve performance.
