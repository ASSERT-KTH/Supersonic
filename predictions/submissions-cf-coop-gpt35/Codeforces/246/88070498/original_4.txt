This code can be optimized in several ways. Let's go through each optimization step one by one:

1. Remove unnecessary includes and macros:
   - The `bits/stdc++.h` header includes a large number of standard library headers, which can slow down compilation time. It's better to include only the necessary headers.
   - The macro definitions for `all()`, `pb()`, `sz()`, `isOdd()`, and `pow()` are not used in the code, so they can be removed.

2. Avoid unnecessary memory allocations:
   - The line `int a[n + 1];` allocates an array of size `n + 1`, even if `n` is very large. This can consume a significant amount of memory. Since the array is used only for reading input, it can be replaced with a vector that dynamically grows as needed.

3. Avoid unnecessary vector copies:
   - The line `vk[a[i]].push_back(i);` creates a copy of the vector stored in `vk[a[i]]` for each iteration of the loop. This can be avoided by using `emplace_back()` instead of `push_back()` to construct the vector in place.

4. Use a more efficient data structure for storing adjacency lists:
   - The current implementation uses a vector of vectors `ad` to store the adjacency lists. This can be slow for large graphs, as searching for neighbors requires iterating through all the elements of each vector. Instead, we can use an `unordered_set` to store the neighbors of each vertex, which will provide faster membership checks.

5. Avoid unnecessary map lookups:
   - The line `if (a[neighbour] != a[member]) mp[a[neighbour]] = 1;` performs a lookup in the `mp` map for each neighbor. Since the map is used only for checking membership, we can use an `unordered_set` instead, which will provide faster membership checks.

6. Avoid unnecessary sorting and comparisons:
   - The loop `for (auto color : vk)` iterates over the colors in the `vk` map. The colors are stored in an unordered map, so the order of iteration is not guaranteed to be sorted by the color value. However, the code compares `color.first` with `mxColor` to find the maximum color. To avoid unnecessary sorting and comparisons, we can use a variable `maxColor` to store the maximum color found so far, and update it whenever a color with a larger membership is found.

With these optimizations in mind, here's the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <unordered_set>
#include <climits>

using namespace std;

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0);
  cin.tie(0);
  cout.tie(0);

  int n, m;
  cin >> n >> m;

  vector<int> a(n + 1);
  unordered_map<int, vector<int>> vk;
  
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    cin >> a[i];
    vk[a[i]].emplace_back(i);
  }

  vector<unordered_set<int>> ad(n + 1);

  while (m--) {
    int u, v;
    cin >> u >> v;
    ad[u].insert(v);
    ad[v].insert(u);
  }

  int mx = 0, mxColor = INT_MAX;

  for (auto color : vk) {
    unordered_set<int> mp;

    for (auto member : color.second) {
      for (auto neighbour : ad[member]) {
        if (a[neighbour] != a[member])
          mp.insert(a[neighbour]);
      }
    }

    if (mp.size() == mx && color.first < mxColor)
      mxColor = color.first;
    else if (mp.size() > mx) {
      mx = mp.size();
      mxColor = color.first;
    }
  }

  cout << mxColor;

  return 0;
}
```

These optimizations help in improving the efficiency of the code while preserving the functionality and output of the original code.
