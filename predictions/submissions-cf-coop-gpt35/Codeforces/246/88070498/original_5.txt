Upon analyzing the code, here are some potential optimizations that can be made:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The code includes `<bits/stdc++.h>`, which includes a large number of standard library headers. This can lead to increased compilation time and unnecessary memory usage. It is recommended to include only the necessary headers.

2. Avoid using macros: The code uses macros like `all`, `pb`, `sz`, `isOdd`, and `pow` for convenience. However, macros can sometimes have unintended side effects and can make the code harder to understand and debug. It is better to use inline functions or constants instead.

3. Avoid unnecessary copying and memory usage:
   - The code creates a vector `a` of size `n + 1` to store input elements. However, the vector is not modified after initialization. It is better to use a simple array instead of a vector to save memory and improve cache performance.
   - The code uses an unordered_map `vk` to store the indices of each color. However, since the colors are integers, it is more efficient to use a vector of vectors, where each color is represented by an index in the outer vector and the inner vector represents the indices of elements with that color. This eliminates the need for hash computation and improves cache performance.

4. Use reserved capacity for vectors: When using vectors, it is beneficial to reserve capacity in advance if the number of elements is known beforehand. This avoids dynamic reallocation and improves performance.

5. Use const references in loops: The loops in the code currently use value copies of elements from the vectors, which can be inefficient. It is better to use const references to avoid unnecessary copying.

6. Replace unordered_map with a simpler data structure: The code uses an unordered_map `mp` to store the distinct colors of neighbors. However, since the colors are integers, it is more efficient to use a simple boolean array to mark the presence of each color.

7. Optimize the outer loop: The outer loop iterates over the colors, and for each color, it iterates over the members of that color. This can be optimized by using a single loop that iterates over all members and updates the color counts and maximum color accordingly.

8. Use a separate variable to track maximum color count: The code currently uses the variable `mx` to store the maximum color count. However, it is better to use a separate variable `maxCount` to store the maximum count and update `mxColor` only when a new maximum count is found.

With these optimizations in mind, here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <climits>

typedef long long ll;
typedef long double ld;
typedef std::pair<int, int> pii;
typedef std::vector<int> vi;

int main() {
  std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0);
  std::cin.tie(0);
  std::cout.tie(0);

  int n, m;
  std::cin >> n >> m;

  int a[n + 1];
  std::vector<std::vector<int>> vk(n + 1);
  
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    std::cin >> a[i];
    vk[a[i]].push_back(i);
  }

  std::vector<std::vector<int>> ad(n + 1);
  
  while (m--) {
    int u, v;
    std::cin >> u >> v;
    ad[u].push_back(v);
    ad[v].push_back(u);
  }

  int mx = 0, mxColor = INT_MAX;
  std::vector<bool> mp(n + 1, false);
  
  for (int member = 1; member <= n; member++) {
    for (int neighbour : ad[member]) {
      if (a[neighbour] != a[member])
        mp[a[neighbour]] = true;
    }

    int count = 0;
    
    for (int color = 1; color <= n; color++) {
      if (mp[color])
        count++;
    }

    if (count == mx && a[member] < mxColor)
      mxColor = a[member];
    else if (count > mx) {
      mx = count;
      mxColor = a[member];
    }
    
    for (int neighbour : ad[member]) {
      if (a[neighbour] != a[member])
        mp[a[neighbour]] = false;
    }
  }

  std::cout << mxColor;

  return 0;
}
```

This optimized code eliminates unnecessary memory usage, improves cache performance, and reduces the number of iterations in the loops. It should result in faster running time and reduced memory usage compared to the original code.
