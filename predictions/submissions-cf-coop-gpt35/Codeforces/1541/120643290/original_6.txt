The provided code appears to solve a problem for multiple test cases. It reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n`, followed by `n` pairs of integers. The code then performs some calculations on these pairs and outputs the result.

To optimize this code, we can focus on the following areas:

1. Input/Output Operations: The code uses `cin` and `cout` for input and output respectively. These operations are known to be slower than other input/output methods such as `scanf` and `printf` in C. We can replace `cin` and `cout` with `scanf` and `printf` to improve performance.

2. Unnecessary Data Structures: The code uses several data structures such as vectors and pairs. While these data structures can be convenient, they also come with some overhead in terms of memory usage and performance. We can replace certain data structures with simpler alternatives to minimize memory usage.

3. Redundant Computations: The code performs some unnecessary computations within the nested loops. We can optimize these calculations to reduce the number of operations and improve efficiency.

4. Compiler Optimizations: We can suggest compiler optimizations or pragma directives to hint the compiler to optimize certain parts of the code. This can include loop unrolling, function inlining, and compiler-specific optimizations.

Let's go through each of these optimization steps in detail.
