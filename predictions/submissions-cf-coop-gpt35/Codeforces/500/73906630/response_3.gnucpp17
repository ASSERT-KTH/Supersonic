The given code performs a graph-based sorting algorithm, where each element in the input array is associated with a set of connected elements in the graph. The algorithm starts by initializing the disjoint set data structure, which is used to efficiently merge sets and find the root of a given element. Then, it reads the input values and builds the graph by merging the sets corresponding to the connected elements. Finally, it sorts the elements within each set and outputs the sorted array.

To optimize this code, we can focus on the following areas:

1. Remove unnecessary headers: The code includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header, which includes a large number of standard C++ headers. This can result in unnecessary compilation time and increased memory usage. Instead, we can include only the necessary headers, such as `<iostream>`, `<vector>`, and `<algorithm>`.

2. Remove unused typedefs: The code includes typedefs for `ull` and `ld`, but they are not used anywhere in the code. We can remove these typedefs to improve code readability.

3. Avoid using `using namespace std`: The code uses `using namespace std`, which brings all standard library names into the global namespace. This can lead to potential naming conflicts and make the code less maintainable. Instead, we can use the `std::` prefix for standard library names.

4. Avoid using macros: The code uses macros for defining constants and shorthand notations. Macros can lead to code readability issues and can be error-prone. We can replace these macros with constant variables and inline functions.

5. Optimize disjoint set data structure: The current implementation of the disjoint set data structure uses the weighted union and path compression techniques, which have a time complexity of approximately O(log*N). However, we can further optimize this by using the union by rank and path compression techniques, which can reduce the time complexity to approximately O(alpha(N)), where alpha is the inverse Ackermann function and N is the number of elements.

6. Use a more efficient sorting algorithm: The code uses the `std::sort` function to sort the elements within each set. However, we can use a more efficient sorting algorithm, such as counting sort or radix sort, since the values within each set are non-negative integers.

7. Minimize unnecessary memory usage: The code uses multiple vectors and arrays to store intermediate results. We can minimize memory usage by reusing the same vectors and arrays where possible.
