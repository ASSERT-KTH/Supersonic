Analysis:
1. The code uses the `bits/stdc++.h` header, which includes all standard library headers. This can lead to increased compilation time and unnecessary inclusion of unused headers.
2. The code defines several macros, such as `int long long`, `IOS`, `PI`, etc. While macros can help improve code readability, they can also introduce unnecessary overhead, especially if they are used frequently.
3. The code uses a disjoint set data structure to merge connected components. However, the implementation of the disjoint set is not efficient, as it uses path compression and union by size heuristics.
4. The code sorts the elements of each connected component separately, which can be inefficient if there are many connected components.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Remove unnecessary headers: Remove the `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` directive and include only the required headers.
2. Remove unnecessary macros: Remove the macros that are not used or can be replaced by their respective values.
3. Optimize the disjoint set data structure:
    a. Use union by rank instead of union by size heuristic to improve the efficiency of merging components.
    b. Implement path compression during the `root` function to flatten the tree structure and reduce the length of the paths.
4. Optimize the sorting of connected components:
    a. Instead of sorting each connected component separately, combine all the elements of the same component into a single vector and sort it.
    b. Use a map to store the elements of each connected component, where the key is the root of the component and the value is a vector of elements.
    c. Iterate over the map to print the sorted elements.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Remove unnecessary headers:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <map>
#include <string>
```

2. Remove unnecessary macros:
```cpp
typedef unsigned long long ull;
typedef long double ld;
const int MOD = 1e9 + 7;
#define pb push_back
#define mp make_pair
#define ff first
#define ss second
#define all(a) (a).begin(), (a).end()
```

3. Optimize the disjoint set data structure:
```cpp
const int N = 400;
int parent[N];
int rank[N];

void initialize() {
  for (int i = 1; i <= N - 1; i++) {
    parent[i] = i;
    rank[i] = 0;
  }
}

int root(int i) {
  if (parent[i] != i) {
    parent[i] = root(parent[i]);
  }
  return parent[i];
}

void merge(int x, int y) {
  int u = root(x);
  int v = root(y);
  if (u != v) {
    if (rank[u] < rank[v]) {
      parent[u] = v;
    } else if (rank[v] < rank[u]) {
      parent[v] = u;
    } else {
      parent[u] = v;
      rank[v]++;
    }
  }
}
```

4. Optimize the sorting of connected components:
```cpp
int main() {
  std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  std::cin.tie(nullptr);
  std::cout.tie(nullptr);

  int n;
  std::cin >> n;
  initialize();
  
  std::vector<int> v(n + 1);
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    std::cin >> v[i];
  }
  
  std::vector<std::string> s(n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    std::cin >> s[i];
    for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
      if (s[i][j] == '1') {
        merge(i + 1, j + 1);
      }
    }
  }
  
  std::map<int, std::vector<int>> components;
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    int root_i = root(i);
    components[root_i].push_back(v[i]);
  }
  
  for (auto& component : components) {
    std::sort(all(component.second));
    for (int element : component.second) {
      std::cout << element << " ";
    }
  }
  std::cout << "\n";

  return 0;
}
```

The optimized code improves the performance by using efficient data structures and algorithms. The disjoint set data structure is optimized using union by rank and path compression. The sorting of connected components is improved by combining the elements into a single vector and using a map to store the components. The changes made preserve the functionality and output of the original code while minimizing memory usage and improving running time.
