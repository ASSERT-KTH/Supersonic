The given code appears to be implementing a disjoint set data structure to group elements based on their connectivity. The algorithm reads an integer `n` and an array `v` of size `n` representing the values associated with each element. It then reads a matrix `s` of size `n x n` representing the connectivity between elements. The algorithm merges the elements based on their connectivity and prints the values associated with each merged group in ascending order.

Let's analyze the code and identify potential areas for optimization:

1. Unnecessary includes: The code includes the entire `<bits/stdc++.h>` header, which is not recommended as it includes a large number of unnecessary headers. We can replace it with the specific headers needed for the code, such as `<iostream>`, `<vector>`, and `<algorithm>`.

2. Use of global variables: The code uses global variables extensively, which can make it harder to understand and maintain. We can consider encapsulating these variables in a class or function to improve code organization.

3. Redundant macros: The code defines macros for constants like `PI` and `MOD`, but they are not used in the code. We can remove these macros to simplify the code.

4. Inefficient data structures: The code uses an array of vectors (`v_i` and `v_e`) to store the values associated with each group. However, since the group IDs (`root(i)`) are contiguous and start from 1, we can use a single vector instead of an array of vectors. This will reduce memory usage and improve cache locality.

5. Unnecessary sorting: The code sorts the `v_e` vectors for each group, but it is not necessary. Since the groups are created based on connectivity and the elements are inserted in ascending order, the values associated with each group will already be in sorted order.

6. Inefficient root finding: The `root` function uses path compression, but it performs an unnecessary assignment `a[i] = a[a[i]]` inside the loop. We can remove this assignment to improve the root finding process.

7. Inefficient merge operation: The `merge` function swaps the group IDs if `sz[u] < sz[v]`, but this swapping is not necessary. We can always assign `a[v] = a[u]` without swapping, as it will not affect the correctness of the algorithm.

Based on these observations, let's proceed with optimizing the code step-by-step.
