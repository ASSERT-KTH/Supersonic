Analysis:
- The code consists of a function `isPrime()` that checks if a number is prime.
- The `solve()` function takes an input `n`, reads `n` integers into an array `a`, and counts the frequency of each integer using a map `m`.
- The function then iterates over the map and finds the index of the first unique element in the array `a`.
- Finally, the code reads an integer `t` and calls the `solve()` function `t` times.

Potential optimizations:
1. Improve prime number checking:
   - The `isPrime()` function checks if a number is prime using trial division up to `sqrt(n)`.
   - We can optimize this by checking for divisibility only up to `sqrt(n)` and skipping even numbers greater than 2.
   - Additionally, we can handle cases where `n` is 2 separately, as it is the only even prime number.
   - This optimization will reduce the number of iterations in the loop and improve the execution time for large input numbers.

2. Optimize finding the index of the first unique element:
   - The current code iterates over the entire array `a` for each unique element in the map `m`.
   - We can optimize this by iterating over the array only once and using a separate array to store the indices of the unique elements.
   - This will reduce the number of iterations and improve the execution time, especially for large input arrays.

3. Avoid unnecessary memory usage:
   - The code uses a fixed-size array `a` to store the input numbers.
   - We can use a vector instead of an array to avoid the need for a fixed size and potential buffer overflow.
   - This will also allow us to resize the vector dynamically based on the input size, reducing unnecessary memory usage.

4. Avoid unnecessary map iteration:
   - The code iterates over the entire map `m` to find the index of the first unique element.
   - We can optimize this by using an additional variable to keep track of the minimum index found so far.
   - Instead of iterating over the entire array `a` for each unique element, we can update the minimum index only when a new unique element is found.
   - This will reduce the number of iterations and improve the execution time, especially for large input arrays.
