Code Analysis:
- The `isPrime` function checks if a given number is prime or not. It iterates from 2 to the square root of the number to check for divisors. This function is not used in the main code.
- The `solve` function takes an input `n`, reads `n` integers into an array `a`, and then counts the frequency of each number using a `map`. It then iterates over the map and finds the first number with a frequency of 1 in the array `a`. If found, it prints the index of that number in the array. If no such number is found, it prints -1.
- The `main` function reads the number of test cases `t` and calls the `solve` function `t` times.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Avoid unnecessary includes: The `bits/stdc++.h` header includes a large number of standard library headers, which can slow down compilation and increase code size. We can replace it with specific headers that are actually required.
2. Use a more efficient prime checking algorithm: The `isPrime` function uses trial division to check for prime numbers, which has a time complexity of O(sqrt(n)). We can replace it with a more efficient algorithm, such as the Sieve of Eratosthenes, which has a time complexity of O(nloglogn).
3. Optimize the map iteration: The loop that iterates over the map can be simplified and made more efficient by using the `find` function instead of manually iterating over the elements. This will reduce the time complexity from O(n) to O(logn).
4. Use a vector instead of an array: The use of a raw array `a` can be replaced with a `vector` to avoid potential memory issues and simplify the code.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Remove unnecessary includes and add specific headers:
- Remove `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`.
- Add specific headers `#include <iostream>`, `#include <vector>`, and `#include <map>`.
2. Replace the `isPrime` function with a more efficient algorithm:
- Replace the `isPrime` function with a more efficient prime checking algorithm, such as the Sieve of Eratosthenes.
- This will eliminate the need for the `isPrime` function as it is not used in the main code.
3. Optimize the map iteration:
- Replace the loop that iterates over the map with a call to the `find` function.
- This will reduce the time complexity from O(n) to O(logn).
4. Replace the array with a vector:
- Replace the raw array `a` with a `vector` to simplify the code and avoid potential memory issues.
