After analyzing the given code, I have identified the following potential areas for optimization:

1. Inefficient data structure: The code currently uses an array to store the input elements and a map to count the frequency of each element. However, using a map is not necessary as we only need to find the first non-repeated element. We can instead use an unordered_map to store the count of each element.

2. Redundant computation: The function `isPrime` is not used anywhere in the code and can be removed.

3. Unoptimized loop: The loop to find the first non-repeated element iterates over the entire array for each unique element. This results in a time complexity of O(n^2). We can optimize this by iterating over the array once and checking the count of each element in the unordered_map.

Based on these observations, the following optimization steps can be taken:

1. Replace the `map<int, int>` with an `unordered_map<int, int>` to store the count of each element.

2. Remove the `isPrime` function as it is not used.

3. Modify the loop to find the first non-repeated element. Instead of iterating over the array for each unique element in the unordered_map, iterate over the array once and check the count of each element in the unordered_map.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

void solve() {
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  int a[n];
  unordered_map<int, int> m;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    int x;
    cin >> x;
    a[i] = x;
    m[x]++;
  }
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    if (m[a[i]] == 1) {
      cout << i + 1 << endl;
      return;
    }
  }
  cout << -1 << endl;
}

int main() {
  int t;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    solve();
  }
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized code removes unnecessary computations and uses a more efficient data structure. It preserves the functionality and output of the original code while improving the time complexity from O(n^2) to O(n).
