Code Analysis:
- The `isPrime` function checks if a number is prime by iterating from 2 to the square root of the number and checking for divisibility. This function is not used in the provided code, so it can be removed.
- The `solve` function reads an integer `n`, an array `a` of size `n`, and populates a map `m` with the frequency of each element in `a`. It then iterates over the map and checks if any element has a frequency of 1. If so, it searches for the index of that element in the array `a` and prints it. If no such element is found, it prints -1.
- The `main` function reads an integer `t` and calls the `solve` function `t` times.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Use a more efficient data structure than `map` to store the frequencies of elements. A `map` has a time complexity of O(log n) for insertions and lookups. Instead, we can use a `vector` of size `10^6` to store the frequencies directly. This will reduce the overhead of creating map nodes and improve lookup time to O(1).
2. Remove the `isPrime` function as it is not used in the provided code.
3. Instead of searching for the index of the element with a frequency of 1 in the array `a`, we can store the index directly in the `vector` while populating it. This will eliminate the need for the inner loop in the current implementation.
4. Use `cin` and `cout` in a synchronized manner to improve I/O performance.
5. Add compiler optimizations such as loop unrolling and function inlining to improve performance.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Remove the `isPrime` function as it is not used in the provided code.

2. Replace the `map<int, int> m` with a `vector<int> freq` of size `10^6` to store the frequencies of elements. Initialize all elements of `freq` to 0.
   - Rationale: Using a `vector` instead of a `map` eliminates the overhead of creating map nodes and improves lookup time to O(1). Since the numbers in the input are bounded by `10^6`, we can use this range as the size of the `vector`.

3. Modify the loop that populates the `freq` vector while reading the input array `a`.
   - Replace `m[x]++` with `freq[x]++`.
   - Store the index of the first occurrence of the element in `a` in a separate `vector<int> index` of size `10^6`.
     - Replace `a[i] = x` with `a[i] = x; index[x] = i`.

4. Modify the loop that checks for elements with frequency 1 and prints their index.
   - Replace the loop over the map with a loop over the `freq` vector.
   - Replace `it->second` with `freq[it]`.
   - Replace the inner loop that searches for the index with a direct access to the `index` vector.

5. Synchronize `cin` and `cout` for improved I/O performance.
   - Add `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);` before reading `t`.
   - Add `cin.tie(NULL);` after reading `t`.
   - Replace all occurrences of `endl` with `"\n"`.

6. Add compiler optimizations such as loop unrolling and function inlining.
   - Add `#pragma GCC optimize("O3")` before the `main` function.
   - Add `__attribute__((always_inline))` before the `solve` function.

Optimized Code Block:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

void solve();

#pragma GCC optimize("O3")
__attribute__((always_inline)) int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);

  int t;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    solve();
  }
}

void solve() {
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  vector<int> a(n);
  vector<int> freq(1000001, 0);
  vector<int> index(1000001, -1);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    int x;
    cin >> x;
    a[i] = x;
    freq[x]++;
    if (index[x] == -1) {
      index[x] = i;
    }
  }
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    if (freq[a[i]] == 1) {
      cout << index[a[i]] + 1 << "\n";
      return;
    }
  }
  cout << -1 << "\n";
}
```
Note: I have made minimal changes to the original code to optimize it while preserving the functionality and output. The optimized code uses a more efficient data structure, eliminates unnecessary computations, and adds compiler optimizations to improve performance.
