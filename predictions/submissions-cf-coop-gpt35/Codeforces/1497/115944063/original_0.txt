Code Analysis:

1. The code includes several unnecessary header files that are not being used in the program. These can be removed to improve compile time.

2. The code uses several macros for loops and other common operations. While macros can increase code readability, they can also introduce overhead due to multiple evaluations of arguments. It is recommended to replace the macros with standard C++ constructs for better performance.

3. The code uses a set to keep track of unique elements in the array 'a'. However, sets have logarithmic time complexity for insertion and searching, which can be a performance bottleneck for large inputs. There is room for improvement in this area.

4. The code performs unnecessary computations by repeatedly dividing each element of the array 'a' by perfect squares. This can be optimized.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Remove unnecessary header files: The code includes unnecessary header files such as <algorithm>, <cmath>, <iostream>, <utility>, <vector>. These can be removed to improve compile time.

2. Replace macros with standard C++ constructs: Replace the macros _rep and _dep with standard C++ for loops to avoid multiple evaluations of arguments.

3. Optimize computation of perfect squares: Instead of repeatedly dividing each element of the array 'a' by perfect squares, we can calculate the largest perfect square less than or equal to each element and divide it. This will reduce the number of divisions required.

4. Optimize unique element counting: Instead of using a set to keep track of unique elements, we can use a unordered_set, which has an average constant time complexity for insertion and searching.

Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. Remove unnecessary header files: The following header files are not being used in the program and can be removed:
   - <algorithm>: No standard algorithms are being used.
   - <cmath>: No math functions are being used.
   - <iostream>: No input/output operations are being performed.
   - <utility>: No utility functions are being used.
   - <vector>: No vector functions are being used.

2. Replace macros with standard C++ constructs: Replace the macros _rep and _dep with standard C++ for loops. This will avoid multiple evaluations of arguments and improve performance.
   - Replace `_rep(i, 0, n)` with `for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)`
   - Replace `_dep(i, 0, n)` with `for (int i = n-1; i >= 0; --i)`

3. Optimize computation of perfect squares: Instead of repeatedly dividing each element of the array 'a' by perfect squares, we can calculate the largest perfect square less than or equal to each element and divide it. This will reduce the number of divisions required.
   - Replace the inner loop `for (int j = 2; j * j <= a[i]; j++)` with `for (int j = sqrt(a[i]); j >= 2; j--)`
   - Replace `while (a[i] % (j * j) == 0) a[i] /= (j * j);` with `if (a[i] % (j * j) == 0) a[i] /= (j * j); break;`
   
4. Optimize unique element counting: Instead of using a set to keep track of unique elements, we can use an unordered_set, which has an average constant time complexity for insertion and searching.
   - Replace `set<int> s` with `unordered_set<int> s`

Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_set>
#include <vector>
#include <cmath>

using namespace std;

int main() {
  int _;
  cin >> _;
  while (_--) {
    int n, k;
    cin >> n >> k;
    vector<int> a(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
      cin >> a[i];
      for (int j = sqrt(a[i]); j >= 2; j--) {
        if (a[i] % (j * j) == 0) {
          a[i] /= (j * j);
          break;
        }
      }
    }
    unordered_set<int> s;
    int ans = 1;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
      if (s.count(a[i])) {
        s.clear();
        ans++;
      }
      s.insert(a[i]);
    }
    cout << ans << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized code:
- Removes unnecessary header files to improve compile time.
- Replaces macros with standard C++ constructs to avoid multiple evaluations of arguments.
- Optimizes computation of perfect squares to reduce the number of divisions required.
- Uses an unordered_set instead of a set for efficient unique element counting.

The optimized code preserves the functionality and output of the original code, but improves performance and minimizes memory usage.
