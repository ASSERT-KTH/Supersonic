The given code reads an integer `t` and then calls the function `fun()` `t` times. In each iteration of `fun()`, it reads an integer `n`, followed by `n` integers. It then performs some calculations on the input integers and prints the final result.

Let's analyze the code to identify potential areas for optimization:

1. The `set<int> f` is used to store unique values of `a[i]`. However, the set is cleared after `ans++` is executed. Instead of clearing the set, we can initialize a new set in each iteration.

2. The loop `for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)` can be optimized. The current implementation checks if `a[i]` is already present in the set `f`. If it is, it increments `ans` and clears the set. This can be optimized by keeping track of the previous value of `a[i]` and comparing it directly with the current value. If they are different, we increment `ans` and clear the set.

3. The prime factorization logic can be optimized. Currently, it iterates from 2 to the square root of `a[i]` to find the prime factors. However, we can optimize this by only iterating up to the square root of the maximum value in the input array `a[]`.

4. The `#define` statements can be replaced with standard C++ code to improve code readability.
