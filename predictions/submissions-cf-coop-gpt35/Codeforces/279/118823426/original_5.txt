The provided code appears to solve a problem that involves finding the maximum length of a subarray whose sum is less than or equal to a given value. However, the code could be optimized to improve its efficiency. Here's the step-by-step optimization strategy:

1. Remove Unnecessary Includes: The code includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header, which is not necessary. We can remove it and include the necessary headers explicitly.

2. Remove Unused Type Definitions: The code defines several type aliases (`typedef`) that are not used in the program. We can remove them to simplify the code.

3. Avoid Using `using namespace std;`: The code currently uses the `using namespace std;` directive, which is generally considered bad practice. It is better to prefix the standard library types with `std::` to avoid potential naming conflicts.

4. Optimize Input/Output: The code uses `cin` and `cout` for input and output operations, respectively. While they are convenient, they can be slower than other input/output methods. We can use a faster input/output mechanism, such as `scanf` and `printf`, to improve performance.

5. Avoid unnecessary calculations in the `gcd` and `lcm` functions: The `gcd` and `lcm` functions can be optimized by removing unnecessary calculations. For example, if `a` is zero in the `gcd` function, we can return `b` directly without any calculations. Similarly, if `a` or `b` is zero in the `lcm` function, we can return zero directly.

6. Optimize the `pow` function: The `pow` function can be optimized using exponentiation by squaring. This method reduces the number of multiplications required to calculate the power.

7. Optimize the `modexp` function: The `modexp` function can also be optimized using exponentiation by squaring and taking modulo at each step. This reduces the overall computation time.

8. Use a more efficient data structure for `b`: The code uses an array `b` to store the cumulative sum of elements in `a`. Instead of an array, we can use a `vector` to dynamically allocate memory and avoid unnecessary memory usage.

9. Optimize the calculation of `maxlen`: The code currently uses an upper bound search (`upper_bound`) to find the index of the first element greater than `to`. This search can be optimized by using a binary search (`lower_bound`), as the `b` array is sorted.

10. Remove unnecessary curly braces: The code uses curly braces for the main block of code, which is unnecessary and can be removed.

Now, let's apply these optimizations to the original code:
