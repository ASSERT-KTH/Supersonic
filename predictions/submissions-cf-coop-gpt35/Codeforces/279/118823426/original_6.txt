The given code calculates the maximum length of a contiguous subarray whose sum is less than or equal to a given value `t`. The code uses an array `a` to store the input values and an array `b` to store the cumulative sums of the elements of `a`. It then uses a loop to iterate through each element of `b` and find the maximum subarray length.

Here are some potential optimizations that can be applied to improve the efficiency of this code:

1. Array Initialization: The line `ll b[n + 1] = {0};` initializes the array `b` with all zeros. However, since the array is subsequently filled with the cumulative sums of `a`, this initialization is unnecessary. Instead of initializing the array with zeros, we can simply declare it as `ll b[n + 1];`.

2. Upper Bound Search: The current code uses the `upper_bound` function to find the first element greater than `to` in the array `b`. However, since `b` is a sorted array, we can use binary search to find the upper bound in logarithmic time complexity instead of linear time complexity. This can significantly improve the performance, especially for large input sizes.

3. Variable Types: The code uses `ll` as the variable type for various variables, including `n`, `t`, `a`, `b`, `sum`, and `maxlen`. However, some of these variables can be declared as `int` instead of `ll` since their values are within the range of an `int`.

4. Loop Optimization: The loop `rep(i, 1, n + 1)` iterates through each element of `b`, but it can be optimized to start from `i=0` instead of `i=1` since `b[0]` is always zero. This change will simplify the loop condition and remove the need to subtract `i` to calculate the length.

5. Remove Unused Variables: The code defines several typedefs and macros that are not used in the given program. These can be removed to simplify the code and improve readability.

Taking these optimizations into account, the optimized code would look like this:
