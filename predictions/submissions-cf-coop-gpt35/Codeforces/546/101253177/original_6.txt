Upon analyzing the provided code, the following potential optimizations can be identified:

1. Unnecessary includes: The code includes both `<bits/stdc++.h>` and `<stdio.h>`, which is redundant as `<bits/stdc++.h>` already includes `<stdio.h>`. We can remove the include statement for `<stdio.h>`.

2. Redundant variable initialization: The variable `long k` is initialized to 0 but is immediately overwritten by the value read from `cin`. We can remove the initialization statement.

3. Unoptimized arithmetic operations: The expression `n = n * (n + 1) / 2` can be optimized. Currently, it calculates the sum of numbers from 1 to `n` using the formula `(n * (n + 1)) / 2`. However, this can be simplified to `(n * (n + 1)) >> 1` using right shift operator instead of division.

4. Redundant assignment: The variable `n` is assigned the value `n * d`, but this assignment is unnecessary. We can directly use `n * d` in the subsequent calculations and condition check.

5. Redundant if-else check: The condition `if ((n - k) > 0)` is unnecessary. We can directly output the result `n - k` without the conditional check, as the result will be non-negative.

Based on these observations, the optimized code can be written as follows:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  int d;
  std::cin >> d;

  long k;
  std::cin >> k;

  long n;
  std::cin >> n;

  n = (n * (n + 1)) >> 1;
  n *= d;

  std::cout << (n - k);

  return 0;
}
```

These optimizations improve the code by removing redundant operations and unnecessary condition checks. The code is now more concise and efficient, without sacrificing functionality or output.
