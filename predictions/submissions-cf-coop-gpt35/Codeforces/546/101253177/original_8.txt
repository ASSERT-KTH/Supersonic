The given code calculates a value `n` using the formula `n = n * (n + 1) / 2`. It then multiplies `n` by `d` and checks if the result minus `k` is greater than zero. If so, it prints the difference, otherwise, it prints "0".

To optimize this code, we can focus on the following areas:

1. Avoid unnecessary includes: The code includes both `bits/stdc++.h` and `stdio.h`. We can remove the unnecessary `bits/stdc++.h` include since it includes a large number of standard library headers, which can slow down compilation times.

2. Use more efficient data types: The code uses `long` data type for `k` and `n`. However, for the given problem, `int` should be sufficient and more memory-efficient.

3. Avoid redundant computations: The code performs two unnecessary calculations. First, it calculates `n * (n + 1) / 2` and assigns the result back to `n`. This can be simplified to just `n = (n * (n + 1)) / 2`. Second, it multiplies `n` by `d` and assigns the result back to `n`. We can avoid this redundant assignment and directly perform the subtraction: `n -= k`.

4. Use a conditional expression instead of if-else: Instead of using an if-else statement to check if `n - k` is greater than zero, we can use a conditional expression to simplify the code.

Here's the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  int d = 0;
  std::cin >> d;

  int k = 0;
  std::cin >> k;

  int n = 0;
  std::cin >> n;

  n = (n * (n + 1)) / 2;
  n -= k;

  std::cout << (n > 0 ? n : 0);

  return 0;
}
```

These optimizations result in a more efficient and concise code. The optimized code eliminates unnecessary includes, uses more memory-efficient data types, avoids redundant computations, and simplifies the conditional statement. The trade-off is a slightly increased code complexity due to the conditional expression, but the overall performance should be improved.
