The provided code seems to calculate a mathematical expression and then checks if the result is greater than a given value. If the result is greater, it prints the difference; otherwise, it prints 0. 

Here are some potential optimizations that can be applied to this code:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The code includes both `<bits/stdc++.h>` and `<stdio.h>`, but only the latter is used. We can remove the `<bits/stdc++.h>` include statement.

2. Remove unused variables: The variable `k` is declared but never used. We can remove this variable from the code.

3. Avoid unnecessary multiplication: The expression `n * (n + 1) / 2` can be simplified. Instead of calculating the sum of the first `n` numbers using this formula, we can use the formula `n * (n + 1) / 2` directly.

4. Use an if-else statement instead of a conditional expression: Instead of using `(n - k) > 0 ? n - k : 0`, we can use a simple if-else statement to make the code more readable.

Based on these optimizations, here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  int d = 0;
  std::cin >> d;

  int n = 0;
  std::cin >> n;

  n = n * (n + 1) / 2;
  n = n * d;

  if (n > 0) {
    std::cout << n;
  } else {
    std::cout << "0";
  }

  return 0;
}
```

This optimized code eliminates unnecessary includes, removes unused variables, simplifies the mathematical expression, and replaces the conditional expression with an if-else statement. These optimizations improve the code's readability and may result in a small performance gain.
