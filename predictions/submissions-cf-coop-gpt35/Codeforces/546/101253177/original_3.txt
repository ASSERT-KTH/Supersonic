Code Analysis:
The provided code calculates the sum of numbers from 1 to n and then multiplies it with d. It then checks if the result is greater than k and prints the difference if it is positive, otherwise it prints 0.

Potential Bottlenecks:
1. Unnecessary inclusion of `<bits/stdc++.h>` and `<stdio.h>` headers. Only `<iostream>` is required for input/output operations.
2. Using `long` data type for variables `k` and `n` when `int` would suffice.
3. Redundant calculation of `n * (n + 1) / 2` before multiplying it with `d`. This can be simplified and optimized.
4. Using conditional statements for printing the result, instead of a direct print statement.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Remove unnecessary inclusion of headers.
2. Change the data type of variables `k` and `n` from `long` to `int`.
3. Optimize the calculation of `n` by removing the intermediate step of calculating the sum of numbers from 1 to n. Instead, directly calculate the sum as `n * (n + 1) / 2`.
4. Replace the conditional statement with a direct print statement.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Remove the inclusion of unnecessary headers `<bits/stdc++.h>` and `<stdio.h>`. Only `<iostream>` is required for input/output operations.
2. Change the data type of variables `k` and `n` from `long` to `int` to save memory.
3. Optimize the calculation of `n` by removing the intermediate step of calculating the sum of numbers from 1 to n. Instead, directly calculate the sum as `n * (n + 1) / 2`. This reduces the number of arithmetic operations required.
4. Replace the conditional statement with a direct print statement. Instead of checking if `(n - k) > 0`, directly print the result as `max(n - k, 0)`. This simplifies the code and avoids unnecessary branching.

Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  int d = 0;
  std::cin >> d;

  int k = 0;
  std::cin >> k;

  int n = 0;
  std::cin >> n;

  n = n * (n + 1) / 2 * d;
  std::cout << std::max(n - k, 0) << std::endl;

  return 0;
}
```

This optimized code reduces unnecessary arithmetic operations and removes redundant conditional statements, resulting in improved performance and reduced memory usage.
