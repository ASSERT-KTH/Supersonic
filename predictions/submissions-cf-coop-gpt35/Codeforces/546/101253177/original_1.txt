Analysis:
The code reads three inputs from the user (`d`, `k`, and `n`) and performs some calculations to compute the value of `n`. It then checks if `n - k` is greater than 0 and prints the result.

1. Potential Performance Bottleneck:
   - The code uses the `bits/stdc++.h` header, which includes all standard C++ libraries. This can increase compilation time and unnecessary memory usage. It's better to include only the necessary headers.
   - The code uses `cin` and `cout` for input and output operations. These operations can be slower compared to other input/output methods, such as using `scanf` and `printf`.

2. Optimization Strategy:
   1. Replace the `bits/stdc++.h` header with only the necessary headers.
   2. Replace the `cin` and `cout` operations with `scanf` and `printf` for faster input/output.
   3. Simplify the calculation of `n` by removing unnecessary multiplication operations.
   4. Avoid unnecessary if-else statement by directly printing the result.

3. Step-by-Step Explanation:
   1. Replace the `bits/stdc++.h` header with only the necessary headers:
      - The `bits/stdc++.h` header includes all standard C++ libraries, which can increase compilation time and unnecessary memory usage. Instead, include only the necessary headers, such as `iostream` and `cstdio`.
   2. Replace the `cin` and `cout` operations with `scanf` and `printf`:
      - `cin` and `cout` operations can be slower compared to `scanf` and `printf` for input/output operations. Replace the `cin >> d` with `scanf("%d", &d)` and `cout << n - k` with `printf("%ld", n - k)`.
   3. Simplify the calculation of `n`:
      - The expression `n = n * (n + 1) / 2` can be simplified to `n = (n * (n + 1)) / 2` to avoid unnecessary multiplication operations.
   4. Avoid unnecessary if-else statement:
      - Instead of using an if-else statement to check if `n - k` is greater than 0 and then print the result, directly print the result using `printf("%ld", n - k)`.

4. Optimized Code Block:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cstdio>

int main() {
  int d = 0;
  scanf("%d", &d);

  long k = 0;
  scanf("%ld", &k);

  long n = 0;
  scanf("%ld", &n);

  n = (n * (n + 1)) / 2;
  n *= d;

  printf("%ld", n - k);
}
```
The optimized code eliminates unnecessary headers, replaces `cin` and `cout` with `scanf` and `printf`, simplifies the calculation of `n`, and directly prints the result without using an if-else statement. This code should have improved performance and reduced memory usage compared to the original code.
