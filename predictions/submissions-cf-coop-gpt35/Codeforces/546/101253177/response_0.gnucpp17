The given code appears to calculate a value 'n' based on user inputs 'd' and 'k', and then checks if 'n - k' is greater than 0. If it is, it prints the result; otherwise, it prints "0".

To optimize this code, we can make the following improvements:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The code includes both `<bits/stdc++.h>` and `<stdio.h>`, but only the latter is required. We can remove the unnecessary `<bits/stdc++.h>` include.

2. Remove unnecessary variable assignments: The variable 'n' is assigned the result of the expression `n * (n + 1) / 2`. However, this is not needed as 'n' is overwritten in the next line. We can remove this assignment.

3. Simplify the 'if' condition: The 'if' condition `(n - k) > 0` can be simplified to `n > k`. This eliminates the need for the subtraction operation.

4. Optimize input and output operations: The code currently uses `cin` for input and `cout` for output. These operations can be slower compared to their C counterparts `scanf` and `printf`. We can replace the input and output statements with `scanf` and `printf` respectively to improve efficiency.
