The provided code calculates `n * (n + 1) / 2` and then multiplies the result by `d`. It then checks if the result minus `k` is greater than 0 and prints the difference if it is, or prints 0 otherwise.

To optimize this code, we can make the following improvements:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The code includes both `<bits/stdc++.h>` and `<stdio.h>`, which is redundant. We can remove the `<stdio.h>` include since we are not using any functions from it.

2. Optimize input/output: The code uses `cin` and `cout` for input and output operations. These operations are generally slower than their C counterparts (`scanf` and `printf`). We can replace `cin` and `cout` with `scanf` and `printf` respectively to improve the performance.

3. Simplify the logic: Instead of calculating `n * (n + 1) / 2` and then multiplying it by `d`, we can simplify the calculation by directly multiplying `n` by `n + 1` and dividing it by 2, and then multiplying the result by `d`. This eliminates the need for two separate calculations and reduces the number of operations.

4. Optimize the conditional check: The code checks if `(n - k) > 0` and prints the difference if true, or prints 0 otherwise. We can optimize this by using a ternary operator to directly print the result without the need for the conditional check.

Here's the optimized code with the above improvements:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  int d = 0;
  std::scanf("%d", &d);

  long k = 0;
  std::scanf("%ld", &k);

  long n = 0;
  std::scanf("%ld", &n);

  long result = d * n * (n + 1) / 2;

  std::printf("%ld", result > k ? result - k : 0);

  return 0;
}
```

These optimizations improve the performance of the code by simplifying the logic and using faster input/output operations. They also reduce the code complexity and make it more readable.
