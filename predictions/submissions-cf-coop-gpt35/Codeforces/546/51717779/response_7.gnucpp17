After analyzing the given code, we can identify a few potential areas for optimization:

1. The use of the `bits/stdc++.h` header: This header includes a large number of standard library headers, which can lead to unnecessary memory usage and longer compile times. It is better to include only the specific headers that are needed.

2. The use of `int_least64_t` for `k`: Since `k` is a loop variable, it is unnecessary to use a 64-bit integer type. A regular `int` type should suffice.

3. The loop structure: The current loop structure iterates from 1 to `w`, and for each iteration, it performs a multiplication and an addition. This can be optimized by using a closed-form formula to calculate the sum of the arithmetic series.

4. The use of `cout` for output: The current code uses multiple `cout` statements to output the result. This can be optimized by using a single `cout` statement.

Based on these observations, we can propose the following optimization strategy:

1. Replace the `bits/stdc++.h` header with the specific headers needed (`iostream` and `cstdint` for `int_least64_t`).

2. Change the type of `k` from `int_least64_t` to `int`.

3. Replace the loop structure with a closed-form formula to calculate the sum of the arithmetic series.

4. Use a single `cout` statement to output the result.
