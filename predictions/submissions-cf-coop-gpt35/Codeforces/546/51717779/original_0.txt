The given code calculates the total cost of buying w items, where the price of the first item is k, the price of the second item is 2k, the price of the third item is 3k, and so on. It then checks if the total cost is less than or equal to n, and if so, it outputs 0. Otherwise, it outputs the difference between the total cost and n.

To optimize this code, we can make the following improvements:

1. Remove unnecessary header inclusion: The code includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header, which is not recommended as it includes all the standard library headers. We should only include the necessary headers, such as `<iostream>`, which is required for input/output operations.

2. Avoid using `int_least64_t` for k, n, and w: The code uses the `int_least64_t` data type for k, n, and w, which is an unnecessarily large data type. Since the input constraints are not specified, we can assume that int will suffice for these variables.

3. Use a formula to calculate the sum: Instead of using a loop to calculate the sum, we can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: `sum = (n / 2) * (first_term + last_term)`. In this case, the first term is k and the last term is w * k. This formula will greatly reduce the number of iterations required.

4. Optimize the conditional check: Instead of checking if `dem <= n` and then subtracting n from dem, we can directly calculate the difference between dem and n and store it in a variable. We can then output this variable.

Here's the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  int k, n, w;
  std::cin >> k >> n >> w;

  // Calculate the sum using the arithmetic series formula
  int sum = (w * (w + 1) / 2) * k;

  // Calculate the difference between the sum and n
  int difference = sum - n;

  // Output the result
  if (difference <= 0) {
    std::cout << 0;
  } else {
    std::cout << difference;
  }

  return 0;
}
```

By using the arithmetic series formula, we reduce the number of iterations required from `w` to a constant number of operations. This leads to a significant improvement in performance. Additionally, the code is simplified by removing unnecessary variables and redundant checks.
