The provided code calculates the total cost of buying `w` items, where the price of the `i`th item is `i * k`. Then, it checks if the total cost is less than or equal to `n`, and if so, it outputs 0. Otherwise, it outputs the difference between the total cost and `n`.

To optimize this code, we can make the following improvements:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The code includes the entire `bits/stdc++.h` header, which is not necessary and can slow down the compilation process. We can remove it and include only the necessary headers, such as `<iostream>`.

2. Use a more efficient data type: The variable `dem` is currently of type `int_least64_t`, which is an unnecessarily large data type for this calculation. We can use a smaller data type, such as `int64_t`, to save memory.

3. Optimize the loop: The loop calculates the sum of `i * k` for each `i` from 1 to `w`. This can be optimized by using the arithmetic sum formula `n * (n + 1) / 2`, where `n` is the number of items (`w`). We can simplify the loop to a single calculation using this formula.

4. Remove unnecessary if-else statement: The if-else statement can be simplified to a single output statement by calculating the difference between `dem` and `n` directly.

5. Add compiler optimization hints: We can use compiler optimizations, such as loop unrolling and optimization flags, to further improve the performance of the code.

Here's the optimized code with the above improvements:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  int64_t k, n, w;
  std::cin >> k >> n >> w;

  int64_t dem = (w * (w + 1) / 2) * k;

  std::cout << std::max(0LL, dem - n) << std::endl;

  return 0;
}
```

By making these optimizations, we have reduced the memory usage by using a smaller data type and simplified the calculation by using the arithmetic sum formula. The code is also more readable and performs the same functionality as the original code.
