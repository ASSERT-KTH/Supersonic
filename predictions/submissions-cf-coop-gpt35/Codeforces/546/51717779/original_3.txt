The provided code calculates the total cost of buying w items, with the cost of each item increasing by a constant factor k. It then checks if the total cost is greater than n and prints the difference if it is, otherwise it prints 0.

To optimize this code, we can focus on the following areas:

1. Unnecessary Include: The code includes the entire "bits/stdc++.h" library, which can slow down compilation time. Since we only need the iostream library for input/output operations, we can replace the include statement with "#include <iostream>".

2. Avoiding Unnecessary Multiplications: The current code performs unnecessary multiplications inside the loop. Instead of multiplying i by k in each iteration, we can calculate the sum of an arithmetic progression using the formula (w * (w + 1) / 2) * k. This reduces the number of multiplications from w to just one.

3. Avoiding Overflow: The code uses int_least64_t for the variables, which is an appropriate choice for large numbers. However, we can optimize further by using a different formula that avoids the need for large integer types altogether. By simplifying the sum formula, we can calculate the result in constant time using only integer operations.

4. Compiler Optimization: We can use compiler optimizations to hint the compiler to optimize the code further. In C++, we can use the "constexpr" keyword to indicate that a function or variable can be evaluated at compile time. Additionally, we can use the "-O2" optimization flag during compilation to enable more aggressive optimizations.

With these optimizations in mind, let's proceed with the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  int k, n, w;
  std::cin >> k >> n >> w;

  // Calculate the sum of an arithmetic progression
  int sum = w * (w + 1) / 2;

  // Calculate the total cost
  int totalCost = sum * k;

  // Check if the total cost is greater than n
  int difference = (totalCost <= n) ? 0 : (totalCost - n);

  std::cout << difference;

  return 0;
}
```

In this optimized code, we have eliminated unnecessary multiplications inside the loop, avoided the use of large integer types, and made use of a simplified formula to calculate the result in constant time. Additionally, we have removed the unnecessary include statement and added comments to explain the changes.
