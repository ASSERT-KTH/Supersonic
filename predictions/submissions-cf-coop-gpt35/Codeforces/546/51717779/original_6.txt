The given code calculates the total cost of buying w items, where the price of the i-th item is equal to i * k. It then checks if the total cost is greater than n and outputs the difference if it is, or 0 otherwise. 

To optimize this code, we can make the following changes:

1. Remove unnecessary `#include` statement: The code includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header, which is not a standard header and can slow down compilation time. We can remove this line since it is not used in the code.

2. Use a more efficient data type: The variable `dem` is declared as `int_least64_t`, which is an 8-byte signed integer. However, since the value of `dem` is always positive, we can use an unsigned integer instead to save memory. We can change the type of `dem` to `uint_least64_t`.

3. Optimize the loop: The loop currently iterates from 1 to w and accumulates the cost of each item. Instead of calculating the cost of each item individually, we can use a mathematical formula to calculate the total cost in constant time. The sum of the first w natural numbers can be calculated as (w * (w + 1)) / 2. We can then multiply this sum by k to get the total cost. This optimization eliminates the need for a loop and reduces the time complexity from O(w) to O(1).

4. Simplify the if-else statement: The if-else statement can be simplified to a single line using the ternary operator. This makes the code more concise and easier to read.

Here's the optimized code with the above changes implemented:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  uint_least64_t k, n, w;
  std::cin >> k >> n >> w;

  uint_least64_t total_cost = (w * (w + 1) / 2) * k;
  uint_least64_t difference = (total_cost <= n) ? 0 : total_cost - n;

  std::cout << difference;

  return 0;
}
```

By making these optimizations, we have improved the efficiency of the code by eliminating unnecessary computations and reducing memory usage. The time complexity has been reduced from O(w) to O(1), and the code is now more readable and concise.
