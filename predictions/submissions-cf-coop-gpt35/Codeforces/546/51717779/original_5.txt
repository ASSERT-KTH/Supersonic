The provided code calculates the total cost to buy a certain number of items. It takes three inputs: `k` (the cost of the first item), `n` (the total amount of money available), and `w` (the number of items to buy). The code calculates the total cost by summing up the cost of each item from 1 to `w`. If the total cost is less than or equal to the available money (`n`), it outputs 0. Otherwise, it outputs the difference between the total cost and the available money.

To optimize this code, we can make the following changes:

1. Replace the `bits/stdc++.h` header with the specific headers needed for the program. Using `bits/stdc++.h` is not recommended as it includes a large number of unnecessary headers, which can increase compilation time.

2. Use a more efficient data type for `k`, `n`, and `w`. The code currently uses `int_least64_t` which is a 64-bit signed integer. However, a regular `int` would be sufficient for the range of values used in this program.

3. Avoid unnecessary calculations. The code currently calculates `i * k` in each iteration of the loop. However, this can be optimized by calculating the sum of the first `w` natural numbers (`sum_w`) and then multiplying it by `k` outside the loop. This can be done using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: `sum_w = w * (w + 1) / 2`.

4. Remove unnecessary code. The code currently has unnecessary curly braces around the `else` part of the `if` statement. These can be removed to reduce clutter.

Taking these optimizations into account, the optimized code would look like this:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  int k, n, w;
  std::cin >> k >> n >> w;

  // Calculate the sum of the first w natural numbers
  int sum_w = w * (w + 1) / 2;

  // Calculate the total cost
  int total_cost = sum_w * k;

  if (total_cost <= n) {
    std::cout << 0;
  } else {
    std::cout << total_cost - n;
  }

  return 0;
}
```

These optimizations improve the performance of the program by avoiding unnecessary calculations and using more efficient data types. The optimized code is also simpler and easier to understand.
