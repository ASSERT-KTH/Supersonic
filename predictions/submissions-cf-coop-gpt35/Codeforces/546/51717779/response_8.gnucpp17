The given code calculates the total cost of buying w items, where the price of the first item is k, the second item is 2k, and so on. It then checks if the total cost is greater than n and outputs the difference.

To optimize this code, we can make the following improvements:

1. Use a more efficient data type: The code uses `int_least64_t` for the variables k, n, and w. However, since the input values are small integers, we can safely use `int` instead.

2. Eliminate unnecessary computation: In the for loop, the code calculates `i * k` for each iteration. This can be optimized by calculating `dem` using the arithmetic sum formula instead of a loop. The sum of the first w natural numbers is given by `w * (w + 1) / 2`, so we can calculate `dem` as `dem = w * (w + 1) / 2 * k`.

3. Simplify the conditional statement: Instead of checking if `dem` is less than or equal to n and then subtracting n from it, we can simplify the code by directly calculating the difference and outputting it. If `dem` is less than or equal to n, the difference will be 0, and if `dem` is greater than n, the difference will be `dem - n`.
