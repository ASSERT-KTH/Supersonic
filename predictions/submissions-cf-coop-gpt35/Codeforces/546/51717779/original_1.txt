Analysis:
- The code reads three integers `k`, `n`, and `w` from the user.
- It then calculates the sum of arithmetic series from 1 to `w` with a common difference of `k`, and stores the result in the variable `dem`.
- Finally, it checks if `dem` is less than or equal to `n` and prints either 0 or the difference between `dem` and `n`.

Potential optimizations:
1. Remove unnecessary header inclusion: The code includes `<bits/stdc++.h>`, which is a non-standard header and includes a large number of other headers. This can significantly increase compilation time and memory usage. It is recommended to include only the necessary headers, such as `<iostream>`, instead.

2. Avoid unnecessary arithmetic operations: The calculation of the sum of the arithmetic series can be simplified using a formula. Instead of iterating from 1 to `w`, we can directly compute the sum using the formula: `dem = (w * (w + 1) / 2) * k`.

3. Avoid unnecessary conditional statement: Instead of checking if `dem` is less than or equal to `n`, we can directly calculate the difference between `dem` and `n` and print the result.

4. Use more appropriate data types: The code uses `int_least64_t` for `k`, `n`, and `w`, which may be unnecessary. `int_least64_t` is a 64-bit signed integer type, but the problem statement does not specify any constraints on the input values. It is recommended to use smaller integer types, such as `int` or `long long`, unless there is a specific requirement for larger values.

Optimization steps:
1. Remove unnecessary header inclusion:
   - Remove the line `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`.
   - Add the necessary headers, such as `#include <iostream>`, to ensure the code still compiles and runs correctly.

2. Simplify the calculation of the sum of the arithmetic series:
   - Replace the for loop with the formula `dem = (w * (w + 1) / 2) * k`.

3. Remove unnecessary conditional statement:
   - Replace the if-else statement with a single line of code: `cout << max(0, dem - n);`.

4. Use appropriate data types:
   - Change the data types of `k`, `n`, and `w` to `int` or `long long`, depending on the expected range of input values.

Optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int k, n, w;
  cin >> k >> n >> w;
  long long dem = (w * (w + 1) / 2) * k;
  cout << max(0LL, dem - n);
  return 0;
}
```
