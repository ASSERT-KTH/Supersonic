Code Analysis:
1. The code includes unnecessary header files, such as `<bits/stdc++.h>`, which slows down the compilation process.
2. The `using namespace std;` statement is used, which can lead to naming conflicts and make the code less readable.
3. The macros `all(x)`, `sz(x)`, `f`, `s`, `m_p`, and `pw(x)` are defined, but it is not clear how they are used in the code. They should be reviewed for their necessity.
4. The `tox` and `toy` arrays are used to represent the four directions (up, down, left, right). However, they are only used once in the code and can be replaced with direct values.
5. The `val` array is initialized with consecutive integers. This can be done more efficiently using a loop.
6. The `is` array is used to mark numbers as composite. However, it is not necessary to mark all composite numbers. Only the prime numbers need to be marked, and their multiples can be calculated directly.
7. The `cnt` array is used to store the prime factors of each number. It can be optimized by using a bitset instead of an integer array.
8. The `pref` array is used to store the prefix sum of the `cnt` array. It can be optimized by calculating the prefix sum directly in the same loop where the `cnt` array is calculated.
9. The `precalc` function is called once at the beginning of the program to initialize the arrays. It can be moved inside the `main` function to avoid unnecessary function calls.
10. The `signed` keyword before the `main` function is unnecessary.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Remove unnecessary header files to speed up compilation time.
2. Remove the `using namespace std;` statement and use the `std::` prefix for standard library functions and types to improve code readability and avoid naming conflicts.
3. Review the macros `all(x)`, `sz(x)`, `f`, `s`, `m_p`, and `pw(x)` to determine if they are necessary. If not, remove them.
4. Replace the `tox` and `toy` arrays with direct values in the code to eliminate unnecessary array accesses.
5. Optimize the initialization of the `val` array by using a loop instead of assigning consecutive integers.
6. Optimize the prime number calculation by marking only the prime numbers and calculating their multiples directly.
7. Replace the `cnt` array with a bitset to store the prime factors of each number more efficiently.
8. Optimize the calculation of the `pref` array by calculating the prefix sum directly in the same loop where the `cnt` array is calculated.
9. Move the `precalc` function inside the `main` function to avoid unnecessary function calls.
10. Remove the `signed` keyword before the `main` function.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Remove unnecessary header files:
   - Remove the line `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` as it includes unnecessary header files and slows down compilation time.

2. Remove the `using namespace std;` statement:
   - Replace `using namespace std;` with `std::` prefix for standard library functions and types. For example, replace `cin` with `std::cin` and `cout` with `std::cout`.

3. Review and remove unnecessary macros:
   - Review the macros `all(x)`, `sz(x)`, `f`, `s`, `m_p`, and `pw(x)` to determine if they are necessary. If not, remove them.

4. Replace `tox` and `toy` arrays with direct values:
   - Replace the `tox` array with direct values `{1, -1, 0, 0}`.
   - Replace the `toy` array with direct values `{0, 0, 1, -1}`.

5. Optimize initialization of the `val` array:
   - Replace the loop `for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) { val[i] = i; }` with `std::iota(val, val + N, 0);` to initialize the `val` array with consecutive integers more efficiently.

6. Optimize prime number calculation:
   - Replace the loop `for (int i = 2; i < to; i++) { ... }` with the following optimized code:
     ```
     for (int i = 2; i * i < N; i++) {
       if (is[i]) continue;
       for (int j = i * i; j < N; j += i) {
         is[j] = true;
       }
     }
     ```
     This code marks only the prime numbers and calculates their multiples directly, eliminating unnecessary composite number marking.

7. Replace `cnt` array with bitset:
   - Replace the `cnt` array with a `std::bitset<N>` to store the prime factors of each number more efficiently. The `cnt` array can be replaced with `std::bitset<N> cnt`.

8. Optimize the calculation of the `pref` array:
   - Modify the loop `for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) { ... }` as follows:
     ```
     for (int i = 2; i < N; i++) {
       if (!is[i]) {
         cnt[i]++;
         for (int j = 2 * i; j < N; j += i) {
           is[j] = true;
           cnt[j]++;
         }
       }
       pref[i] = pref[i - 1] + cnt[i];
     }
     ```
     This modification calculates the prefix sum of the `cnt` array directly in the same loop, eliminating the separate loop for calculating the prefix sum.

9. Move `precalc` function inside `main` function:
   - Move the `precalc` function inside the `main` function to avoid unnecessary function calls. The `precalc` function can be moved just before the `int t;` line.

10. Remove the `signed` keyword before the `main` function:
    - Remove the `signed` keyword before the `main` function as it is unnecessary.

Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <numeric>
#include <bitset>

const int N = 5e6 + 2;

int val[N];
std::bitset<N> is;
std::bitset<N> cnt;
long long pref[N];

void precalc() {
  std::iota(val, val + N, 0);
  
  for (int i = 2; i * i < N; i++) {
    if (is[i]) continue;
    for (int j = i * i; j < N; j += i) {
      is[j] = true;
    }
  }
  
  for (int i = 2; i < N; i++) {
    if (!is[i]) {
      cnt[i]++;
      for (int j = 2 * i; j < N; j += i) {
        is[j] = true;
        cnt[j]++;
      }
    }
    pref[i] = pref[i - 1] + cnt[i];
  }
}

int main() {
  std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  std::cin.tie(nullptr);
  std::cout.tie(nullptr);
  
  precalc();
  
  int t;
  std::cin >> t;
  
  while (t--) {
    int a, b;
    std::cin >> a >> b;
    std::cout << pref[a] - pref[b] << '\n';
  }
  
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized code eliminates unnecessary header files, improves code readability, and optimizes various parts of the code to reduce running time and memory usage.
