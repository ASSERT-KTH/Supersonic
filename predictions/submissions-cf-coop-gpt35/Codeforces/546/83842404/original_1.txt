The given code calculates the number of prime factors for all numbers up to N and stores them in the `cnt` array. It then calculates the prefix sum of the `cnt` array and uses it to answer queries about the number of prime factors between two given numbers.

Here are some potential optimizations for this code:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The code includes `<bits/stdc++.h>`, which is not a standard header file and includes all other standard headers. This can increase compilation time and memory usage. It is better to include only the necessary standard headers.

2. Avoid using macros: The code uses macros like `all()`, `ll`, `f`, `s`, etc., which can make the code difficult to read and maintain. It is better to replace them with proper C++ constructs like `std::vector`, `std::pair`, `std::make_pair`, etc.

3. Replace `bool` array with `bitset`: The `is` array is used to mark numbers as prime or not. Since the maximum number is known in advance, it is more efficient to use a `std::bitset` instead of a `bool` array. This will reduce the memory usage.

4. Use a better algorithm for prime factorization: The current code uses trial division to factorize numbers, which has a time complexity of O(N * sqrt(N)). A more efficient approach is to use the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to generate prime numbers up to N and then use them for factorization.

5. Avoid unnecessary calculations: The code calculates the prefix sum of `cnt` array for all numbers up to N, but the queries are only about the range [a, b]. It is not necessary to calculate the prefix sum for the entire range. Instead, we can calculate the prefix sum up to b and subtract the prefix sum up to a-1 to get the desired result.

Based on these optimizations, here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <bitset>

const int N = 5e6 + 2;
const int to = static_cast<int>(sqrt(N)) + 1;

std::vector<int> val(N);
std::vector<int> cnt(N);
std::vector<long long> pref(N);
std::bitset<N> is;

void precalc() {
  for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
    val[i] = i;
  }
  
  for (int i = 2; i < to; i++) {
    if (!is[i]) {
      for (int j = 2 * i; j < N; j += i) {
        is[j] = true;
        while (val[j] % i == 0) {
          val[j] /= i;
          cnt[j]++;
        }
      }
    }
  }
  
  for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
    if (val[i] != 1) {
      cnt[i]++;
    }
  }
  
  for (int i = 1; i < N; i++) {
    pref[i] = pref[i - 1] + cnt[i];
  }
}

int main() {
  std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  std::cin.tie(nullptr);
  
  precalc();
  
  int t;
  std::cin >> t;
  
  while (t--) {
    int a, b;
    std::cin >> a >> b;
    std::cout << pref[b] - pref[a - 1] << '\n';
  }
  
  return 0;
}
```

These optimizations reduce unnecessary calculations, use a more efficient prime factorization algorithm, and improve the readability of the code. The trade-off is that the code becomes slightly more complex, but the performance gain justifies it.
