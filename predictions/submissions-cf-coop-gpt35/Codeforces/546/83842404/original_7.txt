The provided code calculates the number of prime factors for each number in the range [1, N] and stores the cumulative sum of prime factors in the `pref` array. It then takes input values `a` and `b` and outputs the difference between `pref[a]` and `pref[b]`. 

To optimize this code, we can make the following improvements:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` includes a large number of libraries, which may increase the compilation time and memory usage. We should only include the necessary headers, which in this case are `<iostream>` and `<vector>`.

2. Replace macros with inline functions: Macros like `all(x)`, `sz(x)`, and `pw(x)` can be replaced with inline functions. Inline functions provide type safety and avoid potential issues that may arise from using macros.

3. Optimize the prime factorization loop: The current implementation checks for prime factors using trial division. However, we can optimize this process by using the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to mark all the prime numbers in the range [2, N]. Then, we can iterate over the primes and mark their multiples as composite numbers. This will reduce the number of iterations required in the main loop.

4. Replace the `val` array with a vector: The `val` array is used to store the current value of each number during the prime factorization loop. However, using a vector instead of an array will allow us to dynamically allocate memory and avoid wasting memory for unused indices.

5. Optimize the calculation of `pref` array: Instead of calculating the cumulative sum of prime factors for each number individually, we can optimize this process by using the prefix sum algorithm. This algorithm allows us to calculate the cumulative sum in linear time complexity.

6. Use `reserve` function for vector: Before entering the main loop, we can use the `reserve` function of the `vector` class to preallocate memory for the `pref` vector. This will reduce the number of reallocations and improve performance.

7. Remove unnecessary checks and assignments: The current implementation checks if `val[i] != 1` and increments `cnt[i]` for each number `i` in the range [0, N]. However, since all numbers in the range [0, N] will either be prime or have a prime factorization, we can remove these checks and assignments.

8. Use `'\n'` instead of `endl`: The use of `endl` flushes the output stream, which can significantly decrease performance. Instead, we can use `'\n'` to insert a newline character without flushing the stream.

With these optimizations in mind, here's the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <cmath>

using namespace std;

const int N = 5e6 + 2;

vector<int> val;
vector<bool> is;
vector<int> cnt;
vector<long long> pref;

void precalc() {
  val.resize(N, 0);
  is.resize(sqrt(N) + 1, false);
  cnt.resize(N, 0);
  pref.resize(N, 0);

  for (int i = 2; i * i < N; i++) {
    if (!is[i]) {
      for (int j = i * i; j < N; j += i) {
        is[j] = true;
      }
    }
  }

  for (int i = 2; i < N; i++) {
    if (!is[i]) {
      for (int j = i; j < N; j += i) {
        val[j]++;
      }
    }
  }

  for (int i = 1; i < N; i++) {
    pref[i] = pref[i - 1] + val[i];
  }
}

inline int getPrimeFactors(int n) {
  return val[n];
}

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(nullptr);
  cout.tie(nullptr);

  precalc();

  int t;
  cin >> t;

  while (t--) {
    int a, b;
    cin >> a >> b;
    cout << pref[a] - pref[b] << '\n';
  }

  return 0;
}
```

By following the optimization steps above, we have reduced unnecessary computations, improved memory usage, and streamlined the code for better performance.
