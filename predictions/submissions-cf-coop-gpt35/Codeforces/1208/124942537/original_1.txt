The given code appears to solve a problem where we need to find the minimum length of a subarray such that removing that subarray from the original array makes all the remaining elements distinct.

Upon analyzing the code, we can identify a few potential areas for optimization:

1. Unnecessary Data Structures: The code uses several unnecessary data structures, such as the `vec`, `vecl`, `vecp`, `umap`, and `uset` typedefs. These data structures are not used in the code and can be removed.

2. Redundant Computations: The code calculates the size of the input array `n` multiple times. It would be more efficient to calculate it once and store the value in a variable.

3. Inefficient Loop: The nested loop used to find the minimum length of the subarray can be optimized. Currently, it iterates over all possible subarrays, which results in a time complexity of O(n^3). We can improve this by using a sliding window technique, which reduces the time complexity to O(n^2).

4. Compiler Optimizations: We can use compiler optimizations, such as loop unrolling and function inlining, to improve the code's performance. We can also consider enabling compiler optimizations, such as `-O2` or `-O3` flags, to allow the compiler to perform additional optimizations.

Based on these observations, let's proceed with optimizing the code step by step.
