The given code is a C++ program that reads an integer `n` followed by `n` integers from the standard input. It then calculates the minimum number of integers that need to be removed from the array such that the remaining integers are distinct. The program outputs the minimum number of removals. 

Let's analyze the code for potential optimizations:

1. Unnecessary Header Files: The code includes the entire `bits/stdc++.h` header file, which includes a large number of standard library header files. This can lead to increased compile times and unnecessary memory usage. We should only include the specific header files that are required for the program.

2. Use of Macros: The code uses macros for defining common data types and operations. While macros can provide convenience, they can also make the code harder to read and maintain. It is better to use explicit typedefs or `using` statements instead of macros.

3. Inefficient Data Structures: The code uses an unordered map to keep track of the frequency of each integer in the array. However, the use of an unordered map is not necessary for this problem. We can simply use an array to keep track of the frequency of each integer.

4. Redundant Data Structures: The code creates a temporary unordered map `temp` in each iteration of the outer loop. This is unnecessary and can be avoided by using a single unordered map `m` and resetting its values in each iteration.

5. Inefficient Looping: The code uses nested loops to iterate over the array and check if removing a substring results in distinct integers. This leads to a time complexity of O(n^3), which can be improved.

6. Compiler Optimizations: We can enable compiler optimizations to improve the performance of the code. This can include using optimization flags during compilation or using `#pragma` directives to guide the compiler.

Based on these observations, we can propose the following optimization strategy:

1. Remove unnecessary header files.
2. Replace macros with explicit typedefs or `using` statements.
3. Replace the unordered map with an array to track the frequency of each integer.
4. Remove the creation of the temporary unordered map `temp` and reset the values of the main unordered map `m` in each iteration.
5. Optimize the nested loops to reduce the time complexity.
6. Enable compiler optimizations.

Let's proceed with implementing these optimizations step by step.
