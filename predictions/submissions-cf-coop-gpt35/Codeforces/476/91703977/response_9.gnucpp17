Code Analysis:
1. The code includes many unnecessary or redundant header files, such as `bits/stdc++.h` and the `pb_ds` headers. These should be removed to improve compilation time and reduce unnecessary dependencies.
2. There are several unnecessary macros defined, such as `int long long`, `ll long long`, etc. These macros are not used in the code and should be removed.
3. The `initialize` function initializes a 2D array `l` with the values of binomial coefficients. However, this array is not used anywhere in the code. Therefore, the `initialize` function and the `l` array can be removed.
4. The `nCr` function computes binomial coefficients using the `l` array. However, this function is not used in the code and can be removed.
5. The `solve` function takes input strings `a` and `b`, performs some calculations, and outputs a probability value. The logic of this function seems correct, but there might be some opportunities for optimization.
6. There are several unnecessary print statements and debug macros (`dbg`) that are only used when `ONLINE_JUDGE` is not defined. These should be removed.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Remove unnecessary header files and macros to reduce compilation time and dependencies.
2. Remove the `initialize` function, the `l` array, and the `nCr` function since they are not used.
3. Optimize the `solve` function to improve performance and reduce unnecessary calculations.
4. Remove unnecessary print statements and debug macros.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Remove unnecessary header files and macros:
   - Remove `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` since it is not a standard C++ header and includes unnecessary dependencies.
   - Remove `#include <ext/pb_ds/assoc_container.hpp>` and `#include <ext/pb_ds/detail/standard_policies.hpp>` since they are not used in the code.
   - Remove `#include <ext/pb_ds/tree_policy.hpp>` since it is not used in the code.
   - Remove the `fastio` macro since it is not used in the code.
   - Remove the `int long long` and `ll long long` macros since they are not used in the code.

2. Remove unnecessary code:
   - Remove the `initialize` function, the `l` array, and the `nCr` function since they are not used in the code.

3. Optimize the `solve` function:
   - Remove the unused `ld prob` variable.
   - Remove the unused `apos` and `bpos` variables.
   - Remove the unused `desc` macro.
   - Simplify the calculation of `diff` by using `count(begin(a), end(a), '+') - count(begin(a), end(a), '-')` instead of a loop.
   - Simplify the calculation of `amb` by using `count(begin(b), end(b), '?')` instead of a loop.
   - Simplify the calculation of `r` by using `count(begin(b), end(b), '+') - count(begin(b), end(b), '-')` instead of a loop.
   - Simplify the condition `amb == 0 and diff == 0` to `amb == 0 && diff == 0`.
   - Simplify the condition `amb == 0 and diff != 0` to `amb == 0 && diff != 0`.
   - Simplify the condition `((amb + diff) & 1 or (u < 0 or v < 0))` to `(amb + diff) & 1 || u < 0 || v < 0`.
   - Use `std::pow` instead of `pow` to avoid ambiguity.
   - Use `std::setprecision` and `std::fixed` instead of `setprecision` and `fixed`.

4. Remove unnecessary print statements and debug macros:
   - Remove the `hr` macro since it is not used in the code.
   - Remove the `deb` macro since it is not used in the code.
   - Remove the `dbg` macro and the `__f` function since they are not used in the code.
