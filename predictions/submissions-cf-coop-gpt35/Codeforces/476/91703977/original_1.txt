Code Analysis:
- The code includes various header files, which suggest the use of different libraries and data structures.
- The code includes a lot of preprocessor directives, defining macros for various operations.
- The code uses a 2D array `l` to store the values of nCr coefficients. The array is initialized with the values using a nested loop. This suggests that the code might be calculating nCr coefficients for some purpose.
- The code reads two strings `a` and `b` from the input.
- The code counts the number of '+' and '-' characters in `a` to determine the initial position (`apos`).
- The code counts the number of '?' characters in `b` to determine the number of ambiguous positions (`amb`).
- The code calculates the difference between `apos` and the number of '+' characters in `b` (`r`).
- The code calculates the values of `u` and `v` based on `amb` and `diff`.
- The code calculates the probability `prob` based on `u`, `v`, and `amb`.
- The code prints the value of `prob` to the output.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Remove unnecessary header files: The code includes a lot of unnecessary header files that are not used. These should be removed to reduce compile time and minimize memory usage.
2. Simplify and optimize the calculation of nCr coefficients: The code uses a 2D array `l` to store the values of nCr coefficients. This can be simplified by using a combination function that calculates the value directly without storing it in an array.
3. Optimize the calculation of `apos` and `r`: The code currently counts the number of '+' and '-' characters in `a` and `b` using a loop. This can be optimized by using the `count` algorithm from the `<algorithm>` header.
4. Optimize the calculation of `u` and `v`: The code currently uses division and subtraction operations to calculate `u` and `v`. These operations can be replaced with simpler arithmetic operations for better performance.
5. Optimize the calculation of `prob`: The code currently uses the `pow` and `nCr` functions to calculate `prob`. These functions can be replaced with more efficient alternatives to improve performance.
6. Remove unnecessary output statements: The code includes unnecessary output statements for debugging purposes. These statements should be removed to improve performance.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Remove unnecessary header files:
   - Remove the unused header files `ext/pb_ds/assoc_container.hpp`, `ext/pb_ds/detail/standard_policies.hpp`, and `ext/pb_ds/tree_policy.hpp`.
   
2. Simplify and optimize the calculation of nCr coefficients:
   - Remove the `initialize` function and the 2D array `l`.
   - Replace the `nCr` function with a more efficient implementation using the formula nCr = n! / (r! * (n-r)!).
   
3. Optimize the calculation of `apos` and `r`:
   - Replace the loop that counts the number of '+' and '-' characters in `a` and `b` with the `count` algorithm from the `<algorithm>` header.
   - Replace the lines `apos += i == '+';` and `apos -= i == '-';` with `apos += count(a.begin(), a.end(), '+');` and `apos -= count(a.begin(), a.end(), '-');` respectively.
   - Replace the line `r += i == '+'; r -= i == '-';` with `r += count(b.begin(), b.end(), '+'); r -= count(b.begin(), b.end(), '-');`.
   
4. Optimize the calculation of `u` and `v`:
   - Replace the line `int u = (amb + diff) / 2;` with `int u = (amb + diff) >> 1;` to perform division by 2 using bitwise right shift.
   - Replace the line `int v = amb - u;` with `int v = amb - (amb + diff) >> 1;` to optimize the calculation of `v`.
   
5. Optimize the calculation of `prob`:
   - Replace the line `ld q = pow(2, amb);` with `ld q = 1 << amb;` to calculate 2^amb using bitwise left shift.
   - Replace the line `ld p = nCr(amb, u);` with `ld p = 1; for (int i = 1; i <= u; i++) p *= (amb - i + 1) / i;` to calculate nCr directly without using a separate function.
   
6. Remove unnecessary output statements:
   - Remove the `dbg` and `__f` macros, as well as the `deb` macro, as they are not used in the code.
   - Remove the `hr` macro, as it is not necessary for the functionality of the code.
