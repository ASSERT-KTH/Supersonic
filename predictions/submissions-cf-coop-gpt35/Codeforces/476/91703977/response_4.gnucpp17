Upon analyzing the given code, we can identify several areas for potential optimization:

1. Unnecessary includes: The code includes several unnecessary header files, such as `bits/stdc++.h` and `ext/pb_ds/...`. These can be removed to reduce compile time.

2. Unused macros: There are several macros defined in the code that are not used. Removing these macros can make the code cleaner and easier to read.

3. Redundant code: The code contains redundant code for printing separators (`hr`) and debugging (`dbg`). These can be removed to improve the performance.

4. Inefficient data structure: The code uses a 2D array `l` to store values for calculating combinations. However, this array is not necessary and can be replaced with a more efficient approach.

5. Unoptimized loops: The code contains loops that can be optimized to improve performance. For example, the loop in the `initialize` function can be optimized using loop unrolling.

6. Compiler optimizations: The code can benefit from compiler optimizations such as loop unrolling, vectorization, and function inlining. We can use compiler-specific pragmas to hint the compiler to apply these optimizations.

Based on these observations, we can propose the following optimization strategy:

1. Remove unnecessary includes and unused macros.

2. Remove redundant code for printing separators and debugging.

3. Improve the efficiency of calculating combinations by replacing the 2D array with a more efficient approach.

4. Optimize loops by applying loop unrolling and other loop optimizations where possible.

5. Apply compiler optimizations using pragmas to improve performance.

Let's now go through each optimization step in detail:

1. Remove unnecessary includes and unused macros:
   - Remove the following includes: `bits/stdc++.h`, `ext/pb_ds/assoc_container.hpp`, `ext/pb_ds/detail/standard_policies.hpp`, `ext/pb_ds/tree_policy.hpp`.
   - Remove unused macros: `int` (redefining `long long` as `int`), `ll`, `ld`, `vi`, `pii`, `vpii`, `uset`, `umap`, `maxpq`, `minpq`, `part`, `rev`, `sz`, `def`, `def0`, `minv`, `maxv`, `sumv`, `lb`, `ub`, `desc`, `pb`, `mp`, `F`, `S`, `mod`, `inf`, `infty`, `md`, `PI`, `endl`, `rr`, `br`, `hr`, `gcd`, `lcm`, `setbits`, `leadzero`, `trailzero`, `ip`, `op`, `deb`, `ordered_set`.

2. Remove redundant code:
   - Remove the `hr` function for printing separators.
   - Remove the `dbg` macro for debugging.

3. Improve efficiency of calculating combinations:
   - Replace the 2D array `l` with a more efficient approach, such as using the `nCr` function directly without precalculating all values. This can be done by modifying the `nCr` function to use a dynamic programming approach to calculate combinations on the fly.

4. Optimize loops:
   - Optimize the loop in the `initialize` function by using loop unrolling. This can be done by processing the loop in chunks of 4 or 8 iterations at a time, reducing the number of loop iterations and improving cache utilization.

5. Apply compiler optimizations:
   - Add compiler-specific pragmas to enable optimizations such as loop unrolling, vectorization, and function inlining. For example, use `#pragma GCC optimize("Ofast")` to enable aggressive optimization.
