Code Analysis:

1. The code includes a large number of unnecessary preprocessor directives and macros that do not contribute to performance optimization. These directives and macros should be removed.

2. The code includes unnecessary header files that are not used in the program. These header files should be removed.

3. The code uses a 2D array `l` to calculate the values of binomial coefficients. However, this array is not necessary and can be replaced with a more efficient approach.

4. The code uses the `pow` function to calculate a power of 2. This function is computationally expensive and can be replaced with a bitwise shift operation.

5. The code uses floating-point arithmetic (`ld`) for probability calculations. However, using floating-point arithmetic for precise calculations can lead to inaccuracies. It would be better to use integer arithmetic and avoid floating-point calculations whenever possible.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Remove unnecessary preprocessor directives and macros to simplify the code and improve readability.

2. Remove unnecessary header files to reduce compilation time and memory usage.

3. Replace the 2D array `l` with a more efficient algorithm to calculate binomial coefficients.

4. Replace the `pow` function with a bitwise shift operation to calculate powers of 2.

5. Replace floating-point arithmetic with integer arithmetic wherever possible to improve accuracy and performance.

Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. Remove unnecessary preprocessor directives and macros:

   - Remove the `#pragma comment(linker, "/stack:200000000")` directive as it is not necessary for performance optimization.
   - Remove the `#pragma GCC optimize("Ofast")` directive as it may enable aggressive optimizations that could affect the correctness of the program.
   - Remove the `#pragma GCC target("sse,sse2,sse3,ssse3,sse4,avx,avx2")` directive as it is not necessary for performance optimization.
   - Remove the `#include <ext/pb_ds/assoc_container.hpp>` and `#include <ext/pb_ds/detail/standard_policies.hpp>` header files as they are not used in the program.

   ```cpp
   #include <bits/stdc++.h>
   using namespace std;
   ```

2. Replace the 2D array `l` with a more efficient algorithm to calculate binomial coefficients:

   - The current approach uses a 2D array to store the values of binomial coefficients. However, this approach has a space complexity of O(n^2), which can be improved.
   - We can use the multiplicative formula for binomial coefficients to calculate them efficiently.
   - Remove the `l` array and the `initialize` function.
   - Replace the `nCr` function with a more efficient implementation:

   ```cpp
   int nCr(int n, int r) {
     if (r > n - r) {
       r = n - r;
     }
     int result = 1;
     for (int i = 0; i < r; i++) {
       result *= (n - i);
       result /= (i + 1);
     }
     return result;
   }
   ```

3. Replace the `pow` function with a bitwise shift operation to calculate powers of 2:

   - The `pow` function is computationally expensive and can be replaced with a bitwise shift operation when calculating powers of 2.
   - Replace the line `ld q = pow(2, amb);` with `ld q = 1 << amb;` to calculate the value of `q`.

4. Replace floating-point arithmetic with integer arithmetic wherever possible:

   - The code uses floating-point arithmetic (`ld`) for probability calculations. However, using floating-point arithmetic for precise calculations can lead to inaccuracies.
   - Replace the `ld` data type with `int` for the `prob` variable.
   - Modify the `cout` statement to set the precision for integer output: `cout << fixed << setprecision(15) << prob << endl;`.
