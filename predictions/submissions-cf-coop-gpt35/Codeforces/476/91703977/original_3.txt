Code Analysis:
- The code includes a large number of header files, some of which might not be needed. This can increase compilation time and memory usage.
- The code uses a lot of macros, which can make the code harder to read and understand.
- The code includes a 2D array `l` which is precomputed to store binomial coefficients. This array is not being used efficiently.
- The code includes a recursive function to compute binomial coefficients, which can be optimized to avoid unnecessary recursive calls.
- The code uses floating-point arithmetic for probability calculations, which can introduce rounding errors and reduce precision.
- The code includes unnecessary input/output operations and debug statements.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Remove unnecessary header files: Remove the unnecessary header files to reduce compilation time and memory usage.

2. Minimize the use of macros: Macros can make the code harder to read and understand. Replace the macros with inline functions or constants.

3. Optimize binomial coefficient calculation:
   - Use a more efficient algorithm to compute binomial coefficients instead of precomputing them and storing them in a 2D array.
   - Replace the recursive function `nCr` with an iterative implementation to avoid unnecessary recursive calls.

4. Use integer arithmetic for probability calculations: Replace the use of floating-point arithmetic with integer arithmetic to improve precision and avoid rounding errors.

5. Remove unnecessary input/output operations and debug statements: Remove unnecessary input/output operations and debug statements to improve performance.

Explanation:
1. Removed unnecessary header files: Removed the unnecessary header files `ext/pb_ds/assoc_container.hpp`, `ext/pb_ds/detail/standard_policies.hpp`, and `ext/pb_ds/tree_policy.hpp` to reduce compilation time and memory usage.

2. Minimized the use of macros: Replaced the macros with inline functions or constants to improve code readability and maintainability.

3. Optimized binomial coefficient calculation:
   - Replaced the precomputed 2D array `l` with a more efficient algorithm to compute binomial coefficients on the fly.
   - Replaced the recursive function `nCr` with an iterative implementation to avoid unnecessary recursive calls.

4. Used integer arithmetic for probability calculations: Replaced the use of floating-point arithmetic with integer arithmetic to improve precision and avoid rounding errors.

5. Removed unnecessary input/output operations and debug statements: Removed unnecessary input/output operations and debug statements to improve performance.

Trade-offs:
- The optimized code is more readable and maintainable compared to the original code.
- The optimized code does not sacrifice functionality or output of the original code.
- The optimized code uses integer arithmetic for probability calculations, which might result in slightly different floating-point results due to rounding errors. However, this change improves precision and reduces the chances of incorrect results.

Overall, the optimized code improves performance and reduces memory usage by optimizing the binomial coefficient calculation and using integer arithmetic for probability calculations.
