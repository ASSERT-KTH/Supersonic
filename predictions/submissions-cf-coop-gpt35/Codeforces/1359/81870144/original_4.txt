The given code appears to be a solution to a dynamic programming problem. The goal is to find the maximum sum of values in a two-dimensional map, where each position can be reached by moving either right or down. The code uses a nested loop to iterate over all possible positions and calculate the maximum sum for each position.

Upon initial analysis of the code, the following potential performance bottlenecks and inefficient memory usage can be identified:

1. Inefficient use of data structures: The code uses a vector of long long integers, `a`, to store the input values. However, the values of `a` are only accessed once and do not need to be stored in a vector. It would be more memory-efficient to read the input values directly into temporary variables.

2. Redundant calculations: The code iterates over the range of -30 to 30 twice, once for each nested loop. However, the range of -30 to 30 is the same in both loops and does not change. It would be more efficient to calculate this range only once and store it in a variable.

3. Inefficient memory allocation: The code uses a map of maps, `dp`, to store the maximum sums for each position. However, the map is allocated for each position in the outer loop, resulting in unnecessary memory allocations. It would be more efficient to allocate the map once outside the loop and update its values for each position.

4. Unnecessary ternary operator: In the inner loop, the code uses a ternary operator to check if `dp[i][j]` is non-zero before subtracting `j` from it. However, this check is unnecessary because the map `dp` is initialized with zeros. The subtraction can be done directly without the ternary operator.

To optimize the code, the following steps can be taken:

1. Remove the vector `a` and read the input values directly into temporary variables.
2. Calculate the range of -30 to 30 only once and store it in a variable.
3. Allocate the map `dp` outside the loop and update its values for each position.
4. Remove the ternary operator and subtract `j` directly from `dp[i][j]` in the inner loop.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <map>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int n;
  cin >> n;

  int a;
  map<int, long long> dp;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> a;
    for (int j = -30; j <= 30; j++) {
      int to = max(a, j);
      dp[to] = max(dp[to], dp[j] + a);
    }
  }

  long long ans = 0;
  for (int j = -30; j <= 30; j++) {
    ans = max(ans, dp[j] - j);
  }

  cout << ans << endl;
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized code reduces memory usage by removing the unnecessary vector and uses a more efficient map allocation strategy. It also eliminates redundant calculations and unnecessary checks, resulting in improved performance.
