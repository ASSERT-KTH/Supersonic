The given code appears to be a solution to a dynamic programming problem. However, there are several areas in the code that can be optimized to improve its performance and reduce memory usage.

1. Unnecessary Includes: The code includes the entire `<bits/stdc++.h>` header, which is not recommended as it can slow down the compilation process. Instead, it is better to include only the necessary headers. In this case, we only need `<iostream>` and `<vector>`.
2. Unused Macros: There are several macros defined in the code that are not used. These include `LOCAL`, `fi`, `se`, `vi_a`, `p_b`, `pll`, `m_p`, `getfiles`, `pw`, `rall`, `eps`, `pi`, `inf`, `mod2`, `mod1`, `sqr`, `qb`, `gcd`, `binpow`, `binmult`, `R`, `tx`, `ty`, and `rev_to`. Removing these unused macros will make the code cleaner and more readable.
3. Redundant Code: The code contains some redundant or unnecessary computations. For example, the `sqr` and `qb` functions are not used anywhere in the code. Removing such unused functions can improve the code's efficiency.
4. Inefficient Data Structure: The code uses a `map` to store the dynamic programming table `dp`. However, using a `vector` instead of a `map` can significantly improve memory usage and access times, as the indices are sequential and do not require a mapping. Additionally, initializing the `vector` with the maximum possible size (`N`) can improve performance by avoiding frequent reallocations.
5. Loop Bounds: The loops that iterate over `j` in the code have a fixed range from -30 to 30. However, the values of `a[i]` are not constrained within this range. To avoid unnecessary iterations, the loop bounds for `j` can be modified to `j = -30; j <= a[i] + 30`.
6. Compiler Optimizations: Enabling compiler optimizations can often lead to significant performance improvements. Adding compiler optimization flags, such as `-O2` or `-O3`, can instruct the compiler to apply various optimization techniques, such as loop unrolling, function inlining, and constant propagation.
