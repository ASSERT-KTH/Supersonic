The given code is a C++ program that calculates the maximum sum of an increasing subsequence from a given array. The program uses a dynamic programming approach to solve the problem. However, there are several areas where the code can be optimized:

1. Unnecessary Includes: The code includes the entire `<bits/stdc++.h>` library, which is not recommended. Instead, include only the necessary standard libraries that are actually used in the code.

2. Unused Pragma Directives: The code includes pragma directives for debugging purposes (`#ifdef LOCAL`), which are not required for the final optimized code. These directives can be removed.

3. Redundant Macros: The code defines several macros that are not used in the program (`vi_a`, `p_b`, `pll`, `pii`, `m_p`, `pw`, `ld`, `eps`, `R`, `tx`, `ty`, `rev_to`). These macros can be removed to simplify the code.

4. Inefficient Data Structure: The code uses a map of maps (`map<ll, long long> dp[N];`) to store the dynamic programming table. This data structure has a high overhead and can be replaced with a more efficient data structure, such as a 2D array.

5. Unnecessary Loop: The code uses a loop to iterate over the range `(-30, 30)` to calculate the maximum sum. However, the array `a` contains positive integers, so there is no need to consider negative values. The loop can be simplified to iterate over the range `(0, 30)` instead.

6. Unnecessary Comparison: The code compares `dp[i][j]` with 0 in the inner loop to calculate the maximum sum. Since `dp[i][j]` is always non-negative, the comparison is unnecessary and can be removed.

7. Unused Variables: The variables `tx`, `ty`, and `mod2` are defined but not used in the code. These variables can be safely removed.

8. Redundant Functions: The functions `sqr`, `qb`, `gcd`, `binpow`, and `binmult` are defined but not used in the code. These functions can be safely removed.

Now, let's proceed with the optimization steps one by one.
