Upon analyzing the given code, I have identified several potential areas for optimization:

1. Unnecessary includes: The code includes the entire `<bits/stdc++.h>` header, which is not recommended as it increases compilation time. Instead, we should include only the necessary headers.

2. Redundant functions and variables: There are several functions and variables defined in the code that are not used. These should be removed to improve code clarity and reduce memory usage.

3. Inefficient data structures: The code uses vectors extensively. While vectors are generally efficient, they may not be the best choice for certain scenarios. We should assess whether there are better data structures that can provide faster access or reduce memory overhead.

4. Inefficient loops and computations: There are several loops and computations in the code that can be optimized. For example, there are loops with unnecessary checks for the value of 'm' that can be eliminated.

5. Compiler optimizations: We can also suggest compiler optimizations or pragma directives to hint the compiler to optimize certain parts of the code.
