Code Analysis:
- The code defines a number of helper functions for various mathematical operations such as calculating prime factors, exponentiation, gcd, lcm, etc.
- The `calc_sieve()` function calculates a sieve array to efficiently find prime numbers.
- The `primefactor()` function populates the `lp` array with the lowest prime factor for each number up to `N`.
- The `test()` function takes two inputs `n` and `m`, and generates a list of edges for a graph, based on certain conditions.
- The `main()` function initializes the prime factorization and calls the `test()` function.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Remove unnecessary includes: The code includes the entire `bits/stdc++.h` header, which can slow down compilation time. Instead, include only the necessary headers such as `<iostream>`, `<vector>`, `<algorithm>`, and `<utility>`.

2. Minimize the usage of `using namespace std;`: While convenient, this can lead to name clashes and make the code less readable. Instead, explicitly qualify the standard library types and functions with `std::`.

3. Avoid unnecessary memory allocations and deallocations:
   - The `edges` vector is resized multiple times within the `test()` function. Instead, pre-allocate enough space for the maximum number of edges to avoid unnecessary reallocations.
   - Use `reserve()` to allocate memory for the `edges` vector based on the expected number of edges, which is `n-1` for the first loop and `m` for the second loop.

4. Optimize the prime factorization:
   - The `primefactor()` function calculates the lowest prime factor for each number up to `N` using the sieve array. Instead of using a separate sieve array, we can modify the `lp` array to store the lowest prime factor directly.
   - Use a more efficient algorithm to calculate the prime factors. Instead of iterating over all primes less than or equal to `lp[i]`, we can directly calculate the prime factors by dividing `i` by `lp[i]` until it becomes 1.

5. Use more efficient data structures:
   - Instead of using a vector to store prime numbers (`pr`), use a `std::set` to store them in sorted order. This will simplify the code and allow for faster lookups.
   - Instead of using a vector for the sieve array (`sieve`), use a `std::bitset` to reduce memory usage. A bitset can efficiently store boolean values for each number in a compact manner.

6. Optimize the loop iterations:
   - In the first loop of the `test()` function, the range of the loop can be reduced to `n-2` instead of `n-1` since the last edge is added separately.
   - In the second loop of the `test()` function, the range of the loop can be reduced to `n-1` instead of `n` since the last node is already covered in the previous loop.

7. Use more efficient arithmetic operations:
   - Instead of using `pow()` function for exponentiation, use a custom `binpow()` function that uses bitwise operations to perform exponentiation in logarithmic time.
   - Use the modulus operator `%` to reduce the result in each step of the `binpow()` function.

8. Optimize I/O operations:
   - Use `'\n'` instead of `std::endl` for line breaks to avoid unnecessary flushing of the output buffer.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Remove unnecessary includes:
   - Remove the `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` line.
   - Include only the necessary headers: `<iostream>`, `<vector>`, `<algorithm>`, and `<utility>`.

2. Minimize the usage of `using namespace std;`:
   - Replace `using namespace std;` with explicit using declarations for the standard library types and functions used in the code.

3. Avoid unnecessary memory allocations and deallocations:
   - Add `edges.reserve(n-1 + m);` before the first loop in the `test()` function to pre-allocate memory for the `edges` vector.

4. Optimize the prime factorization:
   - Modify the `primefactor()` function as follows:
     - Remove the `pr` vector and replace it with a `std::set<int>` to store prime numbers.
     - Replace the `sieve` vector with a `std::bitset<NUM+1>` to store boolean values for prime numbers.
     - Modify the loop in the `primefactor()` function to calculate the lowest prime factor for each number up to `N` using the sieve array.
     - Instead of iterating over all primes less than or equal to `lp[i]`, directly calculate the prime factors by dividing `i` by `lp[i]` until it becomes 1.

5. Use more efficient data structures:
   - Replace the `pr` vector with a `std::set<int>` to store prime numbers.
   - Replace the `sieve` vector with a `std::bitset<NUM+1>` to store boolean values for prime numbers.

6. Optimize the loop iterations:
   - In the first loop of the `test()` function, change the loop condition to `i <= n-2` instead of `i < n-1`.
   - In the second loop of the `test()` function, change the loop condition to `i <= n-1` instead of `i <= n`.

7. Use more efficient arithmetic operations:
   - Replace the `binpow()` function with an optimized version that uses bitwise operations to perform exponentiation in logarithmic time.
   - Use the modulus operator `%` to reduce the result in each step of the `binpow()` function.

8. Optimize I/O operations:
   - Replace `std::endl` with `'\n'` for line breaks in the `cout` statements.
