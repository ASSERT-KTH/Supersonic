Code Analysis:

1. The code includes unnecessary header files like `<bits/stdc++.h>` which is not considered good practice. It is better to include only the necessary header files.

2. The code uses macros to define common operations like `pb`, `ppb`, `mp`, etc. This can make the code less readable and harder to understand. It is better to avoid using macros and use explicit function calls and variable declarations instead.

3. The code uses a global variable `pr` to store prime numbers. Global variables can make the code harder to understand and maintain. It is better to encapsulate such variables within a function or a class.

4. The code uses a vector `edges` to store pairs of nodes and their weights. This vector is populated in a loop, which can be inefficient for large values of `n` and `m`. It is better to pre-allocate the required size of the vector using `reserve` function.

5. The code uses unnecessary loops and conditional statements to check for certain conditions. These can be simplified or optimized to improve performance.

6. The code uses `cout` statements inside a loop to print the elements of the `edges` vector. This can slow down the execution time significantly, especially for large values of `n` and `m`. It is better to use a stringstream or an intermediate vector to store the output and then print it once.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Remove unnecessary header files and macros to improve readability.

2. Encapsulate the `pr` vector inside the `primefactor` function to avoid using a global variable.

3. Use `reserve` function to pre-allocate the required size of the `edges` vector.

4. Simplify the logic for populating the `edges` vector to avoid unnecessary loops and conditional statements.

5. Use a stringstream or an intermediate vector to store the output and then print it once.

Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. Remove unnecessary header files and macros:

   - Remove the line `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`.
   - Replace the macro `pb` with the explicit function `push_back`.
   - Replace the macro `ppb` with the explicit function `pop_back`.
   - Replace the macro `mp` with the explicit function `make_pair`.

2. Encapsulate the `pr` vector inside the `primefactor` function:

   - Move the declaration and initialization of the `pr` vector inside the `primefactor` function.
   - Remove the global declaration of `pr`.

3. Use `reserve` function to pre-allocate the required size of the `edges` vector:

   - Before populating the `edges` vector, add the line `edges.reserve(n - 1 + m)` to pre-allocate the required size.

4. Simplify the logic for populating the `edges` vector:

   - Instead of using separate loops for `edges.pb(mp(mp(1, i), 1))` and `edges.pb(mp(mp(i, j), max(total_sum - sum, 2ll) + 1))`, combine them into a single loop.
   - Initialize `sum` to `n - 1` instead of `2` to avoid unnecessary computation.
   - Replace the nested loops with a single loop that iterates from `2` to `n` and `j` from `i + 1` to `n`.
   - Inside the loop, calculate the weight as `max(total_sum - sum, 2ll) + 1` and add the pair `(mp(i, j), weight)` to the `edges` vector.
   - Decrement `m` after adding each pair to `edges` to avoid unnecessary iterations.

5. Use a stringstream or an intermediate vector to store the output and then print it once:

   - Replace the `cout` statements inside the loop with `stringstream` or an intermediate vector to store the output.
   - After populating the `edges` vector, iterate over it and append each element to the `stringstream` or the intermediate vector.
   - Finally, print the contents of the `stringstream` or the intermediate vector.

Optimized Code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <sstream>
using namespace std;

#define int long long

void primefactor(vector<int>& pr) {
    const int N = 1000000;
    vector<int> lp(N + 1, 0);
    for (int i = 2; i <= N; ++i) {
        if (lp[i] == 0) {
            lp[i] = i;
            pr.push_back(i);
        }
        for (int j = 0; j < (int)pr.size() && pr[j] <= lp[i] && i * pr[j] <= N; ++j)
            lp[i * pr[j]] = pr[j];
    }
}

void test() {
    int n, m;
    cin >> n >> m;

    if (n == 2) {
        cout << 2 << " " << 2 << endl;
        cout << 1 << " " << 2 << " " << 2 << endl;
        return;
    }

    vector<int> pr;
    primefactor(pr);

    int total_sum = *lower_bound(pr.begin(), pr.end(), n);
    cout << 2 << " " << total_sum << endl;

    vector<pair<pair<int, int>, int>> edges;
    edges.reserve(n - 1 + m);

    edges.push_back(make_pair(make_pair(1, n), 2));
    int sum = n - 1;

    for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
        if (m == 0)
            break;
        for (int j = i + 1; j <= n; j++) {
            if (m == 0)
                break;
            int weight = max(total_sum - sum, 2ll) + 1;
            edges.push_back(make_pair(make_pair(i, j), weight));
            m--;
        }
    }

    stringstream output;

    for (int i = 0; i < edges.size(); i++) {
        output << edges[i].first.first << " " << edges[i].first.second << " " << edges[i].second << "\n";
    }

    cout << output.str();
}

signed main() {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(0);

    int t = 1;
    while (t--)
        test();

    return 0;
}
```

This optimized code removes unnecessary header files and macros, encapsulates the `pr` vector, pre-allocates the required size of the `edges` vector, simplifies the logic for populating the `edges` vector, and uses a stringstream to store the output and print it once. These optimizations improve the performance and reduce unnecessary computations.
