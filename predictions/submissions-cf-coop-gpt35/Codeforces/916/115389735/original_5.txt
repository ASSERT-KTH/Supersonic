Code Analysis:
- The code defines several functions for various mathematical operations such as prime factorization, exponentiation, gcd, lcm, etc.
- The `calc_sieve` function calculates a sieve array to find prime numbers.
- The `test` function takes input values `n` and `m`, and then generates a set of edges for a graph based on these values. The edges are then printed as output.
- The main function calls the `primefactor` function, initializes the value of `t`, and then repeatedly calls the `test` function.
- The code uses several preprocessor directives and typedefs to simplify the code and define common data types.

Potential Optimizations:
1. Avoid using the `using namespace std;` directive to minimize namespace pollution.
2. Avoid including the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header file, as it includes a large number of other header files and can slow down compilation.
3. Remove unnecessary functions and headers that are not used in the code.
4. Optimize the `primefactor` function by using a more efficient algorithm for prime factorization.
5. Optimize the calculation of the `sieve` array in the `calc_sieve` function by using a more efficient algorithm.
6. Optimize the `test` function by reducing unnecessary computations and memory usage.
7. Consider using more efficient data structures, such as arrays instead of vectors, where appropriate.
8. Apply compiler optimizations, such as loop unrolling or pragma directives, to further improve performance.

Optimization Steps:
1. Remove the unnecessary headers and functions that are not used in the code.
2. Replace the `primefactor` function with an optimized version that uses a more efficient algorithm for prime factorization. The optimized function is as follows:

```cpp
void primefactor() {
  lp.resize(N + 1, 0);
  for (int i = 2; i <= N; ++i) {
    if (lp[i] == 0) {
      pr.push_back(i);
      lp[i] = i;
    }
    for (int j = 0; j < (int)pr.size() && pr[j] <= lp[i] && i * pr[j] <= N; ++j) {
      lp[i * pr[j]] = pr[j];
    }
  }
}
```

3. Replace the `calc_sieve` function with an optimized version that uses a more efficient algorithm for calculating the sieve array. The optimized function is as follows:

```cpp
void calc_sieve() {
  sieve.resize(NUM + 1, 0);
  for (int x = 2; x <= NUM; x++) {
    if (sieve[x] == 0) {
      pr.push_back(x);
      for (int u = x; u <= NUM; u += x) {
        sieve[u] = x;
      }
    }
  }
}
```

4. Optimize the `test` function:
   - Remove the unnecessary check for `n == 2` at the beginning of the function, as it is already handled in the loop.
   - Replace the use of the `vector<pair<pi, int>>` data structure with a more memory-efficient alternative, such as a fixed-size array or a custom data structure.
   - Use a more efficient loop structure to generate the edges, avoiding unnecessary checks and updates.
   - Remove the unnecessary check for `m == 0` inside the inner loop, as it is already handled in the outer loop.
   - Use a more efficient method to print the edges, such as using a single `cout` statement instead of multiple calls.
   - Update the loop variables to use `size_t` data type instead of `int` where appropriate.
   - Remove the unnecessary `endl` in the `cout` statements and replace it with `"\n"`.
   - Use `reserve` to allocate memory for the edges vector to avoid unnecessary reallocations.

The optimized code is as follows:
