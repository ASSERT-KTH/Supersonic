Upon analyzing the code, I have identified several areas that can be optimized to improve performance and reduce memory usage:

1. `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`: This line includes a large number of standard library headers, which can lead to increased compilation time and unnecessary memory usage. It is better to include only the necessary headers explicitly.

2. `vector<int> lp, sieve;`: These vectors are used for prime factorization and sieve calculations. However, their sizes are predefined and larger than necessary. We can reduce their sizes to the maximum required size to save memory.

3. `vector<int> pr;`: This vector stores prime numbers. Since we are already calculating prime factors and the sieve, we can populate this vector using the calculated values instead of storing all prime numbers up to N.

4. `int total_sum = *lower_bound(all(pr), n);`: This line uses the `lower_bound` function to find the first prime number greater than or equal to n. However, since `pr` is a vector of prime numbers, it is already sorted in ascending order. We can replace this line with a simple loop to find the first prime number greater than or equal to n.

5. `vector<pair<pi, int>> edges;`: This vector stores the edges of a graph. However, it is not necessary to store the edges themselves. We can directly print the edges as we generate them, eliminating the need for this vector and reducing memory usage.

6. `for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) { if (m == 0) break; for (int j = i + 1; j <= n; j++) { if (m == 0) break; edges.pb(mp(mp(i, j), max(total_sum - sum, 2ll) + 1)); m--; } }`: This nested loop generates all possible edges between vertices i and j. However, we can optimize this loop by using a single loop and calculating the corresponding vertex j based on the remaining number of edges.

7. `t = 1; while (t--) test();`: The test function is called only once, so there is no need for the while loop. We can directly call the test function.
