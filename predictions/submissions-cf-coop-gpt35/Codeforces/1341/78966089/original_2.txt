Upon analyzing the given code, here are some potential optimizations that can be made:

1. Avoid unnecessary includes: The line `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` includes all the standard library headers, which can bloat the compiled binary. Instead, only include the necessary headers, such as `<iostream>` and `<vector>`.

2. Avoid using `using namespace std`: While it can make the code more concise, it can also lead to naming conflicts and make the code less readable. Instead, use the `std::` prefix to explicitly indicate the usage of standard library functions and types.

3. Use more appropriate data types: The code currently uses `long long` (`ll`) for variables `t`, `j`, `k`, and `n`. However, since these values are used for indexing and iteration, it would be more appropriate to use `int` instead.

4. Preallocate memory for the vector: The vector `v` is currently resized dynamically, which can lead to multiple reallocations and copying of elements. Since the size of the vector `v` is known in advance, we can allocate the necessary memory upfront using the `reserve()` function.

5. Use prefix increment in loops: The loop variable `f` in the loop `for (ll f = 1; f < v.size() - 1; f++)` can be incremented using the prefix increment operator (`++f`) instead of the postfix increment operator (`f++`). This can be slightly more efficient as it avoids creating a temporary copy of the variable.

6. Use a prefix sum array instead of vector `t`: The vector `t` is used to store the values of 1 at the indices where the condition `(v[f] > v[f - 1]) && (v[f] > v[f + 1])` is true. Instead of using a separate vector, we can use a prefix sum array to store the cumulative sum of these values. This will eliminate the need for vector `t` and the subsequent loop to calculate the prefix sum.

7. Avoid unnecessary updates to `v`: The loop `for (ll o = 0; o < v.size(); o++)` updates the values of `v` using the prefix sum stored in `sum`. However, this is unnecessary as the updated values of `v` are not used further in the code. We can remove this loop to optimize the code.

8. Optimize the loop for finding the maximum subarray sum: The loop `for (ll l = 0; l <= v.size() - k + 1; l++)` can be optimized by keeping track of the current maximum sum and its corresponding left index (`ans` and `left`). Instead of iterating over the entire subarray for each position, we can update the maximum sum and left index whenever a larger sum is found.

Taking all these optimizations into consideration, here's the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

int main() {
  int t;
  std::cin >> t;

  while (t--) {
    int n, k;
    std::cin >> n >> k;

    std::vector<int> v;
    v.reserve(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      int j;
      std::cin >> j;
      v.push_back(j);
    }

    std::vector<int> prefixSum(n, 0);
    for (int f = 1; f < n - 1; f++) {
      if (v[f] > v[f - 1] && v[f] > v[f + 1]) {
        prefixSum[f] = 1;
      }
    }

    for (int f = 1; f < n; f++) {
      prefixSum[f] += prefixSum[f - 1];
    }

    int ans = 0;
    int left = 1;
    for (int l = 0; l <= n - k; l++) {
      int sum = prefixSum[l + k - 2] - prefixSum[l];
      if (sum > ans) {
        ans = sum;
        left = l + 1;
      }
    }

    std::cout << ans + 1 << " " << left << "\n";
  }

  return 0;
}
```

These optimizations improve the performance of the code by eliminating unnecessary operations and reducing memory usage. The code complexity remains the same, and the functionality and output of the original code are preserved.
