Analysis:
- The code reads an integer `t` from input, which represents the number of test cases.
- For each test case, it reads integers `n` and `k`, followed by `n` integers representing elements of an array.
- It then iterates over the array to determine if each element is a peak (larger than its adjacent elements) and stores the result in another array `t`.
- Next, it calculates the prefix sum of the `t` array and stores it in the original array `v`.
- Finally, it finds the maximum subarray sum of `k` consecutive elements in `v` and outputs the maximum sum and its starting position.

Potential optimizations:
1. Avoid using `bits/stdc++.h`: The code includes the entire `bits/stdc++.h` library, which is not necessary and can increase compilation time. It is better to only include the required headers.
2. Remove unnecessary `typedef` and `using` statements: The `typedef long long ll` and `using namespace std` statements are not used in the code and can be removed.
3. Avoid using `vector` for temporary storage: The code uses a `vector` to store the input elements temporarily before copying them to the `v` array. This is unnecessary and can be avoided by directly storing the elements in the `v` array.
4. Optimize the peak finding loop: The loop that determines if each element is a peak can be optimized by avoiding unnecessary checks. Currently, it checks if each element is greater than its adjacent elements, but it does not handle the edge cases properly (first and last elements). By modifying the loop condition and adding appropriate checks, we can optimize this loop.
5. Optimize the prefix sum calculation: The loop that calculates the prefix sum can be optimized by avoiding the use of an additional array `t`. Instead, we can directly update the elements of `v` with the prefix sum.
6. Optimize the maximum subarray sum calculation: The loop that finds the maximum subarray sum can be optimized by avoiding unnecessary calculations. Currently, it calculates the sum of `k` consecutive elements for each possible subarray, which results in redundant computations. We can optimize this by using a sliding window approach and updating the sum in constant time.

Optimization steps:
1. Remove unnecessary `typedef` and `using` statements.
2. Replace `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` with the necessary headers.
3. Replace the usage of `vector<ll> v` with a fixed-size array `ll v[MAX_SIZE]`.
4. Modify the peak finding loop to handle edge cases and avoid unnecessary checks.
    - Change the loop condition to `for (ll f = 1; f < v.size() - 1; f++)`.
    - Replace the if condition with:
      ```
      if ((v[f] > v[f - 1]) && (v[f] > v[f + 1]))
        t[f] = 1;
      ```
      to handle edge cases.
5. Optimize the prefix sum calculation by updating the elements of `v` directly.
    - Replace the loop with:
      ```
      for (ll o = 1; o < n; o++) {
        v[o] = v[o] + v[o - 1];
      }
      ```
6. Optimize the maximum subarray sum calculation using a sliding window approach.
    - Initialize `sum` as the sum of the first `k` elements of `v`.
    - Iterate over the remaining elements of `v` using a loop.
    - Update `sum` by subtracting the element `v[l - 1]` and adding the element `v[l + k - 1]` at each iteration.
    - Update `ans` and `left` if `sum` is greater than the current maximum sum.
7. Update the output statement to print the maximum sum and its starting position.

Optimized code:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

const int MAX_SIZE = 10^5;

int main() {
  int t;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    int n, k;
    cin >> n >> k;
    int v[MAX_SIZE];
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      cin >> v[i];
    }
    vector<int> t(n, 0);
    for (int f = 1; f < n - 1; f++) {
      if ((v[f] > v[f - 1]) && (v[f] > v[f + 1]))
        t[f] = 1;
    }
    for (int o = 1; o < n; o++) {
      v[o] = v[o] + v[o - 1];
    }
    int ans = v[k - 1];
    int left = 1;
    for (int l = 1; l <= n - k; l++) {
      int sum = v[l + k - 1] - v[l - 1];
      if (sum > ans) {
        ans = sum;
        left = l + 1;
      }
    }
    cout << ans + 1 << " " << left << "\n";
  }
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized code should provide improved performance by avoiding unnecessary operations and optimizing the critical sections of the code.
