The provided code calculates the number of local maximums in a given array, and then finds the maximum subarray sum of length k. The code uses a vector to store the array elements and another vector to store the number of local maximums. 

However, there are several areas where the code can be optimized:

1. Avoid using the `vector` data structure: The `vector` data structure is not the most memory-efficient choice in this case since it dynamically resizes itself, resulting in unnecessary memory allocations and deallocations. Instead, we can use a fixed-size array to store the array elements.

2. Avoid using the `vector` for storing the number of local maximums: Instead of using a `vector` to store the number of local maximums, we can use a single variable to keep track of the count. This will reduce memory usage and improve performance.

3. Simplify the loop conditions: The loop conditions in the code can be simplified to avoid unnecessary checks. For example, the loop condition `for (ll f = 1; f < v.size() - 1; f++)` can be changed to `for (ll f = 1; f < v.size() - 1; f++)`. This will avoid unnecessary checks at the beginning and end of the loop.

4. Optimize the calculation of the maximum subarray sum: The calculation of the maximum subarray sum can be optimized by reducing the number of operations. Currently, the code iterates over the array and calculates the sum for each subarray of length k. This can be improved by using a sliding window technique to calculate the sum of the first subarray of length k, and then updating the sum by subtracting the element at the left end of the subarray and adding the element at the right end of the subarray.

5. Avoid unnecessary variable assignments: The variable `left` is assigned `l + 1` inside the loop, even if the condition `ans < v[l + k - 2] - v[l]` is not satisfied. We can move this assignment outside the loop to avoid unnecessary assignments.

Taking these optimization strategies into consideration, here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

typedef long long ll;

int main() {
    ll t;
    cin >> t;
    while (t--) {
        ll n, k;
        cin >> n >> k;

        ll v[100000];
        for (ll i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            cin >> v[i];
        }

        ll numLocalMax = 0;
        for (ll i = 1; i < n - 1; i++) {
            if (v[i] > v[i - 1] && v[i] > v[i + 1]) {
                numLocalMax++;
            }
        }

        ll sum = 0;
        for (ll i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            sum += numLocalMax;
            numLocalMax -= (i >= k - 2 && v[i - k + 2] > v[i - k + 1] && v[i - k + 2] > v[i - k + 3]);
            v[i] = sum;
        }

        ll ans = 0, left = 1;
        for (ll i = 0; i <= n - k + 1; i++) {
            ll subarraySum = v[i + k - 2] - (i > 0 ? v[i - 1] : 0);
            if (subarraySum > ans) {
                ans = subarraySum;
                left = i + 1;
            }
        }

        cout << ans + 1 << " " << left << "\n";
    }

    return 0;
}
```

This optimized code simplifies the data structures used and reduces unnecessary calculations. It also eliminates the need for the `vector` data structure, which improves memory usage and runtime performance.
