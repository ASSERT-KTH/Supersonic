Upon analyzing the given code, here are some potential areas for optimization:

1. Unnecessary includes: The code includes `<bits/stdc++.h>`, which is not a standard header file and can result in slower compilation times. It is recommended to include only the necessary standard library headers.

2. Excessive template functions: The code includes multiple template functions (`to_string()`, `write()`, `print()`, `DBG()`) that are not used in the given code. These functions can be removed to reduce unnecessary function calls and improve code readability.

3. Redundant data structure: The `array<int, 3>` type alias is defined but not used. This can be removed to avoid unnecessary memory usage.

4. Unoptimized sorting: The code uses the `sort()` function to sort the vector `b`. However, the sorting can be optimized by using a counting sort algorithm since the range of values in `b` is known in advance.

5. Inefficient data structure: The code uses a segment tree (`st`) to perform range queries and updates. However, the segment tree is implemented in an inefficient manner, resulting in slower query and update operations.

6. Suboptimal loop structure: The code uses nested loops to iterate over the vector `b` and perform certain operations. This can be optimized by using a single loop and maintaining a separate count for each unique element in `b`.

Based on these observations, here is an optimization strategy:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: Remove the `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` line and include only the necessary standard library headers.

2. Remove unused template functions: Remove the unused template functions (`to_string()`, `write()`, `print()`, `DBG()`).

3. Remove unused data structure: Remove the unused `array<int, 3>` type alias.

4. Optimize the sorting: Replace the `sort()` function with a counting sort algorithm to sort the vector `b` efficiently.

5. Optimize the segment tree implementation: Rewrite the segment tree implementation to use a more efficient data structure, such as an implicit segment tree or a Fenwick tree.

6. Optimize the loop structure: Replace the nested loops with a single loop to iterate over the vector `b` and perform the required operations.

Now, let's proceed with the step-by-step explanation of each optimization step and provide the optimized code.
