This code appears to be implementing a solution to a problem. However, there are several areas of the code that can be optimized for better performance. 

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The code includes the `bits/stdc++.h` header, which includes a large number of standard library headers. This can slow down compilation time and increase memory usage. It is recommended to include only the necessary standard library headers.

2. Avoid using macros: The code uses macros extensively, such as `fast`, `int`, `pint`, `INF`, `sz`, etc. Macros can make the code harder to read and understand, and they can also lead to unexpected behavior. It is recommended to replace macros with const variables or inline functions.

3. Optimize string conversion functions: The code includes multiple string conversion functions, such as `to_string(bool)`, `to_string(const char*)`, `to_string(string)`, etc. These functions are not used in the provided code and can be removed to reduce unnecessary code bloat.

4. Replace array with vector: The code uses a fixed-size array `int arr[n1]`, which can cause memory wastage if `n1` is larger than the allocated size. It is recommended to use a `vector` instead, which can dynamically resize itself based on the number of elements.

5. Avoid unnecessary function calls: The code performs repeated function calls to `build()` and `upd()` for the same indices. These function calls can be avoided by updating the necessary values directly.

6. Optimize sorting algorithm: The code uses the `sort()` function to sort the `b` vector. The current implementation uses the default comparison function, which can be inefficient for large datasets. It is recommended to use a custom comparison function or a more efficient sorting algorithm, such as `std::sort()`.

7. Minimize memory usage: The code defines a large array `int ans[n1]` to store the results. This array can be replaced with a `vector` to minimize memory usage.

8. Use more efficient data structures: The code uses an array `st` to implement a segment tree. However, the current implementation uses a fixed-size array and a struct, which can be inefficient for large datasets. It is recommended to use a `vector` or a more efficient data structure, such as an array of pairs or a custom data structure.

9. Optimize loop iteration: The code uses a `for` loop to iterate over the `b` vector. However, the loop condition is checked twice in each iteration (`while` loop and `for` loop). It is recommended to optimize the loop iteration by combining the two loops into one.

10. Use more efficient loop variables: The code uses `int i` as the loop variable in multiple loops. It is recommended to use a more descriptive variable name to improve code readability.
