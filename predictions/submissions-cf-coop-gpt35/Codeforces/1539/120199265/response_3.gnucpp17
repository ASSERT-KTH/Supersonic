After analyzing the given code, we can identify several areas where optimization can be applied:

1. Unnecessary includes: The code includes the entire `<bits/stdc++.h>` header, which is not necessary and can slow down the compilation process. We can replace this with specific headers that are actually needed.

2. Excessive template specialization: The code includes a large number of template specialization functions for different types. This can result in code bloat and can negatively impact compilation time. We can remove these unnecessary template specializations.

3. Redundant string conversion functions: The code includes several `to_string` functions that are not used in the given code. We can remove these unused functions to reduce code complexity and improve compilation time.

4. Inefficient data structures: The code uses an array of structures (`st`) to represent a segment tree. This can result in inefficient memory usage, especially when the tree size is large. We can optimize this data structure to reduce memory usage.

5. Inefficient sorting: The code uses the `sort` function to sort the `b` vector. We can use a more efficient sorting algorithm, such as `std::stable_sort`, which has a lower time complexity for partially sorted sequences.

6. Unnecessary rebuilding of the segment tree: The code rebuilds the segment tree multiple times unnecessarily. This can be avoided by modifying the `upd` function to update the tree lazily.

7. Inefficient query functions: The `qry1` and `qry2` functions use recursion to query the segment tree. We can optimize these functions by using a loop instead of recursion.

8. Redundant build calls: The code calls the `build` function multiple times unnecessarily. We can remove these redundant calls to improve performance.

Based on these observations, we can propose the following optimization strategy:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: Replace the `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` with specific headers that are actually needed in the code.

2. Remove unnecessary template specializations: Remove the unused template specialization functions to reduce code bloat and improve compilation time.

3. Remove redundant string conversion functions: Remove the unused `to_string` functions to reduce code complexity and improve compilation time.

4. Optimize the segment tree data structure: Replace the array of structures (`st`) with a more memory-efficient data structure, such as a single array for storing the tree nodes.

5. Use stable_sort instead of sort: Replace the `sort` function with `std::stable_sort` for sorting the `b` vector to improve performance.

6. Update the segment tree lazily: Modify the `upd` function to update the tree lazily, avoiding unnecessary rebuilding of the tree.

7. Optimize query functions: Replace the recursive calls in the `qry1` and `qry2` functions with a loop to improve performance.

8. Remove redundant build calls: Remove the redundant `build` function calls to improve performance.
