Code Analysis:
1. The code includes unnecessary header files and defines that are not used in the program.
2. The code uses a custom template for converting different data types to strings, which is not required for the given program.
3. The code uses a custom debugging function that prints debug information to the cerr stream, which is not required for the optimization task.
4. The code uses a custom array structure "node" to store information about each node in a segment tree.
5. The code uses a segment tree implementation to perform range updates and range queries on an array.
6. The code sorts the given array and uses the segment tree to calculate the answer for each element in the sorted array.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Remove unnecessary header files and defines to reduce compilation time and memory usage.
2. Remove unused custom template functions and debugging functions to simplify the code.
3. Replace the custom "node" structure with a simple pair of integers to represent the maximum and minimum values in a segment.
4. Optimize the segment tree implementation by reducing memory usage and eliminating unnecessary operations.
5. Optimize the sorting algorithm by using a counting sort instead of the default sort function.
6. Combine the two loops that update the segment tree and calculate the answer into a single loop to reduce the number of operations.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Remove unnecessary header files and defines:
   - Remove the #include <bits/stdc++.h> line, as it includes unnecessary header files.
   - Remove the fast define, as it is not used in the program.
   - Remove the int long long int define, as it is not used in the program.
   - Remove the pint array define, as it is not used in the program.
   - Remove the INF define, as it is not used in the program.
   - Remove the sz define, as it is not used in the program.
   - Remove the to_string function definitions, as they are not used in the program.
   - Remove the write and print function definitions, as they are not used in the program.
   - Remove the deb and DBG function definitions, as they are not used in the program.
   - Remove the deb define, as it is not used in the program.

2. Remove unused custom template functions and debugging functions:
   - Remove the implementation of the to_string function for vector<bool>, as it is not used in the program.
   - Remove the implementation of the to_string function for bitset<S>, as it is not used in the program.
   - Remove the implementation of the to_string function for any type T, as it is not used in the program.
   - Remove the implementation of the write function, as it is not used in the program.
   - Remove the implementation of the print function, as it is not used in the program.
   - Remove the implementation of the DBG function, as it is not used in the program.
   - Remove the deb function, as it is not used in the program.

3. Replace the custom "node" structure:
   - Replace the struct node with a pair of integers (mx, mi) to represent the maximum and minimum values in a segment.

4. Optimize the segment tree implementation:
   - Remove the lz member from the node structure and use -MOD to represent uninitialized values.
   - Remove the push function, as it is not needed in the optimized implementation.
   - Remove the apply and push calls in the build function, as they are not needed in the optimized implementation.
   - Remove the apply and push calls in the upd function, as they are not needed in the optimized implementation.
   - Remove the apply and push calls in the qry1 and qry2 functions, as they are not needed in the optimized implementation.
   - Remove the build calls before the first loop and after the second loop, as they are not needed in the optimized implementation.

5. Optimize the sorting algorithm:
   - Replace the sort function call with a counting sort algorithm to sort the array based on the count of each element.

6. Combine the two loops that update the segment tree and calculate the answer:
   - Combine the two loops that iterate over the sorted array into a single loop.
   - Calculate the answer for each element in the sorted array and update the segment tree in the same loop.

        st[l1].second = 0;
    }
    st[l1].second += x;
