The provided code appears to be solving a problem related to range queries and updates on a segment tree. The main bottleneck in this code is the inefficiency in the segment tree operations, specifically the `build`, `upd`, `qry1`, and `qry2` functions. These functions are called multiple times in nested loops, resulting in a significant impact on the overall performance of the program.

To optimize this code, we can focus on the following areas:

1. Avoid unnecessary memory allocation: The code currently uses a fixed-size array `int arr[n1]` to store the input values. Since the size `n1` is known at runtime, it would be better to use a dynamically allocated array or a vector to avoid any potential memory overflow or waste.

2. Improve segment tree operations:
   - In the `build` function, the recursive calls can be optimized by passing the array `arr` as a reference, instead of creating a new array for each recursive call. This will eliminate unnecessary memory allocation and improve performance.
   - In the `upd`, `qry1`, and `qry2` functions, the `push` function is called to propagate the updates lazily. However, the current implementation of `push` uses recursion, which can be inefficient for large segment trees. Instead, we can use an iterative approach to propagate the updates, which will reduce function call overhead and improve performance.

3. Simplify and optimize the nested loops: The nested loops in the `solve` function can be simplified and optimized to reduce redundant computations. The current implementation performs multiple queries and updates on the segment tree for the same value, leading to unnecessary calculations. We can optimize this by grouping the queries and updates together and performing them in a single pass.

4. Use compiler optimizations: We can enable compiler optimizations, such as loop unrolling and function inlining, to further improve the performance of the code. This can be achieved by using compiler-specific optimization flags or pragmas.
