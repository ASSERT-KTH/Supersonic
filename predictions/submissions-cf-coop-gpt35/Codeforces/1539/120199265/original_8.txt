The given code is a C++ program that solves a specific problem. However, the code is not optimized for performance. Here are some potential optimization strategies for this program:

1. Avoid unnecessary includes: The code includes `<bits/stdc++.h>`, which is a non-standard header file that includes a large number of other headers. This can increase compilation time and may include unnecessary dependencies. It is better to include only the necessary headers explicitly.

2. Avoid unnecessary string conversion functions: The code includes multiple string conversion functions (`to_string`) that convert various types to string. However, these functions are not used in the code. Removing these unnecessary functions can improve the program's efficiency.

3. Use fixed-size arrays instead of vectors: The code uses a vector to store the input array (`arr`). Since the size of the array is known at compile-time, it is more efficient to use a fixed-size array instead of a vector.

4. Avoid unnecessary sorting: The code sorts the `b` vector using the `sort` function. However, the sorted vector is not used in the final result. Removing this unnecessary sorting step can improve the program's efficiency.

5. Optimize the build function: The `build` function is called multiple times, which can be optimized. Instead of rebuilding the entire segment tree each time, we can update only the necessary nodes. This can be achieved by keeping track of the range of each node and updating only the nodes that are affected by the current operation.

6. Optimize the push function: The `push` function updates the child nodes of the current node. However, it can be optimized by using lazy propagation. Instead of updating the child nodes immediately, we can store the updates in the current node and apply them later when needed.

7. Optimize the upd function: The `upd` function updates the range `[l1, r1]` with a given value `x`. However, it can be optimized by using lazy propagation. Instead of updating the entire range immediately, we can store the updates in the current node and apply them later when needed.

8. Optimize the qry1 and qry2 functions: The `qry1` and `qry2` functions return the maximum and minimum values in a given range. However, they can be optimized by using lazy propagation. Instead of querying the entire range immediately, we can store the updates in the current node and apply them later when needed.

9. Remove unnecessary loops and variables: The code includes several unnecessary loops and variables that do not contribute to the final result. Removing these unnecessary loops and variables can improve the program's efficiency.

10. Use compiler optimizations: You can enable compiler optimizations to improve the performance of the program. For example, you can use optimization flags like `-O3` to enable aggressive optimizations.

Now, let's apply these optimization strategies to the code:
