Upon analyzing the given code, we can identify several potential areas for optimization:

1. Redundant calculations in the `check` function: The `check` function performs repeated calculations for every iteration of the `while` loop in the `main` function. We can optimize this by moving some calculations outside the loop.

2. Unnecessary vector initialization: The vectors `x` and `y` are initialized with zeros, but these values are overwritten in the subsequent loop. We can avoid this unnecessary initialization.

3. Unoptimized binary search: The binary search in the `while` loop performs a linear search for the midpoint. We can optimize this by using the bitwise shift operator instead of division by 2.

4. Inefficient input/output: The code includes the `bits/stdc++.h` header, which is not recommended for optimization purposes. We can include specific headers instead. Additionally, using `cin` and `cout` for input/output can be slower compared to other methods like `scanf` and `printf`.

Based on these observations, we can propose the following optimization strategy:

1. Move the calculations of `full_periods`, `this_day`, `current_x`, and `current_y` outside the loop in the `check` function. These values are constant for every iteration of the loop and can be calculated once before the loop starts.

2. Remove the initialization of `x` and `y` vectors with zeros, as they are overwritten in the subsequent loop.

3. Replace the division by 2 in the binary search with a bitwise shift operation (`>> 1`) to optimize the midpoint calculation.

4. Replace `cin` and `cout` with `scanf` and `printf` for faster input/output.

Let's optimize the code step by step:
