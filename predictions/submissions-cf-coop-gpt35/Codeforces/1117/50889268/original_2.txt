Code Analysis:
1. The code reads input values for `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `n`, and `s`.
2. It then initializes two vectors `x` and `y` of size `n+1` with all elements set to 0.
3. The code then iterates through the string `s` and updates the `x` and `y` vectors based on the characters in `s`.
4. It uses binary search to find the smallest positive integer `r` such that `check(x, y, n, r)` returns true.
5. If `r` is greater than 1e17, it outputs -1; otherwise, it outputs `r`.

Potential optimizations:
1. The code uses a binary search to find the smallest positive integer `r` that satisfies the condition in `check` function. This is an efficient approach.
2. The code uses vectors to store the cumulative sums of `x` and `y`. These vectors can be optimized to use less memory.
3. The code uses an `abs` function call to calculate the absolute difference between `x2` and `current_x`, and between `y2` and `current_y`. This can be optimized by using subtraction and comparison operations directly.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Replace the use of vectors `x` and `y` with simple variables to store the cumulative sums.
2. Replace the `abs` function call with subtraction and comparison operations.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Replace the `vector<ll> x(n + 1, 0), y(n + 1, 0)` declaration with `ll current_x = 0, current_y = 0`.
   - This change eliminates the need for vectors and reduces memory usage.
2. Replace the loop that updates `x` and `y` with the following code:
   ```
   for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
     if (s[i] == 'U')
       current_y++;
     if (s[i] == 'D')
       current_y--;
     if (s[i] == 'L')
       current_x--;
     if (s[i] == 'R')
       current_x++;
   }
   ```
   - This change eliminates the need for cumulative sum vectors and simplifies the code.
3. Replace the `abs(x2 - current_x) + abs(y2 - current_y) <= pos` condition in the `check` function with the following code:
   ```
   if ((x2 - current_x) * (x2 - current_x) + (y2 - current_y) * (y2 - current_y) <= pos * pos)
     return true;
   else
     return false;
   ```
   - This change avoids the `abs` function call and uses direct subtraction, multiplication, and comparison operations.
4. Replace the `cout << r;` and `cout << -1;` statements in the main function with the following code:
   ```
   if (r > 1e17) {
     cout << -1 << endl;
   } else {
     cout << r << endl;
   }
   ```
   - This change adds a newline character at the end of the output.

Optimized Code Block:
```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
#define ll long long
using namespace std;
ll x1, y1, x2, y2;
bool check(ll current_x, ll current_y, int n, ll pos) {
  return (x2 - current_x) * (x2 - current_x) + (y2 - current_y) * (y2 - current_y) <= pos * pos;
}
int main() {
  int n;
  string s;
  cin >> x1 >> y1 >> x2 >> y2;
  cin >> n >> s;
  ll current_x = 0, current_y = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    if (s[i] == 'U')
      current_y++;
    if (s[i] == 'D')
      current_y--;
    if (s[i] == 'L')
      current_x--;
    if (s[i] == 'R')
      current_x++;
  }
  ll l = 0, r = 1e18;
  while (r - l > 1) {
    ll mid = (l + r) / 2;
    if (check(current_x, current_y, n, mid)) {
      r = mid;
    } else {
      l = mid;
    }
  }
  if (r > 1e17) {
    cout << -1 << endl;
  } else {
    cout << r << endl;
  }
}
