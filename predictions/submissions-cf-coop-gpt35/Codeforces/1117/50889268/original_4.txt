Code Analysis:
- The code calculates the minimum number of days required to reach the point (x2, y2) starting from the point (x1, y1), based on a given string of directions.
- It uses binary search to find the minimum number of days.
- The function `check` checks if it is possible to reach the destination within a given number of days.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Avoid unnecessary memory allocations:
   - The vectors `x` and `y` are used to store the cumulative sums of x and y coordinates. However, these vectors can be replaced with variables since the cumulative sums are only used within the loop and not outside it.

2. Avoid repeated calculations:
   - The variables `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are used repeatedly in the `check` function. Instead of accessing them multiple times, we can assign them to local variables within the function to avoid repeated calculations.

3. Optimize the binary search:
   - The binary search is currently implemented using a while loop. We can optimize it further by using a more efficient termination condition. Instead of `r - l > 1`, we can use `r > l + 1` to achieve the same result.

4. Use more appropriate data types:
   - The vectors `x` and `y` are of type `vector<ll>`, where `ll` is a long long. However, using long long for these vectors is unnecessary since the coordinates are integers. We can use the int data type instead.

Optimized Code Block:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

bool check(int x1, int y1, int x2, int y2, const string& s, int n, int pos) {
  int full_periods = pos / n;
  int this_day = pos % n;
  int current_x = x1 + full_periods * x[n] + x[this_day];
  int current_y = y1 + full_periods * y[n] + y[this_day];
  return abs(x2 - current_x) + abs(y2 - current_y) <= pos;
}

int main() {
  int x1, y1, x2, y2;
  int n;
  string s;
  cin >> x1 >> y1 >> x2 >> y2;
  cin >> n >> s;

  int x = 0, y = 0;
  int l = 0, r = 1e9;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    if (s[i] == 'U')
      y++;
    if (s[i] == 'D')
      y--;
    if (s[i] == 'L')
      x--;
    if (s[i] == 'R')
      x++;
    if (i + 1 <= r) {
      int current_x = x1 + x;
      int current_y = y1 + y;
      if (abs(x2 - current_x) + abs(y2 - current_y) <= i + 1) {
        r = i + 1;
      }
    }
  }

  while (r > l + 1) {
    int mid = (l + r) / 2;
    if (check(x1, y1, x2, y2, s, n, mid)) {
      r = mid;
    } else {
      l = mid;
    }
  }

  if (r > 1e9) {
    cout << -1;
  } else {
    cout << r;
  }

  return 0;
}
```

Explanation:
- Replaced the vectors `x` and `y` with variables `x` and `y` since the cumulative sums are only used within the loop and not outside it.
- Replaced the long long data type with the int data type for `x` and `y` since the coordinates are integers.
- Assigned the variables `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` to local variables within the `check` function to avoid repeated calculations.
- Optimized the termination condition of the binary search to `r > l + 1`.
- Removed the unnecessary condition `if (r - l > 1)` from the binary search loop.
- Added an early termination condition within the loop to check if the current position is within the range of `r`.
