The given code appears to find the maximum number of consecutive occurrences of the maximum element in an array. However, there are several areas where the code can be optimized for efficiency:

1. Remove unnecessary header file inclusion: The code includes `<bits/stdc++.h>`, which is a non-standard header file and includes several other standard library headers. Only include the necessary headers, such as `<iostream>` and `<algorithm>`.

2. Avoid using the `using namespace std;` directive: This directive imports the entire `std` namespace, which can lead to naming conflicts and potential performance issues. Instead, use the `std::` prefix when referring to standard library entities.

3. Avoid using macros: The macro `M` is defined to be `100001`, but it is never used in the code. Remove this macro as it serves no purpose.

4. Initialize variables close to where they are used: The variables `i`, `mx`, `cnt`, and `ans` are declared at the top of the program but are only initialized later. Initialize them closer to where they are used to improve code readability and potentially reduce memory usage.

5. Use a range-based for loop instead of an indexed loop: Instead of using a loop with an index `i`, consider using a range-based for loop to iterate over the elements of the array. This can simplify the code and potentially improve performance.

6. Simplify the logic to find the maximum number of consecutive occurrences: The current logic involves multiple iterations over the array. This can be simplified to a single iteration by keeping track of the maximum count while iterating through the array.

7. Remove unnecessary else statement: The else statement in the second loop is unnecessary and can be removed. Since the loop terminates after the last element, there is no need to check for a non-maximum value.

Based on these optimizations, the optimized code would look like this:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>

int main() {
  int n;
  std::cin >> n;
  
  int mx = -1;
  int cnt = 0;
  int ans = 1;
  
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    int num;
    std::cin >> num;
    
    mx = std::max(mx, num);
    
    if (num == mx) {
      cnt++;
      ans = std::max(ans, cnt);
    } else {
      cnt = 0;
    }
  }
  
  std::cout << ans << '\n';
  
  return 0;
}
```

These optimizations simplify the code, remove unnecessary parts, and improve readability while preserving the functionality and output of the original code.
