The provided code is a simple program that reads an array of integers and finds the length of the longest subarray that contains the maximum element of the array. However, there are several opportunities for optimization in this code.

1. Avoid unnecessary includes:
   - The `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` includes a large number of standard library headers, which can slow down the compilation process and increase memory usage. It is better to include only the necessary headers, such as `<iostream>` for input/output operations.

2. Avoid using global variables:
   - The variables `arr`, `n`, `i`, `mx`, `cnt`, and `ans` are declared as global variables. Global variables can make the code harder to understand and maintain. It is better to declare variables closer to their usage scope, such as inside the `main()` function.

3. Use more descriptive variable names:
   - The variable names `arr`, `n`, `i`, `mx`, `cnt`, and `ans` are not very descriptive. Using more meaningful variable names can improve code readability and maintainability.

4. Optimize the loop:
   - The two loops used in the code can be combined to avoid iterating over the array twice. By doing this, we can find the maximum element and the length of the longest subarray in a single loop, improving efficiency.

5. Optimize the comparison and assignment operations:
   - The comparison `arr[i] > mx` is performed in each iteration of the loop. By using a temporary variable, we can avoid this comparison and assignment operation in each iteration, resulting in a slight performance improvement.

6. Use a more efficient algorithm:
   - The current algorithm has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the size of the array. By using a more efficient algorithm, we can reduce the time complexity to O(1) or O(log n).

Based on these observations, let's optimize the code step by step.
