The given code reads an integer `n` from the input, followed by `n` integers. It then finds the maximum element `mx` in the array `arr`, and counts the number of times `mx` appears consecutively in the array. The output is the maximum count.

Let's analyze the code for potential optimization:

1. The code includes the header `<bits/stdc++.h>`, which is not a standard header and is not recommended. It is better to include the necessary standard headers explicitly.

2. The `using namespace std;` directive is used, which can lead to naming conflicts and make the code less readable. It is better to avoid this directive and use the `std::` prefix for standard library entities.

3. The array `arr` has a fixed size of `M`, which is quite large. If the input `n` is smaller than `M`, there will be unused memory, and if `n` is larger than `M`, the code will have undefined behavior. It is better to dynamically allocate memory based on the input `n`.

4. The loop to find the maximum element can be optimized. Instead of checking if each element is greater than `mx` and updating `mx` if true, we can use the `std::max` function to find the maximum element in the array.

5. The loop to count consecutive occurrences of the maximum element can be optimized. Currently, it checks if each element is equal to `mx` and updates the count accordingly. Instead, we can keep track of the current count and update the maximum count whenever a different element is encountered.

Based on this analysis, let's proceed with the optimization strategy:

1. Replace the non-standard header include with the necessary standard headers.

2. Remove the `using namespace std;` directive and use the `std::` prefix for standard library entities.

3. Replace the fixed-size array `arr[M]` with dynamic memory allocation based on the input `n`.

4. Use the `std::max_element` function to find the maximum element in the array.

5. Optimize the loop to count consecutive occurrences of the maximum element by keeping track of the current count and updating the maximum count whenever a different element is encountered.
