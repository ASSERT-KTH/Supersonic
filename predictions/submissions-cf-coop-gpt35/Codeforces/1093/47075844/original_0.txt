The given code seems to implement a graph algorithm that finds the number of valid colorings for a given graph. The code uses a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to traverse the graph and assign colors to the vertices. The main bottleneck in the code appears to be the BFS function, which has a time complexity of O(V + E), where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges.

To optimize the code, we can focus on the following areas:

1. Avoid using the `std::vector<bool>` data structure:
   The code currently uses `std::vector<bool>` to keep track of visited vertices. However, this data structure is not efficient in terms of memory usage and can result in slower performance due to its implementation as a bit-packed container. Instead, we can use a regular `std::vector<int>` or `std::vector<bool>` with integer values (0 for unvisited, 1 for visited) to achieve better performance.

2. Remove unnecessary memory allocations:
   The code currently creates a new `std::vector<string>` for every call to the `split` function. This can result in unnecessary memory allocations and deallocations. We can optimize this by passing a reference to the `split` function and modifying it directly instead of creating a new vector.

3. Avoid unnecessary function calls:
   The code uses the `bfs` function to perform the BFS traversal. However, this function is only called within the `findans` function and can be transformed into a private member function of the `graph` class. This avoids unnecessary function calls and improves code readability.

4. Remove redundant code:
   The code initializes the `grcol` vector to [0, 1] before the BFS traversal loop in the `findans` function. However, this initialization is redundant because the vector is already initialized to [0, 0] when it is declared.

5. Use `reserve` for vector resizing:
   The code currently resizes the `powr` vector inside the loop, resulting in multiple reallocations. We can improve efficiency by using the `reserve` function to preallocate the required memory for the vector.

6. Avoid unnecessary variable shadowing:
   The code uses the variable `k` as both a global variable and a local variable inside the `bfs` function. This can cause confusion and lead to bugs. It is recommended to use different variable names to avoid shadowing.

7. Remove unnecessary type aliases:
   The code defines several type aliases using the `typedef` keyword. However, these aliases are not used in the code and can be safely removed.

8. Avoid unnecessary C++ includes:
   The code includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header, which is not standard and can lead to portability issues. It is recommended to include only the necessary standard C++ headers.

Taking these optimizations into consideration, here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <queue>

using namespace std;

class graphNode {
public:
  vector<int> adj;
  int a;
  graphNode() { a = 0; }
};

class graph {
public:
  int n;
  vector<graphNode> nodes;
  vector<int> powr;

  graph(int nodeNumber) {
    n = nodeNumber;
    nodes.resize(n + 1);
  }

  void addEdge(int a, int b, bool weighted = false, int weight = 0) {
    nodes[a].adj.push_back(b);
    nodes[b].adj.push_back(a);
    if (weighted) {
      nodes[a].wt.push_back(weight);
      nodes[b].wt.push_back(weight);
    }
  }

  long long findans() {
    vector<int> visited(n + 1, 0);
    vector<int> col(n + 1);
    vector<int> grcol(3);
    grcol[1] = 1;
    long long res = 1;

    for (int c = 1; c < n + 1; c++) {
      if (!visited[c]) {
        col[c] = 1;
        if (!bfs(c, col, visited, grcol)) {
          return 0;
        } else {
          res = (res * (powr[grcol[1]] + powr[grcol[2]])) % 998244353;
        }
        grcol[2] = 0;
        grcol[1] = 1;
      }
    }

    return res;
  }

private:
  bool bfs(int p, vector<int>& col, vector<int>& visited, vector<int>& grcol) {
    queue<int> q;
    visited[p] = 1;
    q.push(p);

    while (!q.empty()) {
      int itr = q.front();
      q.pop();
      int chcol = (col[itr] == 2) ? 1 : 2;

      for (int i = 0; i < nodes[itr].adj.size(); i++) {
        int k = nodes[itr].adj[i];

        if (col[k] == 0 || col[k] == chcol) {
          if (col[k] == 0) {
            col[k] = chcol;
            grcol[chcol]++;
          }
        } else {
          return false;
        }

        if (!visited[k]) {
          visited[k] = 1;
          q.push(k);
        }
      }
    }

    return true;
  }
};

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  cout.tie(NULL);

  vector<int> powr(3 * 100000);
  long long k = 1;

  for (int c = 0; c < 3 * 100000; c++) {
    powr[c] = k;
    k = (k * 2) % 998244353;
  }

  int t;
  cin >> t;

  while (t--) {
    int n, m;
    cin >> n >> m;
    graph mygraph(n);

    for (int c = 0; c < m; c++) {
      int a, b;
      cin >> a >> b;
      mygraph.addEdge(a, b);
    }

    cout << mygraph.findans() << endl;
  }

  return 0;
}
```

These changes should improve the efficiency of the code by reducing memory usage and eliminating unnecessary function calls and redundant code.
