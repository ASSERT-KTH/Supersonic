The given code appears to implement a graph algorithm to solve a specific problem. However, there are several areas where the code can be optimized for better performance and memory usage. Let's go through each optimization step one by one:

1. Remove Unused Code: There are several unused code snippets and macros in the given code, such as `#define MAX 20000000`. We can safely remove these unused parts to reduce the code size and improve readability.

2. Avoid Unnecessary Memory Allocation: The `split` function uses a vector to store the split strings. However, we can avoid this memory allocation by directly processing the split strings without storing them in a vector. This will reduce memory usage and improve performance.

3. Avoid Unnecessary Stringstream Usage: The `arrStr` function uses a stringstream to construct a string representation of an array. Instead of using a stringstream, we can directly construct the string using a loop. This will eliminate the overhead of creating and manipulating a stringstream object.

4. Avoid Unnecessary Vector Copies: The `vector<bool> visited` is passed by value to the `bfs` function. This results in creating a copy of the vector for each function call, which can be expensive. We can pass it by reference to avoid the unnecessary vector copy.

5. Use Constant References: The `findans` function takes several arguments, such as `col` and `grcol`, by value. These arguments are not modified within the function, so we can pass them by constant reference to avoid unnecessary copying.

6. Avoid Unnecessary Queue Operations: The `bfs` function uses a queue to perform breadth-first search. However, the queue is used to iterate over the adjacent nodes of a vertex. We can replace the queue with a simple loop over the adjacent nodes, which will eliminate the overhead of queue operations.

7. Remove Unused Includes: The `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` includes a large number of standard library headers, which can increase compilation time. We should only include the necessary headers to reduce compilation time.

8. Use `reserve` for Vector Resizing: The `powr` vector is resized inside the loop, which can result in frequent reallocations and copies. We can use the `reserve` function to preallocate memory for the vector before entering the loop.

9. Replace Magic Numbers: There are several magic numbers in the code, such as `998244353` and `2`. We should use named constants or macros instead of magic numbers to improve code readability and maintainability.

10. Remove Redundant Code: The `res = (res * (powr[grcol[1]] + powr[grcol[2]])) % 998244353` line can be simplified to `res = (res * (powr[grcol[1]] + powr[grcol[2]])) % mod` to avoid the use of a magic number.

Now, let's apply these optimizations to the code:
