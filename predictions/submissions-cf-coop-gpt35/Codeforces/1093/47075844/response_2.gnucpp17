The given code appears to be a C++ program that solves a graph coloring problem. It defines several macros and includes various standard libraries. The main optimization opportunities in this code include:

1. Removing unnecessary headers: The code includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header, which is not a standard header and can slow down the compilation process. It is recommended to include only the necessary standard headers.

2. Reducing the number of macro definitions: The code defines several macros that are not used in the program. Removing these unused macros can improve code readability.

3. Avoiding unnecessary data structures: The code uses a `vector<string>` to split a string, but it can be replaced with a more efficient algorithm that avoids unnecessary memory allocations.

4. Avoiding unnecessary computations: The code calculates and stores powers of 2 in a vector, but it only uses a small portion of the vector. It is more efficient to calculate the required powers on the fly.

5. Optimizing graph traversal: The code uses a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to traverse the graph, but it can be optimized to reduce redundant checks and memory usage.

6. Using more efficient data structures: The code uses `vector<bool>` for marking visited nodes, which can be memory inefficient. It is recommended to use a `vector<char>` or `bitset` instead.

Based on these observations, the following optimization strategy can be formulated:

1. Remove unnecessary headers and unused macros.
2. Replace the vector-based string splitting algorithm with a more efficient algorithm.
3. Remove the unnecessary vector for storing powers of 2.
4. Optimize the BFS algorithm for graph traversal.
5. Replace the `vector<bool>` with a more efficient data structure.
