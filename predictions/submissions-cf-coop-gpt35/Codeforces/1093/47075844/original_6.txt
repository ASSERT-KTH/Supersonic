The given code is a C++ program that solves a graph problem. The program reads the number of test cases, followed by the number of nodes and edges in each test case. It then reads the edges and constructs a graph using an adjacency list representation. Finally, it computes the answer for each test case using a BFS algorithm and outputs the result.

To optimize this program, we can focus on the following areas:

1. Unnecessary includes: The `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` includes a large number of standard library headers, which can slow down the compilation process. We can replace it with only the necessary header files.

2. Redundant typedefs: The program includes multiple typedefs for common types such as `int` and `vector<int>`. We can remove these typedefs as they are not used in the program.

3. Unnecessary vector copy: The `split` function unnecessarily creates a copy of the vector `v` using `move`. Since the vector is returned by value, there is no need to use `move`. We can simply return the vector directly.

4. Unused template function: The `arrStr` template function is not used anywhere in the program. We can safely remove it.

5. Unused macros: Several macros such as `mod`, `MAX`, `sz`, `ln`, `pb`, `mp`, `finc`, `fdec`, `fincp`, `fdecp`, `PI`, `E`, `by`, `grsort`, `F`, `S`, `mem`, `mnv`, `mxv`, and `pr` are defined but not used. We can remove these macros.

6. Inefficient powr vector initialization: The `powr` vector is initialized with a size of `3 * 100000` elements using a for loop. We can optimize this by using the `resize` function of the vector, which initializes the vector with the specified size and sets all elements to the default value.

7. Redundant variable declaration: The `k` variable is declared twice in the main function. We can remove the second declaration to avoid confusion.

8. Inefficient BFS implementation: The BFS implementation in the `bfs` function can be optimized. Currently, it uses a vector to track visited nodes, which has a time complexity of O(n) for each node. We can replace it with a boolean array, which has a time complexity of O(1) for each node.

9. Inefficient calculation of result: The calculation of the result in the `findans` function can be optimized. Currently, it uses the `powr` vector to calculate the result modulo 998244353. We can optimize this by using modular exponentiation to calculate the result in a more efficient way.

10. Inefficient graph representation: The graph is represented using an adjacency list, which requires O(n + m) space, where n is the number of nodes and m is the number of edges. We can optimize this by using a more compact representation such as an adjacency matrix, which requires O(n^2) space but can provide faster access to edges.

Now, let's apply these optimizations step by step to the given code.
