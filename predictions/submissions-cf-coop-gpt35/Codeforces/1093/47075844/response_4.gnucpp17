The given code is a C++ program that solves a graph problem. The program defines several utility functions and classes, including a graph class and a graphNode class. The graph class represents a graph and provides methods to add edges and find a solution to the problem. The graphNode class represents a node in the graph and stores its adjacent nodes and weights.

Upon analyzing the code, the following potential performance bottlenecks and inefficient memory usage can be identified:

1. Unnecessary includes: The code includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header, which includes almost all standard library headers. This can lead to increased compilation time and unnecessary memory usage. It is recommended to include only the required headers.

2. Excessive use of `using namespace std`: The code uses the `using namespace std` directive, which brings all the names from the `std` namespace into the current scope. This can lead to name collisions and make the code less readable. It is recommended to use the `std::` prefix when referring to standard library names.

3. Redundant `split` function: The code defines a `split` function that splits a string into a vector of strings based on a delimiter. However, this function is not used in the code and can be removed.

4. Unoptimized string concatenation: The `arrStr` function uses string concatenation to build a string representation of an array. However, this can be inefficient, especially for large arrays. It is recommended to use a `stringstream` instead.

5. Unused debug macros: The code defines several debug macros (`EVARS`, `debug`) that print variable values for debugging purposes. These macros are not used in the code and can be removed.

6. Unused preprocessor directives: The code defines several preprocessor directives (`mod`, `MAX`, `test`, etc.) that are not used in the code. These directives can be removed.

7. Inefficient vector initialization: The `powr` vector is initialized with a size of `3 * 100000` and then filled with values using a loop. However, this can be done more efficiently using the `resize` function with a default value.

8. Unnecessary memory allocation: The `nodes` vector in the `graph` class is resized to `n + 1` elements, but the last element is not used. This can lead to unnecessary memory allocation. It is recommended to resize the vector to `n` elements instead.

9. Inefficient use of vectors: The `adj` and `wt` vectors in the `graphNode` class are used to store adjacent nodes and their weights. However, a more memory-efficient representation can be used, such as an adjacency list or a matrix.

10. Inefficient use of queues: The `bfs` function uses a queue to perform breadth-first search. However, the implementation can be optimized to avoid unnecessary memory allocations and deallocations.

11. Redundant variable redeclaration: The code redeclares the `n` and `k` variables in the `main` function, which shadows the global variables with the same names. This can lead to confusion and potential bugs. It is recommended to remove the redeclarations.

Based on the analysis, the following optimization strategy can be formulated:

1. Remove unnecessary includes.
2. Replace `using namespace std` with `std::` prefix.
3. Remove the unused `split` function.
4. Optimize the `arrStr` function by using a `stringstream`.
5. Remove the unused debug macros.
6. Remove the unused preprocessor directives.
7. Use `resize` with a default value instead of a loop to initialize the `powr` vector.
8. Resize the `nodes` vector in the `graph` class to `n` elements instead of `n + 1`.
9. Optimize the representation of adjacent nodes and weights in the `graphNode` class.
10. Optimize the `bfs` function to avoid unnecessary memory allocations and deallocations.
11. Remove the redundant variable redeclarations in the `main` function.
