The given code is an implementation of a segment tree with some additional functionality. It takes input in the form of a matrix `a` and performs two types of queries:

1. Update query: Update a specific row of the matrix `a` with a new vector `b`.
2. Query type 2: Find the maximum difference between the largest and smallest element in a specified range of rows.

The code uses a segment tree data structure to efficiently answer these queries. However, there are several areas where the code can be optimized for better performance and memory usage.

Here is an optimization strategy for this code:

1. Avoid unnecessary includes: The code includes many unnecessary headers. Remove the headers that are not used in the code, such as `<cmath>`, `<cstdlib>`, `<optional>`, `<stack>`, and `<type_traits>`. This will reduce compile time and improve build performance.

2. Optimize I/O operations: The code uses `std::cin` and `std::cout` for input and output. These operations are slower compared to other I/O methods like `scanf` and `printf`. Consider replacing `std::cin` and `std::cout` with `scanf` and `printf` for faster I/O.

3. Use fixed-size arrays instead of vectors: The code uses a vector of vectors `a` to store the matrix data. Since the size of the matrix is known at compile time, it can be more efficient to use fixed-size arrays instead of vectors. This will reduce memory allocation and deallocation overhead.

4. Optimize segment tree initialization: The code initializes each segment tree node individually, which leads to multiple function calls and unnecessary overhead. Instead, initialize all nodes of the segment tree in a single pass by using a bottom-up approach. This will reduce the number of function calls and improve initialization performance.

5. Avoid unnecessary calculations inside loops: The code performs repetitive calculations inside loops, such as calculating the value of `val` for each row and mask combination. These calculations can be moved outside the loops to avoid redundant computations.

6. Optimize update queries: The code updates each segment tree individually for each mask and row combination. Instead, update the segment tree for each mask in a single pass by calculating the new `val` for each row and mask combination. This will reduce the number of function calls and improve update query performance.

7. Optimize query type 2: The code performs a separate query for each mask to find the maximum difference. Instead, calculate the maximum difference for all masks in a single pass. This can be done by maintaining two variables, `max_diff` and `min_diff`, and updating them accordingly while traversing the segment tree.

8. Use loop unrolling: The code uses a loop to iterate over all the masks in the update and query type 2 operations. Loop unrolling can be applied to process multiple masks in a single iteration, reducing loop overhead and improving performance.

9. Use compiler optimizations: Utilize compiler optimizations to improve the performance of the code. Enable compiler optimizations using appropriate compiler flags or pragmas. This will allow the compiler to optimize the code based on the target architecture and generate more efficient machine code.

Now let's apply these optimization steps to the given code:
