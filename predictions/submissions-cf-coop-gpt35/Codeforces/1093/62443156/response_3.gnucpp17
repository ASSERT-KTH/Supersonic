The given code appears to be a C++ program that solves a problem using a segment tree. The segment tree is constructed to efficiently answer queries about the maximum difference between two values in a subarray. The program takes input values, constructs the segment tree, and then processes a series of queries.

To optimize the code for efficiency, we can follow these steps:

1. Use a more efficient data structure for the segment tree nodes:
   - The current implementation uses `std::pair<int, int>` as the data type for each node in the segment tree. This data structure requires two `int` values to be stored for each node, resulting in more memory usage.
   - We can optimize the memory usage by using a single `int` value to represent the difference between the minimum and maximum values in the subarray represented by each node.
   - This change will reduce the memory consumption of the segment tree and potentially improve cache efficiency.

2. Avoid redundant computations:
   - The code performs multiple computations to calculate the difference between two values in each subarray. These computations can be avoided by precomputing the cumulative sums of the elements in each subarray.
   - By using the cumulative sums, we can calculate the difference between any two values in constant time, rather than iterating through the subarray and performing individual subtractions.
   - This change will reduce the overall number of computations and improve the running time of the program.

3. Optimize loops and recursive calls:
   - The code uses nested loops to iterate over the elements of the input array and perform various operations. We can optimize these loops by:
     - Using range-based for loops instead of traditional index-based loops, which can eliminate the need for explicit index variables.
     - Minimizing the number of loop iterations by using iterators and iterators' arithmetic.
   - Additionally, the code uses recursive calls to traverse the segment tree. We can optimize these recursive calls by converting them into iterative loops, which can eliminate the overhead of function calls and improve performance.

4. Utilize compiler optimizations:
   - We can use compiler optimizations to improve the performance of the code. For example, we can enable compiler flags such as `-O3` or `-Ofast` to enable aggressive optimization.
   - Additionally, we can use compiler-specific pragmas or directives to provide hints to the compiler about specific optimizations that can be applied to the code.
