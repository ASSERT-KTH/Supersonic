The given code is a C++ program that solves a problem using a segment tree data structure. The program takes an input of `n` (the number of elements) and `k` (the number of attributes), followed by `n` lines of `k` integers each representing the attributes. It then constructs a segment tree for each subset of attributes and performs updates and queries on the segment trees based on user input.

Upon analysis of the code, the following potential performance bottlenecks and areas for optimization are identified:

1. Memory usage: The program uses a vector of vectors (`a`) to store the input attributes, which can be memory-intensive for large input sizes.

2. Segment tree initialization: The segment trees are initialized with a default value of `{1e9, -1e9}`, which requires unnecessary memory allocation and initialization.

3. Update and query operations: The update and query operations on the segment trees use nested loops, which can result in redundant computations and sub-optimal performance.

4. Input/output operations: The code uses `cin` and `cout` for input/output operations, which can be slower compared to other input/output methods.

Based on these observations, the following optimization strategy can be formulated:

1. Optimize memory usage by using a more efficient data structure to store the input attributes.

2. Optimize segment tree initialization by avoiding unnecessary memory allocation and initialization.

3. Optimize update and query operations by reducing redundant computations and simplifying the nested loops.

4. Optimize input/output operations by using a more efficient input/output method.
