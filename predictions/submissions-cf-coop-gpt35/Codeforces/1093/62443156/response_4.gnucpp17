The provided code is a C++ program that solves a dynamic programming problem using a segment tree data structure. The program takes input parameters `n` and `k`, followed by a 2D array `a` of size `n`x`k`. It then initializes a vector of segment trees `trees`, where each tree stores the maximum and minimum values for a given subset of the array `a`. Finally, the program performs a series of queries and prints the results.

To optimize this code, we can focus on the following areas:

1. Reducing Memory Usage: The program uses a 2D vector `a` to store the input array. Since the size of the array is fixed at `n`x`k`, we can replace the 2D vector with a 1D vector to save memory.

2. Improving Time Complexity: The program currently uses nested loops to iterate over the input array and update the segment trees. We can optimize this by using bitwise operations and bitmasking to iterate over all possible subsets of the array more efficiently.

3. Minimizing Redundant Computations: The current implementation recomputes the values for each subset of the array for every query. We can optimize this by precomputing the values for all subsets of the array once and reusing them for each query.

4. Compiler Optimizations: We can suggest compiler optimizations or pragma directives to hint the compiler about potential optimizations, such as loop unrolling or vectorization.
