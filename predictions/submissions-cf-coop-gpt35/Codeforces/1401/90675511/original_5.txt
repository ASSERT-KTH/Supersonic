The given code reads an integer `t` as input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n`, followed by an array `a` of size `n`. The code then finds the minimum element `m` in the array `a`, and creates two arrays `b` and `c` to store the indices and values of the elements in `a` that are divisible by `m`. It sorts the array `c`, and then rearranges the elements in `a` based on the sorted values in `c`. Finally, it checks if the array `a` is sorted in non-decreasing order and prints "YES" or "NO" accordingly.

To optimize this code, we can make the following changes:

1. Avoid unnecessary includes: The line `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` includes all standard library headers, which can slow down the compilation process. We can replace it with the specific headers that are required by the code.

2. Remove unnecessary input/output synchronization: The lines `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0);`, `cin.tie(0);`, and `cout.tie(0);` disable the synchronization between C and C++ standard streams, which can improve the performance of input/output operations. However, in this code, there are no interleaved input/output operations, so we can remove these lines.

3. Use a more efficient data structure for arrays `b` and `c`: The arrays `b` and `c` are used to store the indices and values of the elements in `a` that are divisible by `m`. Instead of using separate arrays, we can use a single array of pairs to store both the index and value. This will reduce the memory usage and improve cache locality.

4. Avoid unnecessary sorting: The array `c` is sorted, but the sorted values are then used to rearrange the elements in `a`. Instead of sorting `c` and then rearranging the elements in `a`, we can rearrange the elements in `a` directly using a stable sorting algorithm. This will eliminate the need for sorting `c` and improve the overall performance.

5. Use a flag variable for early termination: The code checks if the array `a` is sorted in non-decreasing order by comparing adjacent elements. If a violation is found, the flag variable is set to 1 and the loop is terminated. However, we can optimize this by using a flag variable that is initialized to `false` before the loop. If a violation is found, we can set the flag variable to `true` and break out of the loop immediately. This will avoid unnecessary iterations once a violation is detected.

6. Remove unnecessary variable `k`: The variable `k` is used to keep track of the number of elements in arrays `b` and `c`. However, we can replace `k` with the `std::vector` `b` and avoid the need for a separate counter variable. This will simplify the code and improve memory management.

Taking these optimization steps into consideration, the optimized code is as follows:
