Code Analysis:
The provided code takes an input `t` which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it takes an input `n` which represents the number of elements in an array `a`. Then it reads `n` integers as input and performs the following operations:
1. Finds the minimum value `m` in `a`.
2. Creates two arrays `b` and `c` of size `n` to store the indices and values of elements in `a` that are divisible by `m`.
3. Sorts the array `c` in ascending order.
4. Rearranges the elements in array `a` by replacing the elements at indices stored in `b` with the corresponding elements in `c`.
5. Checks if `a` is in non-decreasing order and outputs "YES" if true, and "NO" otherwise.

Potential optimizations:
1. Avoid using `bits/stdc++.h`: The code includes the header `<bits/stdc++.h>` which is not a standard C++ header and is not recommended. It includes all standard library headers, which can lead to slower compilation times. It is better to include only the required standard library headers.
2. Avoid using dynamic arrays: The code uses dynamic arrays `a`, `b`, and `c`. Dynamic arrays have additional overhead for memory allocation and deallocation. It is better to use `std::vector` which provides a more efficient and flexible alternative.
3. Avoid unnecessary sorting: The code sorts the array `c` even though the elements in `c` are already in ascending order. This sorting step can be removed.
4. Optimize the check for non-decreasing order: The code checks if `a` is in non-decreasing order by comparing each element with its next element. This can be optimized by checking if any element is greater than its next element in a single pass.
5. Use more efficient data structures: The code uses an integer variable `m` to store the minimum value in `a`. Instead of iterating over `a` to find the minimum value, we can use `std::min_element` function from the `<algorithm>` header.
6. Avoid unnecessary memory usage: The code uses arrays `b` and `c` to store the indices and values of elements in `a` that are divisible by `m`. Instead of storing the indices, we can directly update the corresponding elements in `a` without using additional arrays.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Replace the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header with the necessary standard library headers.
2. Replace the dynamic arrays `a`, `b`, and `c` with `std::vector`.
3. Use `std::min_element` to find the minimum value `m` in `a`.
4. Replace the loop that populates `b` and `c` with a single pass loop that updates `a` directly.
5. Optimize the check for non-decreasing order by using a flag variable.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Replace the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header with the necessary standard library headers:
   - Remove the line `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`.
   - Add the necessary standard library headers, such as `<iostream>`, `<algorithm>`, and `<vector>`.
   
2. Replace the dynamic arrays `a`, `b`, and `c` with `std::vector`:
   - Replace the lines `int a[n], b[n], c[n];` with `std::vector<int> a(n), b, c;`.
   - Remove the line `int k = 0;`.
   
3. Use `std::min_element` to find the minimum value `m` in `a`:
   - Replace the lines `int m = INT_MAX;` and the loop `if (a[i] < m) m = a[i];` with `int m = *std::min_element(a.begin(), a.end());`.
   
4. Replace the loop that populates `b` and `c` with a single pass loop that updates `a` directly:
   - Replace the loop
     ```
     int k = 0;
     for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
       if (a[i] % m == 0) {
         b[k] = i;
         c[k] = a[i];
         k++;
       }
     }
     ```
     with
     ```
     for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
       if (a[i] % m == 0) {
         a[i] = INT_MAX; // Use INT_MAX as a temporary placeholder
       }
     }
     ```
   - Add the line `b.reserve(n);` after the line `std::vector<int> b, c;` to reserve memory for `b`.
   
5. Optimize the check for non-decreasing order by using a flag variable:
   - Replace the loop
     ```
     int flag = 0;
     for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++)
       if (a[i] > a[i + 1]) {
         flag = 1;
         break;
       }
     ```
     with
     ```
     bool flag = false;
     for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
       if (a[i] > a[i + 1]) {
         flag = true;
         break;
       }
     }
     ```

Optimized Code Block:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0);
  cin.tie(0);
  cout.tie(0);

  int t;
  cin >> t;

  for (; t--;) {
    int n;
    cin >> n;

    vector<int> a(n), b, c;
    b.reserve(n);

    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      cin >> a[i];
    }

    int m = *min_element(a.begin(), a.end());

    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      if (a[i] % m == 0) {
        a[i] = INT_MAX;
      }
    }

    bool flag = false;
    for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
      if (a[i] > a[i + 1]) {
        flag = true;
        break;
      }
    }

    if (flag) {
      cout << "NO" << "\n";
    } else {
      cout << "YES" << "\n";
    }
  }
}
```

The optimized code eliminates the unnecessary sorting step and improves the memory usage by using `std::vector` instead of dynamic arrays. It also optimizes the loop to find the minimum value in `a` and improves the check for non-decreasing order. These changes should lead to improved performance and reduced memory usage compared to the original code.
