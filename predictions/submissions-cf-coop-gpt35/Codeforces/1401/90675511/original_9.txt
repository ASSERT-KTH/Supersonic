The given code reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` followed by `n` integers into an array `a`. The code then finds the minimum value `m` in the array `a` and stores the indices and values of the elements divisible by `m` in arrays `b` and `c` respectively. It sorts the array `c` and updates the elements of `a` at indices given by `b` with the sorted values from `c`. Finally, it checks if the elements of `a` are sorted in non-decreasing order and prints "YES" or "NO" accordingly.

Upon analysis, the following potential optimizations can be made to improve the performance and memory usage of the code:

1. Avoid using `bits/stdc++.h` header: This header includes all the standard library headers, which can increase the compilation time and result in unnecessary code bloat. It is better to include only the required headers explicitly.

2. Avoid using dynamic-sized arrays: The code currently uses arrays `a`, `b`, and `c` with dynamic sizes based on the input value of `n`. Dynamic-sized arrays can lead to inefficient memory usage and potential buffer overflows. Instead, we can use `std::vector` which provides dynamic sizing without the risks associated with raw arrays.

3. Avoid unnecessary sorting: The code sorts array `c` even though we only need the minimum value from it. Sorting the entire array is an unnecessary computation that can be avoided.

4. Optimize the check for non-decreasing order: The code checks if the elements of `a` are sorted in non-decreasing order by iterating through the array and comparing adjacent elements. This can be optimized by breaking out of the loop as soon as a violation is found.

With these optimizations in mind, let's proceed with the step-by-step explanation of the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <climits>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(nullptr);
  cout.tie(nullptr);

  int t;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    int n;
    cin >> n;
    vector<int> a(n);
    int m = INT_MAX;

    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      cin >> a[i];
      if (a[i] < m)
        m = a[i];
    }

    vector<int> b, c;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      if (a[i] % m == 0) {
        b.push_back(i);
        c.push_back(a[i]);
      }
    }

    int k = b.size();

    // Sort only if needed
    if (k > 1)
      sort(c.begin(), c.end());

    for (int i = 0; i < k; i++)
      a[b[i]] = c[i];

    bool isSorted = true;
    for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
      if (a[i] > a[i + 1]) {
        isSorted = false;
        break;
      }
    }

    if (isSorted)
      cout << "YES\n";
    else
      cout << "NO\n";
  }

  return 0;
}
```

In the optimized code:
1. The unnecessary `bits/stdc++.h` header is removed, and only the required headers are included explicitly.
2. Dynamic-sized arrays are replaced with `std::vector`.
3. Sorting of array `c` is performed only if there are more than one element in it.
4. The check for non-decreasing order is optimized to break out of the loop as soon as a violation is found.
5. The `iostream` optimization `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false)` is applied to improve the input/output performance.

These optimizations result in improved memory usage and reduced computation time, while preserving the functionality and output of the original code.
