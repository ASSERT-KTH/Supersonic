The provided code reads an integer `t` as input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` followed by `n` integers representing an array `a`. The code then checks if the array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by performing the following steps:

1. Find the minimum element `m` in the array `a`.
2. Create two arrays `b` and `c` to store the indices and values of elements in `a` that are divisible by `m`.
3. Sort the array `c` in non-decreasing order.
4. Reorder the elements in `a` using the indices in `b` and the sorted values in `c`.
5. Check if the resulting array `a` is sorted in non-decreasing order and output "YES" or "NO" accordingly.

To optimize this code, we can focus on the following areas:

1. Memory allocation: The code uses three arrays `a`, `b`, and `c`, each of size `n`. This can be inefficient, especially if `n` is large. We can use dynamic memory allocation or use alternative data structures to minimize memory usage.

2. Sorting: The code uses the `std::sort` function to sort the array `c`. Depending on the size of `c`, this can be an expensive operation. We can explore alternative sorting algorithms or consider sorting only the necessary elements.

3. Loop optimization: The code uses multiple loops to iterate over the arrays. We can consider loop unrolling or optimizing the loop conditions to reduce the number of iterations.

4. Compiler optimizations: We can enable specific compiler optimizations or use pragma directives to guide the compiler in optimizing the code.

Let's optimize the code step by step.
