Upon analyzing the given code, I have identified several potential areas for optimization:

1. Unnecessary inclusion of the entire `bits/stdc++.h` library: The `bits/stdc++.h` library includes a large number of standard libraries, which can increase the compilation time and make the code less portable. We can replace it with the specific necessary headers, such as `<iostream>` and `<vector>`, to reduce unnecessary code bloat.

2. Redundant computation of `mn` and `mn2`: Currently, the code computes `mn` and `mn2` separately using conditional statements. We can optimize this by combining the conditions into a single statement and calculating `mn` and `mn2` in one go.

3. Use of `std::endl` instead of `'\n'`: The code uses `std::endl` to end each line, which flushes the output stream buffer unnecessarily. We can replace it with `'\n'`, which only inserts a newline character and is more efficient.

4. Lack of comments: The code lacks comments, making it difficult to understand the purpose and logic of each section. We should add comments to improve code readability and maintainability.

Based on these observations, the optimization strategy is as follows:

1. Replace the `bits/stdc++.h` library with the specific necessary headers.
2. Combine the conditional statements for computing `mn` and `mn2`.
3. Replace `std::endl` with `'\n'`.
4. Add comments to explain the purpose and logic of each section.

Now, let's proceed with the step-by-step explanation and provide the optimized code.
