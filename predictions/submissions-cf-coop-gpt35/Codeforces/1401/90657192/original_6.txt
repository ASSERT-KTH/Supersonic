The provided code calculates the value of `ans` for each test case using a series of `min` operations and subtraction. It also uses a few unnecessary variables like `temp` that can be eliminated to improve efficiency. Here is a step-by-step optimization strategy:

1. Remove unnecessary includes and macros: The `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` and `#define ll long long` statements are not needed and can be removed.

2. Remove unnecessary I/O synchronization: The `IOS` macro is not necessary as the program does not perform any concurrent I/O operations. The I/O synchronization can be disabled by removing the `IOS` macro and the related function calls.

3. Remove unnecessary `using` statement: The `using namespace std;` statement can be removed to avoid importing the entire `std` namespace. Instead, we can use the `std::` prefix to specify the standard library functions and types.

4. Optimize the calculation of `ans`: Instead of using multiple `min` operations and subtraction, we can simplify the calculation of `ans` using a single formula. The updated formula is as follows:
   ```
   ans = 2 * min(c1, b2) - 2 * min(a1, c2) - 2 * min(b1, c2)
   ```

5. Remove unnecessary variables: The `temp` variable is not necessary and can be eliminated. We can directly use the `min` function calls in the formula for `ans`.

6. Optimize the loop: The loop can be optimized by using a more efficient loop counter and precalculating the values of `min(c1, b2)` and `min(a1, c2)` outside the loop.

7. Add compiler optimizations: We can add compiler optimizations to improve the performance of the code. For example, we can use the `-O3` flag to enable aggressive optimization during compilation.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  std::cin.tie(nullptr);
  std::cout.tie(nullptr);

  int t;
  std::cin >> t;

  while (t--) {
    int a1, b1, c1, a2, b2, c2;
    std::cin >> a1 >> b1 >> c1 >> a2 >> b2 >> c2;

    int ans = 2 * std::min(c1, b2) - 2 * std::min(a1, c2) - 2 * std::min(b1, c2);
    std::cout << ans << '\n';
  }

  return 0;
}
```

This optimized code reduces the number of operations and eliminates unnecessary variables, resulting in improved efficiency. Additionally, the code is more readable and maintainable due to the removal of unnecessary includes, macros, and the use of explicit namespace qualification.
