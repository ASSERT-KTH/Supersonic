Code Analysis:

1. The code uses the "#include <bits/stdc++.h>" header file, which includes all standard library headers. This can result in slower compilation times and increased memory usage. It is better to include only the necessary headers.

2. The code uses the "using namespace std;" directive, which imports all names from the std namespace into the global namespace. This can lead to naming conflicts and make the code less readable. It is better to use the "std::" prefix when using names from the std namespace.

3. The code uses the "int32_t" data type for the main function, which is not necessary. The standard signature for the main function is "int main()".

4. The code uses the "ll" alias for "long long" data type, which is not necessary. It is better to directly use "long long".

5. There are multiple unnecessary temporary variables used, such as "temp". These variables can be eliminated to reduce memory usage.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Replace the "#include <bits/stdc++.h>" header with the necessary standard library headers, such as <iostream> and <algorithm>.

2. Remove the "using namespace std;" directive and use the "std::" prefix when using names from the std namespace.

3. Change the main function signature to "int main()".

4. Remove the "ll" alias for "long long" data type.

5. Eliminate unnecessary temporary variables.

Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. Replace the "#include <bits/stdc++.h>" header with the necessary standard library headers, such as <iostream> and <algorithm>. This will reduce the compilation time and memory usage.

2. Remove the "using namespace std;" directive and use the "std::" prefix when using names from the std namespace. This will avoid naming conflicts and make the code more readable.

3. Change the main function signature to "int main()". The "int32_t" data type is not necessary and the standard signature for the main function is "int main()".

4. Remove the "ll" alias for "long long" data type. It is not necessary and using "long long" directly is clearer.

5. Eliminate unnecessary temporary variables, such as "temp". These variables are not needed and can be replaced with their respective expressions.

Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>

int main() {
  std::ios::sync_with_stdio(0);
  std::cin.tie(0);
  std::cout.tie(0);

  int t;
  std::cin >> t;

  while (t--) {
    long long a1, b1, c1, a2, b2, c2;
    std::cin >> a1 >> b1 >> c1 >> a2 >> b2 >> c2;

    long long ans = 0;
    ans += std::min(c1, b2) * 2;
    c1 -= std::min(c1, b2);
    b2 -= std::min(c1, b2);
    c2 -= std::min(c1, c2);
    c2 -= std::min(a1, c2);
    ans -= 2 * std::min(b1, c2);

    std::cout << ans << std::endl;
  }

  return 0;
}
