The provided code is a simple program that takes input in the form of test cases and checks if the given values satisfy a certain condition. The code appears to be correct, but there are several areas that can be optimized for efficiency:

1. Avoid including the entire `<bits/stdc++.h>` header: This header includes almost all the standard library headers, which can significantly increase compilation time and memory usage. Instead, only include the necessary headers, such as `<iostream>` and `<algorithm>`.

2. Avoid using `using namespace std;`: This statement pollutes the global namespace and can lead to naming conflicts. It is better to explicitly use the `std::` prefix when necessary.

3. Minimize input/output operations: The code currently performs multiple input/output operations within the loop, which can be time-consuming. Instead, consider reading all the test case inputs at once and storing them in a data structure for faster access.

4. Avoid unnecessary variable declarations: The variables `max1` and `max2` are unnecessary and can be eliminated. We can directly compare the maximum values without storing them in separate variables.

5. Optimize conditional check: The current conditional check involves multiple comparisons and additions. This can be simplified to a single comparison by directly checking if the sum of the smaller values is equal to the larger value.

6. Use newline character instead of `std::endl`: `std::endl` flushes the output stream, which can add unnecessary overhead. Instead, use the newline character (`'\n'`) for better performance.
