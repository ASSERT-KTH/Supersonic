The given code reads an integer `t` and then for each test case, it reads four integers `a1`, `b1`, `a2`, `b2`. It then checks if the maximum of `a1` and `b1` is equal to the maximum of `a2` and `b2`, and if the sum of the minimum of `a1` and `b1` and the minimum of `a2` and `b2` is equal to the maximum. If both conditions are true, it prints "YES", otherwise it prints "NO".

Let's analyze the code to identify potential areas for optimization:

1. The code includes unnecessary header `<bits/stdc++.h>`. It is better to include only the necessary headers which will reduce compilation time and avoid potential conflicts.

2. The code uses `using namespace std;`. While it is convenient, it is generally considered a good practice to avoid it in larger projects to prevent naming conflicts.

3. The code uses `cin` and `cout` for input and output. These operations can be slow, especially for large inputs or outputs. Using `scanf` and `printf` functions from the C library can provide faster I/O.

4. The code uses `max` and `min` functions from the `<algorithm>` header. These functions have a small overhead and can be replaced with simple conditional statements to improve performance.

5. The code performs unnecessary computations. It calculates the maximum of `a1` and `b1` twice. It also calculates the minimum of `a1`, `b1`, `a2`, and `b2` twice.

6. The code uses `endl` to output a newline character. Using `'\n'` instead of `endl` can be more efficient as it avoids flushing the output buffer.
