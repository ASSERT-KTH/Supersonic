The given code appears to solve a problem for multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads in four integers and performs some calculations to determine whether a certain condition is met. The result is then printed to the console.

To optimize this code, we can focus on a few areas:

1. Input/Output: The code currently uses `cin` and `cout` for input and output operations. These operations can be slow, especially when performing a large number of them. Switching to a faster input/output mechanism, such as `scanf` and `printf`, can improve performance.

2. Redundant Calculations: The code calculates `max(a1, b1)` and `max(a2, b2)` twice, even though the values do not change within the loop. We can calculate these values once before the loop and reuse them.

3. Min/Max Calculation: The code uses `min` and `max` functions to calculate the minimum and maximum values. These function calls can be expensive. We can replace them with simple conditional statements to avoid the function call overhead.

4. Compiler Optimizations: We can use compiler optimizations to help the generated code run faster. For example, enabling compiler optimizations (`-O2` flag) can inline functions, unroll loops, and perform other optimizations automatically.
