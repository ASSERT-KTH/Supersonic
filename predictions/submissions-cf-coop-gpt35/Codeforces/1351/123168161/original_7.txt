Code Analysis:
The given code is a simple program that reads an integer t, followed by t sets of four integers (a1, b1, a2, b2). For each set, the program checks if the maximum of a1 and b1 is equal to the maximum of a2 and b2, and if the sum of the minimum of a1 and b1 and the minimum of a2 and b2 is equal to the maximum value. Based on these conditions, it prints "YES" or "NO".

Potential Performance Bottlenecks:
1. Input/Output: The code uses the "cin" and "cout" functions from the iostream library for input and output. These functions can be slower compared to other input/output methods, such as using scanf and printf or optimizing the cin and cout streams.
2. Comparison and Arithmetic Operations: The code performs multiple comparison and arithmetic operations for each set of four integers. These operations can be optimized to reduce the number of computations.
3. Memory Usage: The code does not have any significant memory usage issues.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Input/Output Optimization: Replace the "cin" and "cout" functions with scanf and printf for faster input/output.
2. Arithmetic Optimization: Minimize the number of arithmetic operations by reusing variables and avoiding redundant computations.
3. Conditional Optimization: Simplify the conditional statement by removing unnecessary checks and logical operations.
4. Compiler Optimization: Enable compiler optimizations by providing hints to the compiler through compiler-specific pragmas or flags.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Input/Output Optimization:
   - Replace the "bits/stdc++.h" header with the necessary headers, such as "iostream" and "cstdio", to use the scanf and printf functions.
   - Replace the "cin" and "cout" functions with scanf and printf for faster input/output.

2. Arithmetic Optimization:
   - Combine the declaration and initialization of variables a1, b1, a2, and b2 in a single line to reduce code size and improve readability.
   - Combine the declaration and initialization of variables max1 and max2 in a single line to reduce code size and improve readability.
   - Combine the declaration and initialization of variables min1 and min2 in a single line to reduce code size and improve readability.
   - Compute the maximum and minimum values only once for each set of four integers, instead of computing them multiple times.

3. Conditional Optimization:
   - Simplify the conditional statement by removing the unnecessary check for max1 == max2, as it is already checked in the second part of the condition.
   - Simplify the conditional statement by removing the logical AND operation and directly comparing the sum of min1 and min2 with max1.

4. Compiler Optimization:
   - Add compiler-specific pragmas or flags to enable optimizations. This step depends on the specific compiler being used and its available options.
