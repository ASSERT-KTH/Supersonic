The provided code looks simple and straightforward. However, there are a few optimizations that can be made to improve its performance and memory usage.

1. Avoid including the entire `bits/stdc++.h` header. This header includes many other headers, which can increase the compilation time. Instead, only include the necessary headers (`iostream` and `algorithm`) that are actually used in the code.

2. Avoid using `using namespace std`. This practice is generally discouraged as it can lead to name clashes and make the code less readable. Instead, explicitly specify the namespace for each identifier used from the `std` namespace (e.g., `std::cin`, `std::cout`, `std::endl`, etc.).

3. Move the variable declarations outside the loop. In the current code, the variables `a1`, `b1`, `a2`, and `b2` are declared and initialized inside the loop for each iteration. Moving the declarations outside the loop will avoid unnecessary stack allocations and deallocations.

4. Avoid using `std::endl` for line breaks. The `std::endl` manipulator not only inserts a newline character but also flushes the output stream. This can be a costly operation, especially when printing large amounts of data. Instead, use the newline character `'\n'` to insert line breaks.

5. Simplify the condition in the if statement. The current condition checks if the maximum of `a1` and `b1` is equal to the maximum of `a2` and `b2`, and if the sum of the minimums is equal to the maximum. This condition can be simplified to just checking if the sum of the maximums is equal to the maximum.

Now, let's optimize the code step by step.
