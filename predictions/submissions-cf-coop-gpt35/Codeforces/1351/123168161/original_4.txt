Analysis:

The given code takes an integer `t` as input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it takes four integers `a1`, `b1`, `a2`, and `b2` as input. It then checks if the maximum of `a1` and `b1` is equal to the maximum of `a2` and `b2`, and if the sum of the minimums of `a1` and `b1` and the minimums of `a2` and `b2` is equal to the maximum. If both conditions are true, it prints "YES", otherwise it prints "NO".

Optimization Strategy:

1. Avoid unnecessary header inclusion: The code includes the entire `<bits/stdc++.h>` header, which is not recommended. We can replace it with the necessary headers `iostream` and `algorithm`.

2. Simplify the condition: The condition `max1 == max2 && min(a1, b1) + min(a2, b2) == max1` can be simplified to `max(a1, b1) == max(a2, b2)` because if the maximum of one pair is equal to the maximum of another pair, then their minimum sums will also be equal.

3. Avoid unnecessary variable assignments: The variables `max1` and `max2` are assigned the maximum values, but they are not used anywhere else in the code. We can directly use the `max()` function in the condition.

4. Use `'\n'` instead of `endl`: The use of `endl` flushes the output stream, which can be expensive. We can use `'\n'` instead, which only inserts a newline character.

5. Use a more efficient input method: The code currently uses `cin` to read the input values. However, `cin` is slower than other input methods like `scanf` or `fgets`. We can use `scanf` to read the input values for better performance.

Optimized Code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int t;
  scanf("%d", &t);
  while (t--) {
    int a1, b1, a2, b2;
    scanf("%d%d%d%d", &a1, &b1, &a2, &b2);
    if (max(a1, b1) == max(a2, b2))
      cout << "YES\n";
    else
      cout << "NO\n";
  }
  return 0;
}
```

By implementing these optimizations, the code will have improved performance and reduced memory usage compared to the original code.
