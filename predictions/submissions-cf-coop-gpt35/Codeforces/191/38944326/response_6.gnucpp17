The given code appears to be solving a graph problem. It calculates the number of paths between two nodes in a tree-like graph structure. The code uses multiple functions and data structures to perform the calculations.

Upon analyzing the code, I have identified several potential areas for optimization:

1. Redundant Data Structures: The code uses an `unordered_map` of `unordered_maps` to store the results, which is not efficient in terms of memory usage. We can optimize this by using a simple 2D array to store the results.

2. Inefficient Memory Usage: The code uses multiple arrays of size `N`, where `N` is a constant value. However, the actual size of the arrays depends on the input size `n`. We can optimize memory usage by dynamically allocating memory based on the input size.

3. Inefficient Looping: The code uses multiple loops to iterate over the edges and calculate the results. We can optimize these loops by using range-based loops, which are generally more efficient.

4. Unnecessary Data Manipulation: The code performs unnecessary swaps and unnecessary calculations on the input values. We can optimize this by removing these unnecessary operations.

5. Inefficient I/O Operations: The code uses `scanf` and `printf` for input and output operations, respectively. These functions can be slow for large inputs and outputs. We can optimize this by using faster I/O functions such as `cin` and `cout`.

Based on these observations, I propose the following optimization strategy:

1. Replace the `unordered_map` of `unordered_maps` with a 2D array to store the results.

2. Dynamically allocate memory for arrays based on the input size `n`.

3. Replace the loops with range-based loops where applicable.

4. Remove unnecessary swaps and calculations on the input values.

5. Replace `scanf` and `printf` with `cin` and `cout` for input and output operations, respectively.
