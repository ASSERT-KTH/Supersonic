The provided code calculates the sum of integers from 1 to n. If n is even, the sum is simply n/2, and if n is odd, the sum is (-1) times the ceil value of n/2. 

However, the code can be optimized to improve performance and reduce memory usage. Here are the steps to optimize the code:

1. Remove unnecessary header files: The code includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header, which is not necessary for this program. We can remove it.

2. Remove unnecessary variable declaration: The variable `sum` can be declared and initialized in the same line, as it is not required to have a separate line for initialization.

3. Remove the if-else condition: Instead of using an if-else condition to calculate the sum, we can use a single formula that works for both even and odd numbers. The sum of integers from 1 to n can be calculated as `(n * (n + 1))/2`. This formula works for all integers, whether they are even or odd.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  long long n;
  std::cin >> n;

  long long sum = (n * (n + 1))/2;

  std::cout << sum << std::endl;
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized code eliminates the need for conditional statements and simplifies the calculation by using a single formula. It reduces the number of instructions and improves performance.

The trade-off in this optimization is that the code becomes less readable for someone who is not familiar with the formula for calculating the sum of integers. However, the improved performance and reduced memory usage outweigh the slight decrease in readability.
