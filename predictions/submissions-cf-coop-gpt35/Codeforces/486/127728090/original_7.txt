The provided code calculates the sum of integers from 1 to n and prints the result. However, there are several areas where the code can be optimized for improved performance and reduced memory usage. Let's go through each step of the optimization process.

1. Code Analysis:
   - The code uses the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header, which includes a large number of unnecessary headers. We can replace it with the specific headers we need to reduce compilation time and memory usage.
   - The code uses a `long long` data type for n and sum. However, for the given problem, we can use an `int` data type as the sum of integers from 1 to n will always fit in the range of an `int`.
   - The code performs unnecessary calculations. Instead of using a conditional statement to calculate the sum, we can simplify the logic to calculate the sum directly based on the value of n.

2. Optimization Strategy:
   - Replace the `<bits/stdc++.h>` with the specific headers `iostream` and `cstdlib`.
   - Change the data type of n and sum from `long long` to `int`.
   - Simplify the logic to calculate the sum of integers from 1 to n.

3. Step-by-Step Explanation:
   1. Remove the line `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` and add `#include <iostream>` and `#include <cstdlib>`.
   2. Change the data type of n and sum from `long long` to `int`.
   3. Simplify the logic to calculate the sum of integers from 1 to n. Instead of using a conditional statement, we can directly calculate the sum using the formula `sum = (n * (n + 1)) / 2`.
   4. Update the output format from `cout << sum << endl;` to `std::cout << sum << std::endl;`.

4. Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cstdlib>

int main() {
  int n, sum;
  std::cin >> n;
  sum = (n * (n + 1)) / 2;
  std::cout << sum << std::endl;
  return 0;
}
```

The optimized code simplifies the logic to calculate the sum of integers from 1 to n and removes unnecessary data type and header includes, resulting in improved performance and reduced memory usage.
