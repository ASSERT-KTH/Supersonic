Code Analysis:
The given code calculates the sum of the first n integers. If n is even, it calculates the sum as n/2. If n is odd, it calculates the sum as ((n+1)/2) * (-1). The code uses a long long data type for the variables n and sum.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Avoid unnecessary calculations:
   - The code currently performs two divisions, one addition, and one multiplication to calculate the sum.
   - We can optimize this by avoiding the division and multiplication operations and directly calculating the sum based on the value of n.

2. Use a more appropriate data type:
   - The code uses a long long data type for the variables n and sum, which may be unnecessary for the given task.
   - We can use a more appropriate data type that can represent the range of values for n and sum.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Avoid unnecessary calculations:
   - Instead of using a conditional statement to determine whether n is even or odd, we can directly calculate the sum based on the value of n.
   - If n is even, the sum is n/2. If n is odd, the sum is -(n/2).
   - This avoids the need for the additional division and multiplication operations.

2. Use a more appropriate data type:
   - Since we are only calculating the sum of the first n integers, the sum will always be an integer.
   - We can use an int data type instead of a long long data type for the sum variable.
