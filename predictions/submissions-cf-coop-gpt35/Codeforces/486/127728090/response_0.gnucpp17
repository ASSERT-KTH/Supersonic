Analysis:
The given code calculates the sum of the first n integers with a time complexity of O(1). However, there are a few areas where the code can be optimized:

1. Unnecessary inclusion of the entire "bits/stdc++.h" library. This library includes a large number of headers, which can lead to longer compilation times and increased memory usage. Since the code only uses the "iostream" header, it is unnecessary to include the entire library.

2. Redundant variable declaration and assignment. The variable "sum" is assigned a value based on the condition n % 2 == 0. However, this condition is not needed, as the value of n / 2 will be the same for both even and odd values of n. Therefore, the if-else condition and the assignment to "sum" can be simplified.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Remove unnecessary inclusion of the "bits/stdc++.h" library and include only the "iostream" header.
2. Simplify the calculation of the sum by removing the if-else condition and directly assigning the value of n / 2 to "sum".

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Remove the line "#include <bits/stdc++.h>" and replace it with "#include <iostream>" to include only the necessary header.
2. Remove the if-else condition and directly assign the value of n / 2 to the variable "sum".
