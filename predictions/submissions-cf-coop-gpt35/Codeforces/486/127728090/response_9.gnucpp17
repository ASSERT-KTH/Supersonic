The given code calculates the sum of integers from 1 to n. If n is even, it calculates the sum directly by dividing n by 2. If n is odd, it calculates the sum by first incrementing n by 1, dividing the result by 2, and then multiplying it by -1.

While the code is correct and produces the expected output, there are several potential areas for optimization:

1. The code includes unnecessary header files. The `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` statement is not needed and can be replaced with specific header files that are actually required.

2. The code uses a `long long` data type for the variables `n` and `sum`. Since the sum of integers from 1 to n can be represented by an `int` data type, using `int` instead of `long long` will save memory.

3. The code uses an if-else statement to calculate the sum. A more efficient approach would be to use a single formula that works for both even and odd values of n.

4. The code uses the `cout` statement to print the sum. This can be replaced with a more efficient method, such as using `printf` or `puts` from the C standard library.
