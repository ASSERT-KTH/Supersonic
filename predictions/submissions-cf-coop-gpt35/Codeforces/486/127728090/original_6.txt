Analysis:
The given code is a simple program that takes an integer input, performs a calculation, and then outputs the result. The calculation is based on whether the input number is even or odd. If it is even, the result is n/2. If it is odd, the result is ((n+1)/2) * (-1).

Potential optimizations:
1. Unnecessary use of the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header: This header includes many standard C++ libraries, which may not be needed for this specific program. We can replace it with the specific headers that are actually required (`<iostream>` and `<cmath>`).

2. Redundant parentheses in the else branch: The parentheses around `n + 1` in the else branch are unnecessary. We can remove them to simplify the expression.

3. Repeated division and multiplication: The calculation in the else branch can be simplified to `-(n / 2)`. This removes the need for addition and division, resulting in a faster computation.

4. Use of long long for the variable type: The given code uses `long long` for the variable `n`. However, `long long` is not necessary for this program since the input is read as an `int` and the calculation involves only integer operations. We can replace `long long` with `int` to save memory.

Optimization strategy:
1. Replace the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header with the specific headers `<iostream>` and `<cmath>`.

2. Remove the unnecessary parentheses in the else branch.

3. Simplify the calculation in the else branch to `-(n / 2)`.

4. Replace `long long` with `int` for the variable `n`.

Step-by-Step Explanation:

Step 1: Replace the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header with the specific headers `<iostream>` and `<cmath>`. Since the code only uses `iostream` for input/output and does not use any math functions, we can remove the `<cmath>` header.

Step 2: Remove the unnecessary parentheses in the else branch. The expression `((n + 1) / 2) * (-1)` can be simplified to `(n / 2) * (-1)`.

Step 3: Simplify the calculation in the else branch to `-(n / 2)`. This removes the need for addition and division, resulting in a faster computation.

Step 4: Replace `long long` with `int` for the variable `n`. Since the input is read as an `int` and the calculation involves only integer operations, using `int` is sufficient and saves memory.

Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int n, sum;
  cin >> n;
  if (n % 2 == 0) {
    sum = n / 2;
  } else {
    sum = -(n / 2);
  }
  cout << sum << endl;
  return 0;
}
```
