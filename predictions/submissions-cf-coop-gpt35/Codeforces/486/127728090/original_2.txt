Upon analyzing the provided code, I have identified a few areas that can be optimized for efficiency:

1. Unnecessary inclusion: The code includes the entire `bits/stdc++.h` header, which is not necessary for this program. We can remove it and only include the required headers, such as `<iostream>`.

2. Redundant computation: The computation of the `sum` variable can be simplified. Currently, if `n` is even, `sum` is set to `n / 2`, and if `n` is odd, `sum` is set to `((n + 1) / 2) * (-1)`. We can optimize this by using the ternary operator `?:` to directly compute `sum` based on the parity of `n`. 

3. Data type: The program uses a `long long` data type for `n` and `sum`. However, since `n` is read from the input as a regular `int`, we can safely change the data type of `n` and `sum` to `int`.

Based on these observations, I will now provide an optimized version of the code along with an explanation of each optimization step.
