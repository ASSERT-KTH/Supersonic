Code Analysis:

1. The code reads input values for `n` and `k`, and two arrays `a` and `b` of size `n`.
2. It then defines a function `check` that takes a long long integer `x` as input and performs some computations.
3. The main function initializes variables `l` and `r` to 0 and `INF64` respectively.
4. It then enters a while loop that continues until `l` is less than `r-1`.
5. Inside the while loop, it calculates the midpoint `m` as `(l + r) / 2`, and calls the `check` function with `m` as the input.
6. If `check(m)` returns true, it updates `r` to `m`, otherwise it updates `l` to `m`.
7. Finally, it checks if `check(r)` returns false, and prints the result accordingly.

Potential Optimizations:

1. Memory Usage: The code uses several arrays and vectors to store information. We can try to optimize memory usage by reducing the size of these data structures or using more efficient alternatives.

2. Loop Optimization: The code contains multiple loops that can potentially be optimized for better performance. We can analyze these loops and consider techniques like loop unrolling to improve execution speed.

3. Redundant Computations: The `check` function performs some redundant computations that can be eliminated to improve efficiency.

4. Compiler Optimizations: We can suggest compiler optimizations or pragma directives that can help the compiler optimize the code more effectively.

Optimization Steps:

1. Memory Usage Optimization:
   - The `cur` array is used to store the remainder of `a[i]` divided by `b[i]`. Since the array only needs to store values between 0 and `b[i] - 1`, we can change the data type of `cur` from `long long` to `int` to save memory.
   - The `qr` vector is used to store indices of elements in `cur` for each value of `t`. Instead of using a vector, we can use a fixed-size array with a maximum size of `n` to store these indices. This will reduce memory allocation and deallocation overhead.

2. Loop Optimization:
   - The `check` function has nested loops that iterate over `n` and `k`. We can try to optimize these loops using techniques like loop unrolling or loop interchange to improve performance. However, since the loop structure is complex, we need to carefully analyze the code and identify the most suitable optimization strategy.

3. Redundant Computations:
   - In the `check` function, the expression `cur[i] + x` is computed multiple times. We can store this value in a temporary variable and reuse it instead of recomputing it each time.

4. Compiler Optimizations:
   - We can suggest enabling compiler optimizations using appropriate compiler flags or pragma directives. This will allow the compiler to apply various optimization techniques like loop unrolling, constant propagation, and function inlining to improve the performance of the code.
