1. Code Analysis:
   - The code calculates the minimum value `x` such that for every `i` in the range [0, n-1], the sum `a[i] + x * b[i]` is divisible by `k`.
   - The function `check` checks if a given value `x` satisfies the condition.
   - The code uses an array `cur` to keep track of the current remainder `cur[i]` when `a[i]` is divided by `b[i]`.
   - The code uses a vector of vectors `qr` to store the indices of the elements that have the same remainder `t` when divided by `k`.
   - The code uses binary search to find the minimum value `x` that satisfies the condition.

2. Optimization Strategy:
   1. Use a more efficient data structure to store the indices of elements with the same remainder.
   2. Avoid unnecessary computations by reducing the number of divisions and modulus operations.
   3. Optimize the binary search by using a more efficient termination condition.
   4. Use compiler optimizations to improve the performance of the code.

3. Step-by-Step Explanation:
   1. Replace the vector of vectors `qr` with a single vector `qr` of size `k` to store the indices of elements with the same remainder. Initialize `qr` with an empty vector for each index.
      - This optimization reduces memory usage and improves cache efficiency.
      - The trade-off is increased code complexity as we need to access `qr[t]` instead of `qr[lst]`.
   2. Instead of calculating `t = cur[i] / b[i] + 1` and then calculating `cur[i] %= b[i]`, calculate `t = (cur[i] + b[i] - 1) / b[i]` and update `cur[i]` directly as `cur[i] -= t * b[i]`.
      - This optimization eliminates the need for the division operation and reduces the number of modulus operations.
      - The trade-off is increased code complexity and a small increase in the number of arithmetic operations.
   3. Optimize the binary search by using a more efficient termination condition. Instead of `while (l < r - 1)`, use `while (l + 1 < r)` to terminate the loop when there are only two possible values left.
      - This optimization reduces the number of iterations in the binary search.
   4. Use compiler optimizations, such as `-O3` or `-Ofast`, to enable aggressive optimizations by the compiler.
      - Compiler optimizations can improve the performance of the code without any code changes.
      - The trade-off is increased compilation time and potentially more complex debugging.
