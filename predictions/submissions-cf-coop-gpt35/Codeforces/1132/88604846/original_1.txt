The given code is an implementation of a binary search algorithm to find the minimum value `x` such that `check(x)` returns true. The `check()` function checks whether it is possible to distribute the values `a[i]` among `k` buckets such that the sum of the remainders of `a[i]` divided by `b[i]` is less than or equal to `x` for all `i`.

While the code is correct and produces the correct output, there are several areas that can be optimized for better performance and reduced memory usage.

1. Unnecessary `#include` and `using` directives:
   - The code includes the entire `bits/stdc++.h` header, which is not recommended as it includes many unnecessary headers and can slow down the compilation process. Instead, only the necessary headers should be included.
   - The `using namespace std` directive imports the entire `std` namespace, which can lead to name clashes and make the code less readable. It is better to use the `std::` prefix for standard library functions and objects.

2. Excessive use of global variables:
   - The variables `n`, `k`, `a`, `b`, and `cur` are declared as global variables. It is generally better to limit the scope of variables to where they are actually used. This can improve code readability and reduce the chance of introducing bugs.

3. Redundant calculations:
   - In the `check()` function, the remainder `cur[i]` is calculated twice: once in the line `cur[i] %= b[i]`, and again in the line `if (cur[i] + x < b[i])`. The remainder can be calculated once and stored in a separate variable to avoid redundant calculations.

4. Inefficient data structure:
   - The `vector<int> qr[N]` array is used to store indices of values that need to be distributed to the next bucket. However, vector operations like `push_back()` and `pop_back()` have linear time complexity in the worst case. Using a more efficient data structure, such as a deque or a linked list, can improve the performance of these operations.

5. Inefficient binary search loop:
   - The binary search loop in the `main()` function uses the condition `while (l < r - 1)`, which can result in unnecessary iterations. It is more efficient to use the condition `while (l + 1 < r)` to terminate the loop when the search interval has narrowed down to two adjacent values.

Based on these observations, the following optimization steps can be taken:

Step 1: Remove unnecessary `#include` and `using` directives:
- Remove the `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` directive.
- Replace `using namespace std` with the `std::` prefix for standard library functions and objects.

Step 2: Move global variables to local scope:
- Move the variables `n`, `k`, `a`, `b`, and `cur` from global scope to the `main()` function.

Step 3: Calculate remainder `cur[i]` only once:
- Store the remainder `cur[i]` in a separate variable before calculating the value of `t`.

Step 4: Use a more efficient data structure:
- Replace `vector<int> qr[N]` with a more efficient data structure like `std::deque<int> qr[N]` or `std::list<int> qr[N]`.

Step 5: Optimize the binary search loop:
- Change the condition in the binary search loop to `while (l + 1 < r)`.

Here is the optimized code with these changes implemented:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <deque>
#include <list>

const int N = 200 * 1000 + 13;
const long long INF64 = 1e18;

bool check(long long x, int n, int k, const std::vector<long long>& a, const std::vector<int>& b) {
  std::deque<int> qr[N];
  std::vector<long long> cur(a.begin(), a.end());

  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    long long t = cur[i] / b[i] + 1;
    long long remainder = cur[i] % b[i];
    if (t < k)
      qr[t].push_back(i);
    cur[i] = remainder;
  }

  int lst = 0;
  for (int t = 0; t < k; t++) {
    while (lst < k && qr[lst].empty())
      ++lst;
    if (lst <= t)
      return false;
    if (lst == k)
      return true;
    int i = qr[lst].back();
    if (cur[i] + x < b[i]) {
      cur[i] += x;
      continue;
    }
    qr[lst].pop_back();
    long long nt = (cur[i] + x) / b[i];
    cur[i] = (cur[i] + x) % b[i];
    if (lst + nt < k)
      qr[lst + nt].push_back(i);
  }

  return true;
}

int main() {
  int n, k;
  std::cin >> n >> k;

  std::vector<long long> a(n);
  std::vector<int> b(n);

  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    std::cin >> a[i];

  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    std::cin >> b[i];

  long long l = 0, r = INF64;
  while (l + 1 < r) {
    long long m = (l + r) / 2;
    if (check(m, n, k, a, b))
      r = m;
    else
      l = m;
  }

  if (!check(r, n, k, a, b))
    std::cout << "-1\n";
  else
    std::cout << (check(l, n, k, a, b) ? l : r) << "\n";

  return 0;
}
```

These optimization steps aim to improve the code's performance and reduce memory usage, while preserving the functionality and output of the original code.
