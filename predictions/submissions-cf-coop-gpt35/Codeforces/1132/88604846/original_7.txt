Code Analysis:
1. The code defines a macro `forn(i, n)` which is used to iterate over a range of values from 0 to n-1.
2. The code includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header file, which is not recommended as it includes a large number of unnecessary headers and can slow down the compilation process.
3. The code uses a fixed-size array `a` and `b`, which limits the maximum number of elements that can be processed. It also uses a fixed-size array `cur`, which is unnecessary as its size is the same as `a`.
4. The code uses vectors `qr` to store indices of elements that need to be processed. However, the vectors are cleared and reinitialized in every iteration, which is inefficient.
5. The `check` function iterates over the values of `t` and `lst` in nested loops, which can be optimized.
6. The main loop uses binary search to find the minimum value of `m` such that `check(m)` returns true.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Replace the macro `forn(i, n)` with a regular `for` loop to improve code readability.
2. Replace the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header with the necessary standard library headers.
3. Use `std::vector` instead of fixed-size arrays `a`, `b`, and `cur` to allow for variable-sized inputs.
4. Instead of clearing and reinitializing the `qr` vectors in every iteration, initialize them once outside the loop and use an index variable to keep track of the last non-empty vector.
5. Optimize the `check` function by reducing the number of iterations and removing unnecessary calculations.
6. Replace the binary search loop with a more efficient approach.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Replace the macro `forn(i, n)` with a regular `for` loop to improve code readability and avoid any potential issues with macros.
2. Replace the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header with the necessary standard library headers (e.g., `<iostream>`, `<vector>`, `<algorithm>`).
3. Replace the fixed-size arrays `a`, `b`, and `cur` with `std::vector` to allow for variable-sized inputs. This will also eliminate the need for the `N` constant.
4. Move the initialization of `qr` vectors outside the `check` function and create an index variable `lastNonEmpty` to keep track of the last non-empty vector. This will avoid clearing and reinitializing the vectors in every iteration.
5. Optimize the `check` function:
   a. Replace the nested loops with a single loop that iterates over the values of `t` and `lst`.
   b. Replace the `if (t < k)` check with `if (lst < k)` to eliminate unnecessary iterations.
   c. Replace the `if (cur[i] + x < b[i])` check with `if (x < b[i] - cur[i])` to avoid unnecessary calculations.
   d. Replace the `nt` variable with `(cur[i] + x) / b[i] - 1` to reduce the number of calculations.
   e. Use `pop_back()` instead of `erase()` to remove the last element from the vector, as it is more efficient for removing a single element.
6. Replace the binary search loop with a more efficient approach using a `while` loop and two pointers `l` and `r`. This will find the minimum value of `m` such that `check(m)` returns true.
7. Replace the `printf` and `scanf` functions with `std::cout` and `std::cin` for input/output operations.

    long long l = 0, r = INF64;
    
    while (l < r - 1) {
        long long m = (l + r) / 2;
        if (check(m, a, b, k))
            r = m;
        else
            l = m;

    if (!check(r, a, b, k))
        std::cout << -1 << std::endl;
    else
        std::cout << (check(l, a, b, k) ? l : r) << std::endl;
