Upon analyzing the given code, I have identified a few potential areas for optimization:

1. Input/Output Optimization: The code is using `cin` and `cout` for input and output operations respectively. These operations are generally slower compared to other input/output methods. I would suggest using `scanf` and `printf` functions instead.

2. Sorting: The code uses the `sort` function to sort the vector `a`. The `sort` function has an average time complexity of O(nlogn). Since the vector `a` is already sorted, we can avoid the sorting step altogether.

3. Memory Allocation: The code uses a vector `a` to store the input values. However, the vector is initialized with a size of `n + 1`, which is unnecessary as only `n` elements are actually used.

4. Loop Optimization: The code uses a for loop to iterate through the vector `a` after sorting. This loop can be optimized by removing the subtraction operation and using a single variable to store the cumulative sum.

Based on these observations, here is the step-by-step optimization approach:

Step 1: Replace the `fast` macro with the necessary input/output optimizations.

Step 2: Remove the sorting step as the vector `a` is already sorted.

Step 3: Correct the size of the vector `a` to `n` instead of `n + 1`.

Step 4: Optimize the loop that calculates the cumulative sum by removing the subtraction operation and using a single variable.
