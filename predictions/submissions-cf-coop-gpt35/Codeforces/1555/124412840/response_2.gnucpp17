The provided code calculates the minimum number of changes required in a substring of a given string to convert it into one of the six patterns: "abc", "acb", "bac", "bca", "cab", or "cba". It does this by pre-calculating an array `pp` which stores the cumulative number of changes required for each pattern at every position in the string. Then, for each query, it calculates the minimum number of changes required using the pre-calculated array.

However, there are several optimizations that can be made to improve the efficiency of this code:

1. Avoid unnecessary memory usage: The array `k` is used to store the six patterns. Instead of using a 2D character array, we can use a 1D array of strings. This will reduce the memory usage and improve cache locality.

2. Use a more efficient data structure for `pp`: The current implementation uses a 2D array `pp` to store the cumulative number of changes required for each pattern at every position in the string. This can be optimized by using a 1D array `pp` with size `6 * (n + 1)`. This will reduce the memory usage and improve cache locality.

3. Avoid redundant computations: The current implementation checks for a pattern mismatch at each position in the string. However, we can optimize this by calculating the number of changes required for each pattern at each position using a single loop. This will reduce the number of iterations and improve performance.

4. Use compiler optimizations: Adding the `#pragma GCC optimize(2)` directive can enable compiler optimizations, such as loop unrolling and inline expansion, which can improve the performance of the code.
