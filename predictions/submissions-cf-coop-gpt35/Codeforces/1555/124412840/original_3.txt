Code Analysis:
- The code reads an integer 'n' and 'm' from the input, and then reads a string 's' of length 'n'.
- It initializes an array 'k' with 6 strings.
- It initializes a 2D array 'pp' of size 6x(n+1) and sets all elements to 0.
- It then computes the prefix sums of the number of characters that need to be changed for each string in 'k' to match the substring of 's' of length 'j'.
- Finally, it reads 'm' queries and for each query, it computes the minimum number of characters that need to be changed in the substring of 's' from index 'l' to index 'r' for each string in 'k', and outputs the minimum value.

Potential optimizations:
1. Avoid using the `bits/stdc++.h` header, which includes unnecessary standard library headers. Instead, include only the necessary headers.
2. Remove the `#pragma GCC optimize(2)` directive, as it may lead to unintended consequences and is not necessary for this code.
3. Avoid using `std::endl` for line breaks in the output, as it flushes the output buffer and can significantly slow down the program.
4. Use more efficient data structures to store the prefix sums. The current implementation uses a 2D array, which is not necessary. A 1D array or a vector would be sufficient.
5. Reduce the number of unnecessary comparisons by checking if the substring of 's' has changed before updating the prefix sums.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Remove unnecessary headers and directives.
2. Replace the 2D array 'pp' with a 1D vector to store the prefix sums.
3. Avoid unnecessary comparisons by checking if the substring of 's' has changed before updating the prefix sums.
4. Replace the use of `std::endl` with the newline character '\n' for line breaks in the output.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Remove the unnecessary headers and directives:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <vector>
```

2. Replace the 2D array 'pp' with a 1D vector to store the prefix sums:
```cpp
std::vector<int> pp(6, 0);
```

3. Avoid unnecessary comparisons by checking if the substring of 's' has changed before updating the prefix sums:
```cpp
for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
  for (int i = 0; i < 6; i++) {
    pp[i] += (k[i][j % 3] != s[j]);
  }
}
```

4. Replace the use of `std::endl` with the newline character '\n' for line breaks in the output:
```cpp
std::cout << ans << '\n';
```

Optimized Code Block:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <vector>

int main() {
  std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  std::cin.tie(NULL);

  int n, m;
  std::cin >> n >> m;

  std::string s;
  std::cin >> s;

  std::string k[6] = {"abc", "acb", "bac", "bca", "cab", "cba"};
  std::vector<int> pp(6, 0);

  for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
    for (int i = 0; i < 6; i++) {
      pp[i] += (k[i][j % 3] != s[j]);
    }
  }

  while (m--) {
    int l, r;
    std::cin >> l >> r;
    l--;

    int ans = r - l;

    for (int i = 0; i < 6; i++) {
      ans = std::min(ans, pp[i][r] - pp[i][l]);
    }

    std::cout << ans << '\n';
  }

  return 0;
}
```
