Code Analysis:
- The code is using a segment tree to perform range updates and minimum value queries.
- The segment tree is implemented using an array `t` of size `4*N` and an array `push` of size `4*N` to store the lazy updates.
- The `makepush` function is used to propagate the lazy updates down the tree.
- The `add` function is used to perform range updates.
- The main logic of the code is to sort the input ranges by their weights and then iterate over them to find the minimum weight difference between two disjoint ranges.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Use a more memory-efficient data structure for the segment tree:
   - The current implementation uses an array of size `4*N` to store the segment tree.
   - Instead, we can use a dynamically allocated array to save memory.
   - We can allocate the array of size `N` and use a pointer to traverse the tree instead of array indices.
   - This will reduce the memory usage from `4*N` to `N` and improve cache locality.

2. Avoid unnecessary function calls:
   - The `makepush` function is called recursively for each node, even if it doesn't have any pending updates.
   - We can optimize this by only calling `makepush` when necessary, i.e., when `push[v]` is non-zero.

3. Use prefix sum optimization:
   - The current implementation updates each node in the segment tree individually.
   - We can optimize this by using a prefix sum approach.
   - Instead of updating each node individually, we can update a range of nodes in a single operation.
   - This will reduce the number of function calls and improve performance.

4. Optimize the sorting:
   - The code currently sorts the input ranges using a lambda function as the sorting criteria.
   - We can optimize the sorting by using a custom comparator function instead of a lambda function.
   - This will reduce the overhead of creating and invoking the lambda function for each comparison.
