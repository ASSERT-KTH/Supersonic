The given code seems to correctly solve the problem at hand, but there are several areas where it can be optimized for better performance and memory usage. Let's go through each optimization step.

1. Avoid unnecessary includes:
   The code includes both `<bits/stdc++.h>` and `<iostream>`, but only the latter is being used. We can remove the unnecessary include to improve compile time.

2. Avoid unnecessary variable initialization:
   The variable `test` is initialized to 1 before reading its value from input. We can remove this unnecessary initialization.

3. Avoid unnecessary memory allocation:
   The matrix `vector<vector<int>> matrix(2, vector<int>(m))` is allocated with a size of 2xM, but only the first row is used for input. We can change the matrix size to 1xM to save memory.

4. Avoid unnecessary vector resizing:
   The matrix `vector<vector<int>>` is resized to 2xM initially, but only the first row is used. We can remove the resizing operation and directly assign values to the first row.

5. Avoid unnecessary loop iterations:
   The loop `for (int j = 1; j < m; j++)` iterates from 1 to M-1, but the first iteration is not necessary for the calculation. We can start the loop from j=2 instead.

6. Avoid unnecessary calculation of suffix:
   The variable `suffix` is being calculated using `suffix += matrix[0][j]` in each iteration of the loop. We can calculate it once before the loop and then subtract matrix[0][j] in each iteration.

7. Avoid unnecessary calculation of prefix:
   The variable `prefix` is being calculated using `prefix += matrix[1][j - 1]` in each iteration of the loop. We can calculate it once before the loop and then add matrix[1][j] in each iteration.

8. Use a more efficient data type:
   The data type `ll` (long long int) is used for variables `suffix`, `prefix`, and `ans`. We can use `int` instead, as the problem constraints suggest that the values will not exceed the range of an `int`.
