Analysis:
- The code reads an integer `n` from input.
- It then reads `n` integers from input and checks if any of them is equal to 1.
- If any of the integers is equal to 1, it prints "HARD" and exits the program.
- If none of the integers is equal to 1, it prints "EASY" and exits the program.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Remove the unnecessary `using namespace std;` directive.
2. Use `std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);` to disable synchronization between C and C++ standard streams, which can improve the performance of input and output operations.
3. Instead of reading and checking each integer one by one, we can optimize the loop by reading the integers in a more efficient way.
4. Replace `cout` with `printf` for faster output.
5. Add comments to highlight the optimizations made.

Optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cstdio>

int main() {
  std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  int n;
  std::cin >> n;

  // Read the integers and check if any of them is equal to 1
  bool hard = false;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    int a;
    std::cin >> a;
    hard |= (a == 1); // Use bitwise OR to check if any of the integers is equal to 1
  }

  // Output the result
  if (hard) {
    printf("HARD\n");
  } else {
    printf("EASY\n");
  }

  return 0;
}
```

Explanation:
1. The `using namespace std;` directive is removed to avoid polluting the global namespace.
2. `std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);` is used to disable synchronization between C and C++ standard streams, which can improve the performance of input and output operations.
3. Instead of using `cout` for output, `printf` is used, which is generally faster.
4. The loop is optimized by reading and checking the integers in a more efficient way. Instead of using an if statement inside the loop, a bitwise OR operation is used to check if any of the integers is equal to 1. This reduces the number of conditional branches and improves performance.
5. Comments are added to explain the optimizations made and improve code readability.
