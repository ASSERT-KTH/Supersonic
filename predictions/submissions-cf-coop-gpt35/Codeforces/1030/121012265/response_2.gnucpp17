The given code appears to be a simple program that takes an integer `n` as input, followed by `n` integers. It checks if any of the integers is equal to 1, and if so, outputs "HARD". Otherwise, it outputs "EASY". 

To optimize this code, we can make a few improvements:

1. Remove unnecessary headers: The code includes `<string>` header, which is not required. We can remove it.

2. Avoid using `using namespace std;`: This statement brings all the names in the `std` namespace into the current scope, which can lead to naming collisions. It's better to explicitly use the `std::` prefix where needed.

3. Disable synchronization with C I/O functions: The statement `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);` is used to disable the synchronization between C and C++ standard streams. However, in this code, it is not necessary as we are not mixing C and C++ input/output operations.

4. Optimize input/output operations: The code uses `std::cin` and `std::cout` for input and output. These operations are slower compared to C-style input/output functions. We can improve the performance by using C-style `scanf` and `printf` functions instead.

5. Remove unnecessary return statement: The `return 0;` statement after printing "HARD" is unnecessary as the program will terminate after that. We can remove it.
