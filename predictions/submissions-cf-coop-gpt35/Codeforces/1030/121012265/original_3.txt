Code Analysis:
The given code is a simple program that takes an integer input, followed by a series of integers. It checks if any of the integers is equal to 1. If it finds a 1, it outputs "HARD", otherwise it outputs "EASY".

The code has a few performance bottlenecks and inefficiencies that can be optimized:
1. The line `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);` is unnecessary and can be removed.
2. The code uses the `cin` and `cout` streams for input and output. These streams are slower compared to other input/output methods, such as `scanf` and `printf`, especially when dealing with large inputs. Therefore, we can optimize the code by replacing the input/output streams.
3. The code uses a simple loop to iterate over the input integers and check if any of them is equal to 1. This approach has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of integers. We can optimize this by using a more efficient data structure or algorithm to reduce the time complexity.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Remove the line `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);` as it is not necessary.
2. Replace the input and output streams (`cin` and `cout`) with `scanf` and `printf`, respectively, for faster input/output operations.
3. Use a flag variable to keep track of whether the number 1 is found in the input. If we find a 1, we can immediately output "HARD" and terminate the program.
4. Use a `for` loop instead of a `while` loop for reading the input integers, as a `for` loop has a better performance compared to a `while` loop.
5. Use `scanf` instead of `cin` to read the input integers, as `scanf` is faster than `cin`.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Remove the line `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);` as it is not necessary for this code.

2. Replace the input and output streams (`cin` and `cout`) with `scanf` and `printf`, respectively, for faster input/output operations.

```cpp
#include <cstdio>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <cstring>

int main() {
  int n, a;
  scanf("%d", &n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    scanf("%d", &a);
    if (a == 1) {
      printf("HARD\n");
      return 0;
    }
  }
  printf("EASY\n");
  return 0;
}
```

3. Use a flag variable to keep track of whether the number 1 is found in the input. If we find a 1, we can immediately output "HARD" and terminate the program.

```cpp
#include <cstdio>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <cstring>

int main() {
  int n, a;
  bool isHard = false;
  scanf("%d", &n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    scanf("%d", &a);
    if (a == 1) {
      isHard = true;
      break;
    }
  }
  if (isHard) {
    printf("HARD\n");
  } else {
    printf("EASY\n");
  }
  return 0;
}
```

4. Use a `for` loop instead of a `while` loop for reading the input integers, as a `for` loop has a better performance compared to a `while` loop.

```cpp
#include <cstdio>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <cstring>

int main() {
  int n, a;
  bool isHard = false;
  scanf("%d", &n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    scanf("%d", &a);
    if (a == 1) {
      isHard = true;
      break;
    }
  }
  if (isHard) {
    printf("HARD\n");
  } else {
    printf("EASY\n");
  }
  return 0;
}
```

5. Use `scanf` instead of `cin` to read the input integers, as `scanf` is faster than `cin`.

```cpp
#include <cstdio>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <cstring>

int main() {
  int n, a;
  bool isHard = false;
  scanf("%d", &n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    scanf("%d", &a);
    if (a == 1) {
      isHard = true;
      break;
    }
  }
  if (isHard) {
    printf("HARD\n");
  } else {
    printf("EASY\n");
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Optimized Code:
```cpp
#include <cstdio>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <cstring>

int main() {
  int n, a;
  bool isHard = false;
  scanf("%d", &n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    scanf("%d", &a);
    if (a == 1) {
      isHard = true;
      break;
    }
  }
  if (isHard) {
    printf("HARD\n");
  } else {
    printf("EASY\n");
  }
  return 0;
}
```

The optimized code improves the performance of the original code by removing unnecessary operations and using faster input/output methods. It also reduces memory usage by replacing the unnecessary `iostream` library with the more efficient `cstdio` library. The optimized code has a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(1), where n is the number of integers in the input. The trade-off is a slightly more complex code due to the use of additional variables and the change in input/output methods, but the performance gain outweighs the increased complexity.
