The provided code seems simple and straightforward, but there are a few potential areas for optimization.

1. The `using namespace std;` directive brings all the names from the `std` namespace into the global namespace. While it is convenient for writing code, it can cause naming conflicts and increase compilation time. It is generally recommended to avoid using this directive in larger codebases.

2. The `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);` line disables the synchronization between C and C++ standard streams, potentially improving the performance of input/output operations. However, it is not necessary for this particular code since there are no mixed C and C++ input/output operations.

3. The code uses a `for` loop to iterate over the input and check if any element is equal to 1. If a 1 is found, the program prints "HARD" and exits the loop. Otherwise, it prints "EASY" after the loop. There is no need to continue the loop once a 1 is found. We can optimize the loop by using a `while` loop and breaking out of it when a 1 is encountered.

4. The code does not perform any memory-intensive operations, so there is no immediate need to optimize memory usage. However, we can still ensure efficient memory access by using appropriate data types and avoiding unnecessary allocations.
