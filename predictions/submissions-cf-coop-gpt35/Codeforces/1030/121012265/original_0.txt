Code Analysis:
- The code reads an integer `n` from the user, followed by `n` integers.
- It checks if any of the integers is equal to 1.
- If any of the integers is equal to 1, it prints "HARD" and exits.
- If none of the integers is equal to 1, it prints "EASY" and exits.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Avoid using `std::endl`: The code currently uses `std::endl` to output a newline character and flush the output stream. However, `std::endl` is slower than using `'\n'` directly because it forces the stream to flush. We can replace all instances of `std::endl` with `'\n'` to improve performance.

2. Avoid unnecessary `std::string` inclusion: The code includes the `<string>` header, but it does not use any string-related functionality. We can remove this unnecessary inclusion to improve compilation time.

3. Use a more efficient input method: The code uses `std::cin` for input. By default, `std::cin` is synchronized with `std::cout`, which can slow down input operations. We can improve input performance by disabling the synchronization using `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false)`.

4. Optimize the loop: The loop currently checks each integer individually and returns if it finds a 1. Instead, we can use a flag variable to track if a 1 is found. This can potentially reduce the number of iterations in the loop.

Optimized Code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  
  int n, a;
  std::cin >> n;

  bool foundOne = false;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    std::cin >> a;
    if (a == 1) {
      foundOne = true;
      break;
    }
  }

  if (foundOne) {
    std::cout << "HARD\n";
  } else {
    std::cout << "EASY\n";
  }

  return 0;
}
```

In this optimized version, we have made the following changes:
- Replaced `std::endl` with `'\n'` to avoid unnecessary flushing of the output stream.
- Removed the unnecessary inclusion of the `<string>` header.
- Disabled the synchronization between `std::cin` and `std::cout` for improved input performance.
- Added a flag variable `foundOne` to track whether a 1 is found, which allows us to break out of the loop early if necessary.

These changes improve the performance and memory usage of the code without altering its functionality. The optimized code is also more readable and maintainable.
