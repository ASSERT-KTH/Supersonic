Analysis:
The given code reads an integer n, followed by n integers. If any of the integers is equal to 1, it prints "HARD" and exits. Otherwise, it prints "EASY". The code seems simple and straightforward, but there are a few areas where we can optimize its performance.

1. I/O Optimization: The code includes `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false)`, which disables the synchronization between C and C++ I/O streams. This can improve the performance of I/O operations. However, in this specific code, there are no mixed C and C++ I/O operations, so we can safely remove this line.

2. Input/Output Functions: The code uses `cin` and `cout` for input and output operations. These functions are convenient to use but can be slower compared to other I/O functions like `scanf` and `printf`. We can replace `cin` and `cout` with `scanf` and `printf` to optimize the I/O operations.

3. Loop Unrolling: The code uses a simple for loop to iterate over the input integers. We can optimize this loop by unrolling it, which means manually expanding the loop to process multiple elements in each iteration. This can reduce the overhead of loop control and improve performance.

4. Compiler Optimization: We can suggest the compiler to optimize the code by enabling compiler optimizations. This can be achieved by using appropriate compiler flags or pragmas. Compiler optimizations can include loop unrolling, inline function expansion, and other optimizations specific to the target architecture.

Optimization Steps:
1. Remove `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false)` as it is not needed in this code.
2. Replace `cin` with `scanf` and `cout` with `printf` for faster I/O operations.
3. Unroll the loop that iterates over the input integers. Instead of reading one integer at a time, we can read multiple integers and process them together.
4. Enable compiler optimizations by using appropriate compiler flags or pragmas.
