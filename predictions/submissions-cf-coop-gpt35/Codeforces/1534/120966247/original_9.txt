The provided code calculates the power of 2 raised to the number of connected components in a graph. The graph is represented using an adjacency list `e[]`, where each element `e[i]` is a vector containing the adjacent nodes of node `i`. The code uses a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm to count the number of connected components in the graph.

Let's now analyze the code and identify potential areas for optimization.

1. Inefficient Memory Usage:
   - The arrays `a[]` and `vis[]` have a fixed size of 400005, which is not necessary for all test cases. This can lead to inefficient memory usage for smaller values of `n`.
   - The vector `e[]` also has a fixed size of 400005, which is not efficient for graphs with fewer nodes.

2. Redundant Computations:
   - The function `qmi()` calculates the power of 2 raised to `cnt` using the binary exponentiation method. However, the modulo operation `% N` is performed twice - once inside the loop and once after the loop. This is unnecessary and can be optimized.

3. Inefficient Loop:
   - The DFS function `dfs()` uses a loop to iterate over the adjacent nodes of a given node `u`. However, the loop condition `i < e[u].size()` is checked in every iteration, which can be optimized.

Based on this analysis, we can devise an optimization strategy:

1. Optimize Memory Usage:
   - Use dynamic memory allocation or a resizable container, such as `std::vector`, instead of fixed-size arrays `a[]` and `vis[]`.
   - Determine the actual number of nodes in the graph and allocate memory accordingly for `e[]`.

2. Optimize Power Calculation:
   - Remove the redundant modulo operation `% N` inside the `qmi()` function.

3. Optimize DFS Loop:
   - Cache the size of `e[u]` before the loop to avoid the overhead of evaluating it in each iteration.

Next, we will implement these optimizations step by step.

```cpp
#include <cstring>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;
#define int long long
const int N = 1e9 + 7;
int t, n, cnt;
int* a;
int* vis;
vector<int>* e;

void dfs(int u) {
  vis[u] = 1;
  int size = e[u].size();  // Cache size of e[u]
  for (int i = 0; i < size; ++i) {
    int v = e[u][i];
    if (!vis[v])
      dfs(v);
  }
}

int qmi(int cnt) {
  int x = 2, s = 1;
  while (cnt) {
    if (cnt & 1)
      s = s * x % N;
    x = x * x % N;
    cnt >>= 1;
  }
  return s;  // Remove modulo operation
}

signed main() {
  cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    cin >> n;
    cnt = 0;
    a = new int[n + 1];  // Use dynamic memory allocation
    vis = new int[n + 1];  // Use dynamic memory allocation
    e = new vector<int>[n + 1];  // Use dynamic memory allocation
    memset(vis, 0, sizeof(int) * (n + 1));
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
      cin >> a[i];
      e[i].clear();
    }
    for (int v, i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
      cin >> v;
      e[a[i]].push_back(v);
    }
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++)
      if (!vis[a[i]])
        cnt++, dfs(a[i]);
    cout << qmi(cnt) << endl;

    delete[] a;  // Deallocate memory
    delete[] vis;  // Deallocate memory
    delete[] e;  // Deallocate memory
  }
  return 0;
}
```

In this optimized code, we have made the following changes:

1. Replaced the fixed-size arrays `a[]` and `vis[]` with dynamically allocated memory using `new` operator. This allows us to allocate memory based on the actual number of nodes in the graph.
2. Replaced the fixed-size array `e[]` with a dynamically allocated array of vectors using `new` operator. This allows us to allocate memory based on the actual number of nodes in the graph.
3. Cached the size of `e[u]` before the loop in `dfs()` to avoid the overhead of evaluating it in each iteration.
4. Removed the redundant modulo operation `% N` inside the `qmi()` function.

These optimizations improve memory usage by allocating memory based on the actual number of nodes in the graph, and also reduce redundant computations by removing unnecessary modulo operations.

Please note that the `delete[]` operator is used to deallocate the dynamically allocated memory after each test case to avoid memory leaks.

Overall, these optimizations should improve the efficiency of the code by reducing memory usage and eliminating redundant computations.
