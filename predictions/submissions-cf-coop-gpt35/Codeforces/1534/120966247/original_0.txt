Code Analysis:

1. The code uses the `vector` container to store adjacency lists for each vertex in a graph. However, this can be inefficient in terms of memory usage and performance, especially for large graphs. 

2. The code uses a recursive depth-first search (DFS) algorithm to traverse the graph. While DFS is a common and effective algorithm for graph traversal, the recursive implementation can be inefficient for large graphs due to the function call overhead.

3. The code uses the `memset` function to initialize the `vis` array to zero. However, this can be replaced with a more efficient alternative.

4. The code uses the `qmi` function to calculate the modular exponentiation of a number. This function can be optimized to improve performance.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Use a more efficient data structure for storing the adjacency lists: Instead of using `vector`, we can use an array of linked lists to represent the graph. This will reduce the memory overhead and improve cache locality.

2. Replace the recursive DFS implementation with an iterative approach: By using a stack to simulate the function call stack, we can avoid the overhead of recursive function calls. This will improve the performance, especially for large graphs.

3. Replace `memset` with a more efficient alternative: Instead of using `memset` to initialize the `vis` array, we can use the `fill` algorithm from the `<algorithm>` library. This will improve code readability and potentially improve performance.

4. Optimize the `qmi` function: We can optimize the modular exponentiation calculation by using the binary exponentiation algorithm instead of the iterative approach. This will improve the performance of the function.

Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. Replace the `vector` container with an array of linked lists: Replace the declaration `vector<int> e[400005]` with `list<int> e[400005]`. This will reduce the memory overhead and improve cache locality.

2. Replace the recursive DFS implementation with an iterative approach: Define a stack to simulate the function call stack. Instead of the recursive call to `dfs(v)`, push `v` onto the stack. Inside the `while` loop, replace the recursive call `dfs(v)` with `u = v` and continue the loop. This will eliminate the recursive function call overhead.

3. Replace `memset` with `fill` algorithm: Replace the line `memset(vis, 0, sizeof vis)` with `fill(vis, vis + n + 1, 0)`. This will improve code readability and potentially improve performance.

4. Optimize the `qmi` function: Replace the `qmi` function with the following optimized version:

```cpp
int qmi(int cnt) {
  int x = 2, s = 1;
  while (cnt) {
    if (cnt & 1)
      s = (s * x) % N;
    x = (x * x) % N;
    cnt >>= 1;
  }
  return s;
}
```
This optimized version of the `qmi` function uses the binary exponentiation algorithm to calculate the modular exponentiation. It avoids unnecessary modulo operations and reduces the number of multiplications.

Optimized Code:

```cpp
#include <cstring>
#include <iostream>
#include <list>
using namespace std;
#define int long long
const int N = 1e9 + 7;
int t, n, cnt;
int a[400005], vis[400005];
list<int> e[400005];
void dfs(int u) {
  vis[u] = 1;
  list<int> stack;
  stack.push_back(u);
  while (!stack.empty()) {
    int v = stack.back();
    stack.pop_back();
    for (int i : e[v]) {
      if (!vis[i]) {
        vis[i] = 1;
        stack.push_back(i);
      }
    }
  }
}
int qmi(int cnt) {
  int x = 2, s = 1;
  while (cnt) {
    if (cnt & 1)
      s = (s * x) % N;
    x = (x * x) % N;
    cnt >>= 1;
  }
  return s;
}
signed main() {
  cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    cin >> n;
    cnt = 0;
    fill(vis, vis + n + 1, 0);
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
      cin >> a[i];
      e[i].clear();
    }
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
      int v;
      cin >> v;
      e[a[i]].push_back(v);
    }
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++)
      if (!vis[a[i]])
        cnt++, dfs(a[i]);
    cout << qmi(cnt) << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized code uses an array of linked lists to represent the graph, replaces the recursive DFS implementation with an iterative approach, replaces `memset` with `fill` algorithm, and optimizes the `qmi` function using the binary exponentiation algorithm. The changes are minimal yet effective, preserving the functionality and output of the original code while improving performance and reducing memory usage.
