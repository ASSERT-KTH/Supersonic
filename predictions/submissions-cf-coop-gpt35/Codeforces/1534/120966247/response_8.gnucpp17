The provided code seems to calculate the number of connected components in a directed graph and then raises 2 to the power of the number of connected components modulo N. However, there are several areas of the code that can be optimized to improve performance and reduce memory usage.

1. Redundant Memory Usage:
   - The array `a` is not used after the `e` array is constructed. Therefore, we can remove the array `a` altogether to reduce memory usage.

2. Unnecessary Memory Clearing:
   - The `memset` function is used to clear the `vis` array before each test case. However, the `dfs` function already sets the visited flag for each node. Therefore, we can remove the `memset` function call to improve performance.

3. Inefficient Loop Iteration:
   - The loop in the `dfs` function iterates over all the elements in the `e[u]` vector using the `.size()` function. However, using the `.size()` function in each iteration can cause additional overhead. We can improve this by storing the size of `e[u]` in a separate variable before the loop.

4. Inefficient Power Calculation:
   - The `qmi` function uses a loop to calculate the power of 2. However, this can be optimized using the exponentiation by squaring algorithm, which reduces the number of multiplications required.

5. Compiler Optimizations:
   - We can enable compiler optimizations by adding the `-O2` flag during compilation. This will allow the compiler to perform various optimizations, such as loop unrolling and constant folding.
