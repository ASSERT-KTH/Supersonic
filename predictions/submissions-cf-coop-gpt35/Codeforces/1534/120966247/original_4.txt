Upon analyzing the provided code, we can identify several potential areas for optimization:

1. Inefficient data structure: The code uses an array `a` to store the input values and a vector `e` to represent the graph. However, the size of the arrays is fixed to 400005, which is unnecessarily large. We can optimize this by using dynamically allocated arrays or resizable data structures.

2. Redundant memory initialization: The `memset` function is used to initialize the `vis` array to 0 before each test case. However, this is unnecessary because the `dfs` function already sets the visited nodes to 1.

3. Inefficient loop iteration: The code uses a traditional loop iteration over the vector `e[u]` using an index variable `i`. This can be optimized by using a range-based loop instead.

4. Inefficient power calculation: The `qmi` function uses a loop to calculate the power of 2. We can optimize this by using exponentiation by squaring, which reduces the number of multiplications.

Based on these observations, we can formulate the following optimization strategy:

1. Replace the fixed-size arrays `a` and `e` with dynamically allocated arrays or resizable data structures to avoid unnecessary memory usage.

2. Remove the `memset` function call to initialize the `vis` array, as it is redundant.

3. Replace the traditional loop iteration over `e[u]` with a range-based loop for better readability and potentially improved performance.

4. Optimize the `qmi` function by using exponentiation by squaring to calculate the power of 2.

Now, let's proceed with the step-by-step explanation of each optimization and the corresponding optimized code:

```cpp
#include <cstring>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;
#define int long long
const int N = 1e9 + 7;

int t, n, cnt;
int* a;
int* vis;
vector<int>* e;

void dfs(int u) {
  vis[u] = 1;
  for (int v : e[u]) {
    if (!vis[v]) {
      dfs(v);
    }
  }
}

int qmi(int cnt) {
  int x = 2, s = 1;
  while (cnt) {
    if (cnt & 1) {
      s = s * x % N;
    }
    x = x * x % N;
    cnt >>= 1;
  }
  return s % N;
}

signed main() {
  cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    cin >> n;
    cnt = 0;

    a = new int[n + 1];
    vis = new int[n + 1];
    e = new vector<int>[n + 1];

    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
      cin >> a[i];
      e[i].clear();
    }

    for (int v, i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
      cin >> v;
      e[a[i]].push_back(v);
    }

    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
      if (!vis[a[i]]) {
        cnt++;
        dfs(a[i]);
      }
    }

    cout << qmi(cnt) << endl;

    delete[] a;
    delete[] vis;
    delete[] e;
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Explanation of optimizations:

1. Replaced the fixed-size arrays `a` and `e` with dynamically allocated arrays using the `new` keyword. This allows us to allocate memory based on the input size `n` and avoid unnecessary memory usage.

2. Removed the `memset` function call to initialize the `vis` array. This is because the `dfs` function already sets the visited nodes to 1, making the initialization redundant.

3. Replaced the traditional loop iteration over `e[u]` with a range-based loop. This improves readability and potentially provides better performance by avoiding the need to access elements by index.

4. Optimized the `qmi` function by using exponentiation by squaring. This reduces the number of multiplications required to calculate the power of 2, leading to improved efficiency.

Overall, these optimizations aim to reduce unnecessary memory usage, improve loop iteration efficiency, and optimize the power calculation function. The optimized code preserves the functionality and output of the original code while minimizing memory usage and improving performance.
