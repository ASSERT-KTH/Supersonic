The provided code is a C++ program that solves a problem involving a tree-like structure and some computations. To optimize this code, we can focus on the following aspects:

1. Avoid unnecessary includes: The code includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header file, which is not recommended as it includes a large number of standard library headers. We should only include the necessary headers for the program to reduce compilation time and potential name clashes.

2. Improve the efficiency of mathematical operations: The code contains some mathematical operations, such as exponentiation and factorial calculations, that can be optimized to reduce the number of computations.

3. Optimize the search algorithm: The binary search algorithm used in the `bsearch` function can be improved by using a more efficient algorithm, such as the two-pointers technique or a hash-based approach.

4. Optimize the tree traversal: The depth-first search (DFS) algorithm used in the `dfs` function can be optimized to reduce memory usage and improve performance.

5. Avoid unnecessary vector copies: The code passes vectors by value in some functions, which creates unnecessary copies and increases memory usage. We can pass vectors by reference instead.

Now, let's go through each optimization step in detail:

1. Avoid unnecessary includes:
   - Remove the line `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`.
   - Include only the necessary headers for the program, such as `iostream`, `vector`, and `algorithm`.

2. Improve the efficiency of mathematical operations:
   - Replace the `bin` function with a more efficient algorithm for exponentiation, such as the exponentiation by squaring algorithm.
   - Replace the `ncr` function with a more efficient algorithm for calculating combinations, such as using Pascal's triangle or dynamic programming.

3. Optimize the search algorithm:
   - Replace the `bsearch` function with a more efficient search algorithm, such as the two-pointers technique or a hash-based approach.

4. Optimize the tree traversal:
   - Modify the `dfs` function to use an iterative approach instead of recursion, which can reduce memory usage and improve performance.
   - Use a stack to simulate the recursive call stack and store the necessary information for each node.
   - Replace the vector `vis` with a boolean array to mark visited nodes, which can reduce memory usage.

5. Avoid unnecessary vector copies:
   - Pass vectors by reference instead of by value in the `dfs` function and other relevant functions.
   - Modify the signature of the `dfs` function and other relevant functions to pass vectors by reference.

Here is the optimized code:
