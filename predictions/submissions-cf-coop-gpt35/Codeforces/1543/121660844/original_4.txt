The provided code seems to be a program that takes as input a number `N`, followed by `N` pairs of integers `a` and `b`. For each pair, the program calculates and outputs two values based on the following conditions:

- If either `a` or `b` is zero, the program outputs the maximum of `a` and `b` followed by `0`.
- If `a` and `b` are equal and not zero, the program outputs `0` followed by `0`.
- Otherwise, the program outputs the absolute difference between `a` and `b` followed by the minimum of `a mod (a - b)` and `a - b - a mod (a - b)`.

To optimize this code, we can focus on the following areas:

1. Remove unnecessary includes and macros.
2. Improve the efficiency of the `pow` function.
3. Optimize the `prime` function.
4. Streamline the conditional checks in the main loop.

Let's go through these optimizations step by step.

Step 1: Remove unnecessary includes and macros
-------------------------------------------------
The `bits/stdc++.h` header is not recommended as it includes all standard library headers, which can increase compilation time. Instead, we should include only the necessary headers. In this case, we need `iostream`, `vector`, and `algorithm`. We can remove the remaining includes.

The macros `ll`, `fast`, `eb`, `pb`, `ff`, `ss`, and `gcd` are not used in the code. We can remove them.

Step 2: Improve the efficiency of the `pow` function
------------------------------------------------------
The `pow` function is used to calculate `x` raised to the power `n` modulo `mod`. This can be optimized using the modular exponentiation technique. The current implementation uses repeated squaring to achieve this, but we can improve it further by using a more efficient algorithm called binary exponentiation.

Binary exponentiation works by repeatedly squaring the base and halving the exponent until the exponent becomes zero. This reduces the number of multiplications required.

Here's the optimized `pow` function:

```cpp
ll pow(ll x, ll n) {
  ll result = 1;
  while (n > 0) {
    if (n % 2 == 1) {
      result = (result * x) % mod;
    }
    x = (x * x) % mod;
    n /= 2;
  }
  return result;
}
```

Step 3: Optimize the `prime` function
-------------------------------------
The `prime` function calculates the number of prime factors of `x`. The current implementation uses trial division to count the factors. However, we can optimize it further by using a more efficient algorithm called the Sieve of Eratosthenes.

The Sieve of Eratosthenes is an algorithm that can generate all prime numbers up to a given limit. We can modify it to count the number of prime factors of `x`.

Here's the optimized `prime` function:

```cpp
int prime(int x) {
  int res = 0;
  vector<bool> isPrime(x + 1, true);
  for (int i = 2; i * i <= x; i++) {
    if (isPrime[i]) {
      for (int j = i * i; j <= x; j += i) {
        isPrime[j] = false;
      }
      while (x % i == 0) {
        x /= i;
        res++;
      }
    }
  }
  if (x > 1)
    res++;
  return res;
}
```

Step 4: Streamline the conditional checks in the main loop
----------------------------------------------------------
The current implementation of the main loop has multiple nested conditional checks. We can simplify and streamline these checks by rearranging the conditions and eliminating redundant checks.

Here's the optimized main loop:

```cpp
int main() {
  fast;
  int N;
  cin >> N;
  while (N--) {
    ll a, b;
    cin >> a >> b;
    if (a == 0 or b == 0) {
      cout << max(a, b) << ' ' << 0 << '\n';
      continue;
    }
    if (a == b) {
      cout << 0 << ' ' << 0 << '\n';
      continue;
    }
    if (b > a)
      swap(a, b);
    cout << a - b << ' ' << min(a % (a - b), a - b - a % (a - b)) << '\n';
  }
}
```

This optimized code should have improved efficiency and reduced memory usage compared to the original code.
