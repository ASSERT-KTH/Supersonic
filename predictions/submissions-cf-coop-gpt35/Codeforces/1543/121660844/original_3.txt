Code Analysis:
1. The code includes unnecessary header files (`<bits/stdc++.h>`) that can be replaced with specific header files required by the program.
2. The code uses macros for commonly used variables and functions. While macros can improve code readability, they can also result in unexpected behavior and poor performance.
3. The `pow` function is implemented to calculate the power of a number. However, the code is using a custom implementation instead of the standard `pow` function. This custom implementation can be replaced with the standard `pow` function for better performance.
4. The `prime` function is used to calculate the number of prime factors of a given number. The function can be optimized to reduce unnecessary iterations.
5. The code performs unnecessary checks for certain conditions, which can be optimized to improve performance.
6. The code uses `cout` for output, which can be slower compared to other output methods like `printf`.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Replace the unnecessary header file with specific required headers.
2. Replace the macros with explicit variable and function declarations.
3. Replace the custom `pow` function with the standard `pow` function.
4. Optimize the `prime` function to reduce unnecessary iterations.
5. Optimize the conditional checks to eliminate redundant conditions.
6. Use `printf` instead of `cout` for faster output.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Replace the unnecessary header file with specific required headers:
- The `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` includes all standard C++ headers, which can result in longer compilation times and unnecessary code bloat. Instead, include only the required headers, such as `<iostream>`, `<cmath>`, and `<cstdio>`.

2. Replace the macros with explicit variable and function declarations:
- The macros `ll`, `fast`, `eb`, `pb`, `ff`, `ss`, and `gcd` can be replaced with explicit variable and function declarations to improve code readability and avoid unexpected behavior.

3. Replace the custom `pow` function with the standard `pow` function:
- The custom `pow` function can be replaced with the standard `pow` function from the `<cmath>` header. This will improve code readability and potentially provide better performance.

4. Optimize the `prime` function to reduce unnecessary iterations:
- The `prime` function currently checks for factors up to the square root of the given number. However, it can be optimized to check only up to the square root of the remaining number after each factor is divided. This will reduce unnecessary iterations and improve performance.

5. Optimize the conditional checks to eliminate redundant conditions:
- The code includes multiple conditional checks that can be optimized to eliminate redundant conditions. For example, the condition `a == b and a != 0` can be simplified to `a == b`.

6. Use `printf` instead of `cout` for faster output:
- The code currently uses `cout` for output, which can be slower compared to `printf`. By replacing `cout` with `printf`, the output can be significantly faster.

Optimized Code Block:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>
#include <cstdio>

using namespace std;

const int mod = 1e9 + 7;

int prime(int x) {
  int res = 0;
  for (int i = 2; i * i <= x; i++) {
    while (x % i == 0) {
      x /= i;
      res++;
    }
  }
  if (x > 1)
    res++;
  return res;
}

int main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(0);
  cin.tie(0);
  
  int N;
  scanf("%d", &N);
  
  while (N--) {
    long long a, b;
    scanf("%lld %lld", &a, &b);
    
    if (a == 0 || b == 0) {
      printf("%lld 0\n", max(a, b));
      continue;
    }
    
    if (a == b) {
      printf("0 0\n");
      continue;
    }
    
    if (b > a)
      swap(a, b);
      
    printf("%lld %lld\n", a - b, min(a % (a - b), a - b - a % (a - b)));
  }
  
  return 0;
}
```
Note: The optimized code may still have room for further optimization, but the proposed changes should provide significant improvements in performance and memory usage.
