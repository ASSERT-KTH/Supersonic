Upon analyzing the given code, I have identified several areas that can be optimized to improve performance and reduce memory usage:

1. Unnecessary imports: The `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` import includes the entire standard library, which is unnecessary for this code. We can remove this import and include only the required headers.

2. Unused macros: The macros `eb`, `pb`, `ff`, `ss`, and `gcd` are not used in the code. We can remove these macros to simplify the code.

3. Redundant modulo operation: In the `pow` function, after calculating `result *= x`, we perform a modulo operation with `mod`. However, since we are calculating `result` iteratively, we can perform the modulo operation on `x` itself to avoid unnecessary multiplication with large numbers.

4. Redundant `continue` statements: In the main loop, the code uses `continue` statements after printing output in certain conditions. We can remove these `continue` statements to simplify the code.

5. Redundant check for `a == 0` in multiple places: The code checks for `a == 0` in two places. We can combine these conditions and remove the duplicate check.

6. Redundant check for `a == b and a != 0`: The code checks for `a == b` and `a != 0` separately. We can combine these conditions and simplify the code.

7. Unnecessary swapping: The code swaps `a` and `b` if `b > a`. However, this swap is not required as it does not affect the calculations in the code.

8. Avoid unnecessary modulo calculations: In the calculation of the second output value, we can avoid calculating `a % (a - b)` twice by storing it in a variable.

Based on these optimizations, I will now provide the optimized code.
