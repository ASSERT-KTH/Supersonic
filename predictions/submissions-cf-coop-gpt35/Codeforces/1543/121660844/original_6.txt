The provided code appears to be a C++ program that calculates some values based on given inputs. To optimize this code, we can analyze and identify potential areas of improvement. 

1. Code Analysis:
   - The code includes unnecessary header files, such as `<bits/stdc++.h>`, which includes all standard library headers. We can remove this line and include specific headers as needed.
   - The code uses a `pow` function to calculate `x^n`. However, this can be optimized by using a more efficient algorithm, such as exponentiation by squaring.
   - The `prime` function calculates the number of prime factors of a given number. We can optimize this function by checking for prime factors only up to the square root of the number.
   - The code uses multiple `if` statements to handle different cases. We can optimize this by rearranging the conditions to reduce the number of checks.
   - The code uses `std::endl` to flush the output stream, which can be replaced with `'\n'` for better performance.

2. Optimization Strategy:
   1. Replace the unnecessary header file with specific headers.
   2. Optimize the `pow` function using exponentiation by squaring.
   3. Optimize the `prime` function by checking prime factors up to the square root of the number.
   4. Rearrange the conditions in the main loop to minimize the number of checks.
   5. Replace `std::endl` with `'\n'` for better performance.

3. Step-by-Step Explanation:
   1. Remove the line `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` and include the necessary headers, such as `#include <iostream>` and `#include <vector>`.
   2. Replace the `pow` function with an optimized version using exponentiation by squaring. This algorithm reduces the number of multiplications required to calculate `x^n` from `O(n)` to `O(log n)`.
   3. Optimize the `prime` function by checking for prime factors only up to the square root of the number. This reduces the time complexity from `O(n)` to `O(sqrt(n))`.
   4. Rearrange the conditions in the main loop to minimize the number of checks. We can start by checking if both `a` and `b` are equal to zero, then check if they are equal to each other, and finally handle the remaining cases.
   5. Replace `std::endl` with `'\n'` for better performance. This avoids unnecessary flushing of the output stream after each line.

4. Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

#define ll long long
#define fast ios::sync_with_stdio(0); cin.tie(0);

int pow(ll x, ll n, int mod) {
  ll result = 1;
  while (n != 0) {
    if ((n & 1) == 1) {
      result *= x;
      result %= mod;
    }
    x *= x;
    x %= mod;
    n >>= 1;
  }
  return result;
}

int prime(int x) {
  int res = 0, i;
  for (i = 2; i * i <= x; i++) {
    while (x % i == 0) {
      x /= i;
      res++;
    }
  }
  if (x > 1)
    res++;
  return res;
}

int main() {
  fast;

  int N;
  cin >> N;

  while (N--) {
    ll a, b;
    cin >> a >> b;

    if (a == 0 || b == 0) {
      cout << max(a, b) << ' ' << 0 << '\n';
      continue;
    }

    if (a == b) {
      cout << 0 << ' ' << 0 << '\n';
      continue;
    }

    if (b > a)
      swap(a, b);

    cout << a - b << ' ' << min(a % (a - b), a - b - a % (a - b)) << '\n';
  }
}
```

This optimized code maintains the functionality and output of the original code while improving efficiency. It reduces unnecessary computations and minimizes memory usage. The optimizations made include using specific headers, optimizing the power function, optimizing the prime function, rearranging conditions, and using `'\n'` instead of `std::endl`. These changes result in a more efficient and optimized program.
