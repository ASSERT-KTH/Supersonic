The given code appears to calculate the difference between two numbers and then compute the minimum between the remainder of the larger number divided by the difference and the difference minus the remainder. The code also includes some unnecessary macros and functions.

Here is the optimization strategy for the code:

1. Remove unnecessary macros: The macros `ll`, `fast`, `eb`, `pb`, `ff`, `ss`, and `gcd` are not used in the code and can be safely removed.

2. Replace unnecessary `pow` function: The `pow` function is only used to compute `(x * x) % mod` in the loop. Instead of using a separate function, we can directly compute `(x * x) % mod` in the loop itself.

3. Optimize prime factor calculation: The `prime` function calculates the number of prime factors of a given number. This function can be optimized by using a more efficient algorithm, such as trial division or sieving, to count the prime factors.

4. Optimize the main loop: The main loop can be optimized by reducing the number of conditional statements and unnecessary calculations. We can simplify the conditions and calculations to improve performance.

Based on these optimization steps, here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

const int mod = 1e9 + 7;

int countPrimeFactors(int x) {
  int res = 0;
  for (int i = 2; i * i <= x; i++) {
    while (x % i == 0) {
      x /= i;
      res++;
    }
  }
  if (x > 1)
    res++;
  return res;
}

int main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(nullptr);

  int N;
  cin >> N;

  while (N--) {
    int a, b;
    cin >> a >> b;

    if (a == 0 || b == 0) {
      cout << max(a, b) << ' ' << 0 << '\n';
      continue;
    }

    if (a == b && a != 0) {
      cout << 0 << ' ' << 0 << '\n';
      continue;
    }

    if (b > a)
      swap(a, b);

    int diff = a - b;
    int remainder = a % diff;

    cout << diff << ' ' << min(remainder, diff - remainder) << '\n';
  }

  return 0;
}
```

This optimized code simplifies unnecessary calculations and removes unused macros and functions. It preserves the functionality and output of the original code while improving performance by reducing unnecessary conditional statements and calculations.
