The given code appears to be an implementation of a problem that involves calculating some values based on given inputs. The code takes an integer N as input, followed by N pairs of integers (a, b). For each pair, the code calculates and outputs two values based on the following conditions:

1. If either a or b is equal to 0, the code outputs the maximum of a and b as the first value, and 0 as the second value.
2. If a is equal to b and both a and b are non-zero, the code outputs 0 as both the first and second values.
3. For any other case, the code calculates the difference between a and b as the first value, and the minimum of (a % (a - b)) and (a - b - a % (a - b)) as the second value.

Now, let's analyze the code for potential performance optimizations:

1. The `bits/stdc++.h` header is included, which is not recommended as it includes a large number of unnecessary standard library headers. It is better to include only the necessary standard library headers.

2. The `pow()` function is implemented to calculate the power of a number. However, this function is not used in the code. Therefore, it can be safely removed to eliminate unnecessary computations.

3. The `prime()` function is implemented to calculate the number of prime factors of a given number. However, this function is also not used in the code. Thus, it can be removed to improve performance.

4. There is no need to use the `fast` macro, as it only synchronizes the input/output with C standard streams. Since the code does not involve heavy input/output operations, this macro is not necessary and can be removed.

5. The `gcd` macro is defined but not used in the code. It can be safely removed to reduce unnecessary macro definitions.

6. The `mod` variable is defined and assigned a constant value of 1e9 + 7. However, this variable is not used in the code. It can be removed to avoid unnecessary memory usage.

7. The `swap()` function is used to swap the values of `a` and `b` if `b` is greater than `a`. However, this operation can be simplified by using an `if` statement to check if `b` is greater than `a` and then swapping the values accordingly.

8. The code uses `cout` to output the results. However, using `printf` instead of `cout` can improve the output performance.
