Upon analyzing the given code, the following potential optimizations can be made:

1. Avoid unnecessary header inclusion: The code includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header, which is not a standard C++ header and may include unnecessary libraries. It is recommended to include only the required headers explicitly to minimize compilation time and reduce memory usage.

2. Remove unused macros: The code defines several macros such as `ll`, `fast`, `eb`, `pb`, `ff`, `ss`, and `gcd`, but they are not used in the code. Removing these unused macros can simplify the code and reduce preprocessing time.

3. Optimize exponentiation function: The `pow` function calculates `x` raised to the power `n` using the binary exponentiation algorithm. However, the current implementation performs modulo operation at each step, which can be slow. Instead, we can calculate `x` raised to the power `n` without modulo and then take the modulo once at the end.

4. Improve prime factorization function: The `prime` function calculates the number of distinct prime factors of `x`. The current implementation iterates from 2 to the square root of `x` and counts the number of times `x` can be divided by each prime factor. However, we can optimize this function by iterating only up to the square root of `x/2` and dividing `x` by each prime factor until it is no longer divisible.

5. Simplify conditional statements: The code contains multiple conditional statements that can be simplified. For example, the condition `if (a == b and a != 0)` can be simplified to `if (a == b && a != 0)`. Additionally, the conditions `if (a == 0 or b == 0)` and `if (b > a)` can be simplified to `if (a == 0 || b == 0)` and `if (b > a)` respectively.
