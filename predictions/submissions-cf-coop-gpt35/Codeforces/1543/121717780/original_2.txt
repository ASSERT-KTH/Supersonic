The given code appears to be solving a dynamic programming problem using a recursive approach. However, there are several areas of the code that can be optimized for efficiency. 

1. Inefficient Data Structures:
   - The code uses a 2D array `dp` to store intermediate results. However, the array is declared with fixed dimensions of 1005, which may be larger than necessary. Since the values of `cntC` and `cntM` are limited to the range [0,1000], the array can be resized to save memory.
   - The code uses a `vector<int>` to store intermediate results. However, it is not necessary to store all the intermediate results. Instead, we can use a memoization technique to store only the computed values and avoid redundant computations.

2. Redundant Computations:
   - The code recomputes the same values multiple times. For example, the expression `min(c / 2, v / 2)` is computed twice in each recursive call. We can store this value in a variable and reuse it.
   - The expression `(cntC + cntM + 1) * p` is also computed multiple times. We can store this value in a variable and reuse it.

3. Compiler Optimizations:
   - We can use compiler optimizations, such as loop unrolling, to improve the performance of the nested loops in the `main` function.

Based on these observations, I will now provide a step-by-step explanation of the proposed optimizations and provide the optimized code.
