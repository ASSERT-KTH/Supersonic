Code Analysis:
1. The code uses a recursive approach to calculate the expected number of rounds until a customer is served.
2. The code uses a 2D array `dp` to store the computed values for different states of `c` and `m`. However, the array is not being fully utilized as it has a fixed size of 1005x1005, even though the values of `c` and `m` can be much larger.
3. The code uses floating-point arithmetic for calculations, which can be computationally expensive and imprecise.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Replace the `dp` array with a more efficient data structure to avoid unnecessary memory usage and improve cache locality.
2. Modify the recursive function to use dynamic programming and memoization to avoid redundant computations.
3. Use integer arithmetic instead of floating-point arithmetic to improve performance and accuracy.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Replace the `dp` array with a `map` data structure to store computed values for different states of `c` and `m`. This will allow us to avoid unnecessary memory usage and improve cache locality. The key for the map will be a pair of integers `(cntC, cntM)`, representing the number of customers served with `c` and `m` remaining, respectively. The value will be the expected number of rounds until a customer is served.
2. Modify the recursive function to use dynamic programming and memoization. Before making a recursive call, check if the value for the current state `(cntC, cntM)` is already computed and stored in the `map`. If so, return the stored value instead of making the recursive call. If not, compute the value using the recursive approach and store it in the `map` before returning.
3. Use integer arithmetic instead of floating-point arithmetic to improve performance and accuracy. Multiply all the values of `c`, `m`, `p`, and `v` by a large factor (e.g., 10000) to convert them to integers. This will allow us to perform calculations using integer arithmetic instead of floating-point arithmetic.
