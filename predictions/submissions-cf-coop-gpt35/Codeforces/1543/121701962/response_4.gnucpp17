The provided code appears to be a program that takes input in the form of an integer `n`, followed by `n` integers. It calculates the sum of the `n` integers and performs some calculations based on the sum. The final result is then printed to the console.

To optimize this code, we can identify several areas for improvement:

1. Unnecessary includes: The code includes the entire `bits/stdc++.h` library, which is not recommended for performance-critical code. We should remove this and include specific headers as needed.

2. Use of `using namespace std`: This line brings all names from the `std` namespace into the global namespace, which can lead to naming conflicts and make the code harder to understand. It's better to use the `std::` prefix when necessary.

3. Use of `#define` macros: Macros can be error-prone and make the code harder to understand. Instead, we can replace these macros with regular functions or constants.

4. Variable shadowing: The variable `x` is used for two different purposes in the code, which can lead to confusion. We should use a different variable name to avoid this.

5. Dynamic array allocation: The code uses a dynamic array `a[n]` to store the input integers. Dynamic memory allocation can be expensive, and in this case, we know the size of the array at compile-time. We should use a static array instead.

6. Redundant checks: The code checks whether `x` is both `true` and `false`, which is redundant. We can remove the `!x` check and simplify the logic.

7. Input/output optimizations: We can improve the performance of input/output by disabling synchronization with C standard streams using `ios::sync_with_stdio(false)`. We should also remove the `freopen` calls, as they are not necessary for the optimization process.
