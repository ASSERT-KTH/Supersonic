Code Analysis:

1. The code includes unnecessary header file `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`. It's better to include only the required header files to reduce compile time and avoid namespace pollution.
2. The code uses macros for commonly used types and functions, such as `int`, `vector`, `push_back`, etc. While this can make the code more concise, it can also make it harder to read and understand. It's better to use the full names or typedefs for clarity.
3. The code uses a fixed-size array `int a[n]` to store the input values. This can be a problem if `n` is very large, as it may lead to a stack overflow or inefficient memory usage. Using a `vector` instead would be more efficient.
4. The code calculates the sum of the input values in a loop, which has a time complexity of O(n). This can be optimized to calculate the sum in constant time.
5. The code checks if the sum is divisible by `n` to determine if `x` should be set to true. This check is unnecessary, as it can be determined by checking if `sum % n == 0`.
6. The code has multiple if-else conditions to calculate the result based on different conditions. This can be simplified to a single calculation.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Replace the unnecessary header file `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` with the required header files.
2. Remove the macros and use the full names or typedefs for clarity.
3. Replace the fixed-size array `int a[n]` with a `vector<int>` to improve memory efficiency.
4. Calculate the sum of the input values in constant time by using `accumulate` from the `<numeric>` header.
5. Replace the if-else conditions with a single calculation using the formula `x * (n - x)`, where `x` is the remainder of `sum % n`.

Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. Remove the unnecessary header file `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` and include the required header files:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <numeric>
```

2. Remove the macros and use the full names or typedefs for clarity:
```cpp
using ll = long long;
using vi = std::vector<ll>;
using namespace std;
```

3. Replace the fixed-size array `int a[n]` with a `vector<int>` to improve memory efficiency:
```cpp
int n;
cin >> n;
vi a(n);
```

4. Calculate the sum of the input values in constant time using `accumulate` from the `<numeric>` header:
```cpp
int sum = accumulate(a.begin(), a.end(), 0);
```

5. Replace the if-else conditions with a single calculation using the formula `x * (n - x)`, where `x` is the remainder of `sum % n`:
```cpp
int x = sum % n;
cout << x * (n - x) << "\n";
```

Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <numeric>
using ll = long long;
using vi = std::vector<ll>;
using namespace std;

void solve() {
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  vi a(n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> a[i];
  }
  int sum = accumulate(a.begin(), a.end(), 0);
  int x = sum % n;
  cout << x * (n - x) << "\n";
}

int main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(0);
  cin.tie(0);
  cout.tie(0);
#ifndef ONLINE_JUDGE
  freopen("input.txt", "r", stdin);
  freopen("output.txt", "w", stdout);
#endif
  int t = 1;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--)
    solve();
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized code improves the memory usage by using a `vector` instead of a fixed-size array and calculates the sum of the input values in constant time. It also simplifies the logic by replacing multiple if-else conditions with a single calculation.
