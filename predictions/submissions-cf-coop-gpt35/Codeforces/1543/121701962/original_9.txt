Upon analyzing the given code, here are some potential optimizations that can be made:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The code includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header, which is not recommended as it includes all standard library headers, leading to increased compilation time and potentially unused code. Instead, include only the necessary headers.

2. Avoid using macros: Macros like `int long long`, `vi`, and others can be replaced with their actual definitions to improve code readability and avoid potential issues.

3. Minimize the use of `std::endl`: `std::endl` is slower than using the newline character `\n` directly. Replace `std::endl` with `\n` to improve output performance.

4. Avoid unnecessary calculations: The code calculates the sum of all elements in the array `a[]` twice. Instead, calculate it only once and store it in a variable.

5. Use a more efficient data structure: The code uses an array `a[]` to store the input values, which can be inefficient for large inputs. Consider using a `std::vector` instead, which provides dynamic memory allocation and resizing.

6. Remove unnecessary boolean variable: The variable `x` is unnecessary and can be removed. Its value is determined by the condition `sum % n == 0`.

7. Optimize the computation of the final result: The code uses multiple `if` statements to calculate the final result. This can be simplified by using a single formula to calculate the result based on the modulo of `sum` and `n`.

8. Consider using compiler optimizations: Enable compiler optimizations to let the compiler automatically optimize the code. This can be done by adding appropriate compiler flags or pragma directives.

Based on these optimizations, here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

const int MOD = 1e9 + 7;

int gcd(int a, int b) {
    return b == 0 ? a : gcd(b, a % b);
}

void solve() {
    int n, sum = 0;
    std::cin >> n;
    std::vector<int> a(n);
  
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        std::cin >> a[i];
        sum += a[i];
    }
  
    int result = 0;
  
    if (sum % n == 0) {
        result = 0;
    } else {
        int x = sum % n;
        result = x * (n - x);
    }
  
    std::cout << result << '\n';
}

int main() {
    std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
    std::cin.tie(nullptr);
    std::cout.tie(nullptr);

    #ifndef ONLINE_JUDGE
    freopen("input.txt", "r", stdin);
    freopen("output.txt", "w", stdout);
    #endif

    int t;
    std::cin >> t;
  
    while (t--) {
        solve();
    }
  
    return 0;
}
```

In this optimized version, unnecessary includes and macros have been removed, and the code has been simplified and made more efficient. The use of `std::vector` instead of an array improves memory allocation, and unnecessary calculations have been eliminated. Compiler optimizations can be enabled during the compilation process to further enhance the performance of the code.
