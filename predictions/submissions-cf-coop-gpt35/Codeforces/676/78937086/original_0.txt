Upon analyzing the given code, several potential areas for optimization can be identified:

1. Redundant Modulo Operations: The code frequently performs modulo operations on large numbers. These operations can be time-consuming and can be optimized by using a modulo function that handles the computation more efficiently.

2. Excessive Memory Usage: The code uses arrays to store intermediate results, even when a single variable would suffice. This results in unnecessary memory usage and can be optimized by using only the required variables.

3. Unnecessary String Comparisons: The code compares strings using the "!=" operator, which involves comparing each character in the string. This can be optimized by using a more efficient string comparison method, such as comparing the string lengths first and only then comparing the characters if necessary.

4. Unoptimized Loop: The code uses a loop to calculate the values for the arrays mm1, mm2, mm3, and mm4. However, since the size of these arrays is known beforehand, the loop can be unrolled to avoid unnecessary iterations.

5. Inefficient Data Structure: The code uses a vector to store the values entered by the user. However, since the size of the vector is known beforehand, using a fixed-size array would be more efficient.

To optimize the code, the following steps can be taken:

1. Replace the `mulmod` function with a more efficient implementation that reduces the number of modulo operations. This can be done using the property `(a * b) % p = ((a % p) * (b % p)) % p`.

2. Replace the `fastexp` function with a more efficient implementation that uses bitwise operations instead of modulo operations. This can be done by using the property `x^y % p = (x % p)^(y % p) % p`.

3. Replace the `check_composite` function with a more efficient implementation that avoids unnecessary iterations. This can be done by checking the composite condition in a single loop instead of two separate loops.

4. Replace the `isPrime` function with a more efficient implementation that avoids unnecessary iterations. This can be done by checking the prime condition in a single loop instead of two separate loops.

5. Replace the vector `values` with a fixed-size array, as the size of the vector is known beforehand.

6. Unroll the loop that calculates the values for the arrays mm1, mm2, mm3, and mm4.

7. Use a more efficient string comparison method that compares the lengths of the strings first before comparing the characters.

With these optimizations in mind, here is the optimized code:
