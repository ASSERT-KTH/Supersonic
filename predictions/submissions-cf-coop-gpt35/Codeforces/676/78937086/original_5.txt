The given code is a C++ program that checks whether a given sequence of numbers is a winning sequence or not. The program takes two inputs: `n` - the length of the sequence, and `k` - a constant.

Here are some potential optimizations that can be made to improve the efficiency of the code:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The code includes the entire `<bits/stdc++.h>` library, which is not recommended. Instead, include only the necessary libraries such as `<iostream>`, `<vector>`, `<string>`, etc.

2. Minimize namespace usage: The code currently uses the `std` namespace extensively. It is generally considered good practice to avoid using the entire `std` namespace. Instead, use the `std::` prefix for specific functions and objects.

3. Avoid unnecessary integer conversions: In the section where the input values are read, the code converts each string value to an integer using `stoi()`. Since the values are not used as integers, this conversion is unnecessary and can be avoided.

4. Optimize the prime checking algorithm: The `isPrime()` function uses the Miller-Rabin primality test to check whether a given number is prime or not. This algorithm can be optimized further by using a more efficient algorithm such as the Sieve of Eratosthenes or the AKS primality test.

5. Optimize the multiplication and modular operations: The code uses multiple multiplication and modular operations, which can be time-consuming. One optimization strategy is to precompute powers of `k` using an array and reuse them in the calculations instead of recalculating them every time.

6. Avoid unnecessary computations: In the section where the winning sequence is checked, there are multiple conditions and calculations that can be simplified. For example, the condition `(values[0] == "?" and played % 2 == 1)` can be simplified to `(played % 2 == 1)` since `values[0]` is set to `"?"` in the beginning.

7. Optimize memory usage: The code uses four arrays `mm1`, `mm2`, `mm3`, and `mm4`, which can be replaced with a single array. This will reduce the memory usage and also simplify the code.

8. Remove unused variables: The variables `pii`, `pll`, `vii`, and `vll` are defined but not used in the code. Removing these variables will make the code cleaner and easier to understand.

Now, let's go through each optimization step in detail:

1. Remove unnecessary includes:
Remove the line `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`, and include only the necessary libraries such as `<iostream>`, `<vector>`, `<string>`, etc.

2. Minimize namespace usage:
Replace the line `using namespace std;` with specific `using` statements for the required objects and functions, such as `using std::cout;`, `using std::cin;`, etc.

3. Avoid unnecessary integer conversions:
Remove the line `fv.pb(stoi(values[i]));` since the converted integers are not used in the subsequent code.

4. Optimize the prime checking algorithm:
Replace the `isPrime()` function with a more efficient algorithm such as the Sieve of Eratosthenes or the AKS primality test. This will significantly improve the performance of prime checking.

5. Optimize the multiplication and modular operations:
Precompute the powers of `k` using an array and reuse them in the calculations instead of recalculating them every time. This will reduce the number of multiplications and modular operations.

6. Avoid unnecessary computations:
Remove the condition `(values[0] == "0" or (values[0] == "?" and played % 2 == 1))` and replace it with `(played % 2 == 1)` since `values[0]` is set to `"?"` in the beginning.

7. Optimize memory usage:
Replace the arrays `mm1`, `mm2`, `mm3`, and `mm4` with a single array. This will reduce the memory usage and simplify the code. For example, replace `ll mm1[fv.size() + 5];` with `ll mm[fv.size() + 5][4];`, and update the corresponding calculations accordingly.

8. Remove unused variables:
Remove the variables `pii`, `pll`, `vii`, and `vll`, as they are not used in the code.

Now, let's implement these optimizations in the code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <string>

    if (p == value)
      return true;
    if (check_composite(p, value, d, r))
      return false;
  }
  return true;
}

int main() {
  int n, k;
  cin >> n >> k;
  int played = 0;
  string p;
  vector<string> values;
  for (int i = 0; i < n + 1; i++) {
    string s;
    cin >> s;

    if (s != "?")
      played++;
    values.push_back(s);

  if (k == 0) {

      mm[i][3] = (1LL * mm[i - 1][3] * k) % mods2;
    }
    ll fv1 = 0;
    ll fv2 = 0;
    ll fv3 = 0;
    ll fv4 = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < fv.size(); i++) {
      fv1 = (fv1 + (1LL * fv[i] * mm[i][0]) % MOD) % MOD;
      fv2 = (fv2 + (1LL * fv[i] * mm[i][1]) % mods) % mods;
      fv3 = (fv3 + (1LL * fv[i] * mm[i][2]) % mods1) % mods1;
      fv4 = (fv4 + (1LL * fv[i] * mm[i][3]) % mods2) % mods2;
    }
    if (fv4 == 0 and fv1 == 0 and fv2 == 0 and fv3 == 0)
      cout << "Yes";
    else
      cout << "No";
    return 0;
  }
  if (played % 2 == 1) {
    if ((n + 1 - played) % 2 == 1)
      cout << "Yes";
    else
      cout << "No";
  } else {
    if ((n + 1 - played) % 2 == 0)
      cout << "Yes";
    else
      cout << "No";
  }
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized code should be more efficient in terms of running time and memory usage compared to the original code.
