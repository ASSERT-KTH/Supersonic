The given code seems to be written in C++ and checks if a given sequence of numbers can be a valid permutation based on certain conditions. 

Upon analyzing the code, we can identify a few potential areas for optimization:

1. Unnecessary includes: The code includes the entire "bits/stdc++.h" library, which is not recommended and can slow down the compilation process. It is better to include only the necessary headers.

2. Redundant macros: There are several macros defined in the code, such as "MOD", "mods", "mods1", "mods2", and "FIFO". These macros are not being used, so they can be removed.

3. Inefficient data structure: The code uses a vector of strings to store the input values. However, since the input values are either "0" or "?", which can be represented as integers, it would be more memory-efficient to use a vector of integers instead.

4. Redundant computations: The code computes the powers of "k" multiple times using separate arrays "mm1", "mm2", "mm3", and "mm4". Instead, we can compute these powers once and store them in variables.

5. Inefficient string comparison: The code uses the string comparison operator "!=" to check if a value is "?" or not. However, this comparison can be optimized by using a character comparison.

6. Unnecessary modulo operations: The code uses modulo operations unnecessarily in multiple places. We can minimize the number of modulo operations to improve the efficiency of the code.

7. Magic numbers: The code uses several "magic numbers" like 12, 5, 4, etc., which are not explained or documented. It would be better to use named constants or provide comments to explain the significance of these numbers.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: Remove the unnecessary "bits/stdc++.h" include and include only the necessary headers.

2. Remove redundant macros: Remove the unused macros "MOD", "mods", "mods1", "mods2", and "FIFO".

3. Replace vector of strings with vector of integers: Replace the vector "values" with a vector of integers to store the input values efficiently.

4. Compute powers of "k" once: Compute the powers of "k" once and store them in variables instead of using separate arrays.

5. Replace string comparison with character comparison: Replace the string comparison "!=" with a character comparison to check if a value is "?" or not.

6. Optimize modulo operations: Minimize the number of modulo operations by avoiding unnecessary modulo operations.

7. Replace magic numbers: Replace the magic numbers in the code with named constants or provide comments to explain their significance.

Let's proceed with the step-by-step explanation and the optimized code.
