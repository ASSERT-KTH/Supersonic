The given code appears to be a program that determines whether a given sequence of numbers can be a valid sequence of moves in a game. The program takes input values `n` and `k`, where `n` represents the length of the sequence and `k` represents a constant value. The program then reads `n+1` strings from input and performs some calculations to determine if the sequence is valid.

Upon analysis of the code, the following potential performance bottlenecks and areas for optimization can be identified:

1. String Operations: The code uses string comparison operations (`s != "?"`) inside a loop to determine the number of non-empty strings (`played`). String operations can be expensive compared to integer operations, especially when performed repeatedly inside a loop.

2. Memory Usage: The program uses a vector of strings (`values`) to store the input values. However, the program only requires counting the number of non-empty strings (`played`), and the actual values are not used beyond that point. Storing the values in a vector may result in unnecessary memory usage.

3. Loop Optimization: The program uses several loops to perform calculations on the input values. These loops can potentially be optimized to reduce the number of iterations or improve memory access patterns.

4. Redundant Calculations: The program performs several modular arithmetic calculations (`mm1[i] = (1LL * mm1[i - 1] * k) % MOD`) inside a loop. These calculations can be redundant if the same values are used repeatedly.

Based on these observations, the following optimization strategy can be formulated:

1. Replace string operations with integer operations to determine the number of non-empty strings (`played`).

2. Instead of storing the input values in a vector, only count the number of non-empty strings while reading the input. This will reduce memory usage.

3. Optimize the loops to reduce the number of iterations or improve memory access patterns. For example, pre-calculate the values of `mm1`, `mm2`, `mm3`, and `mm4` outside the loop, and use these pre-calculated values inside the loop.

4. Minimize redundant calculations by storing the pre-calculated values of `mm1`, `mm2`, `mm3`, and `mm4` in separate variables and reuse them in the loop.

5. Consider using compiler optimizations and pragma directives to suggest optimizations to the compiler, such as loop unrolling or instruction-level optimizations.

Next, I will provide a step-by-step explanation of each optimization and then present the optimized code.
