Upon analyzing the provided code, the following potential areas for optimization and improvement have been identified:

1. Redundant Memory Allocation: The code uses four separate arrays (`mm1`, `mm2`, `mm3`, `mm4`) to store pre-calculated modular powers of `k`. These arrays are not necessary and can be replaced with a single array, reducing memory usage.

2. Unnecessary Modular Operations: The code performs modular operations at each iteration of the loop, which can be optimized by performing the modular operation only at the end of the loop.

3. Redundant Loop: The loop that calculates the modular powers of `k` runs for `fv.size() + 5` iterations, even though only `fv.size()` iterations are necessary. This can be optimized by reducing the number of iterations.

4. Unused Variables: The variables `p` and `k` are defined but not used in the code. These variables can be removed to improve code readability.

5. Inefficient Input Handling: The code reads the input values into a vector of strings, which can be improved by directly converting the input values to integers and storing them in a vector of integers.

6. Constant Array Sizes: The arrays `TestMillerRabin` and `values` have fixed sizes, which can be improved by using dynamic arrays or vectors with a size equal to the input values.

Based on these observations, the following optimization strategy can be formulated:

1. Replace the four separate arrays (`mm1`, `mm2`, `mm3`, `mm4`) with a single array (`mm`) to store pre-calculated modular powers of `k`.
2. Perform the modular operation only at the end of the loop, instead of at each iteration.
3. Reduce the number of iterations in the loop that calculates the modular powers of `k`.
4. Remove the unused variables `p` and `k`.
5. Convert the input values directly to integers and store them in a vector of integers.
6. Use dynamic arrays or vectors with a size equal to the input values for `TestMillerRabin` and `values`.

The step-by-step explanation of each optimization step is as follows:

1. Replace the four separate arrays (`mm1`, `mm2`, `mm3`, `mm4`) with a single array (`mm`) to store pre-calculated modular powers of `k`:
   - Instead of declaring four separate arrays, declare a single array `mm` with a size equal to `fv.size() + 5`.
   - Modify the loop that calculates the modular powers of `k` to use the `mm` array.
   - Replace `mm1[i]`, `mm2[i]`, `mm3[i]`, and `mm4[i]` with `mm[i]` in the loop.

2. Perform the modular operation only at the end of the loop, instead of at each iteration:
   - Move the modular operation `x % p` outside the loop in the `mulmod` function.
   - Replace `x` with `x % p` in the loop.

3. Reduce the number of iterations in the loop that calculates the modular powers of `k`:
   - Modify the loop condition from `i < fv.size() + 5` to `i < fv.size()`.

4. Remove the unused variables `p` and `k`:
   - Remove the line `int n, k;` from the `main` function.
   - Remove the lines `cin >> n >> k;` and `if (k == 0) { ... }` from the `main` function.

5. Convert the input values directly to integers and store them in a vector of integers:
   - Replace the vector `values` with a vector of integers `fv`.
   - Modify the loop that reads the input values to convert the strings directly to integers using `stoi` function.

6. Use dynamic arrays or vectors with a size equal to the input values for `TestMillerRabin` and `values`:
   - Replace the fixed-size arrays `TestMillerRabin` and `values` with dynamic arrays or vectors.
