The given code is for a program that solves a specific problem. However, it appears that the code could be improved in terms of performance and memory usage. Let's analyze the code and identify potential areas of improvement.

1. Redundant Libraries: The code includes several unnecessary library headers, such as `<array>`, `<set>`, `<map>`, and `<unordered_set>`. Since these libraries are not used in the code, they can be removed.

2. Unnecessary Variable Initialization: The variables `inf`, `m`, `p`, `cnt`, and `b` are initialized but not used in the code. These variable initializations can be removed to improve efficiency.

3. Inefficient Data Structures: The code uses a `vector<bool>` to store boolean values. However, `vector<bool>` is known for its inefficient memory usage and slow performance. It is recommended to use a `vector<char>` or `vector<int>` instead, which will improve both memory usage and performance.

4. Excessive Output: The code makes excessive use of `cout` to print intermediate results. This can significantly slow down the program, especially when the output is redirected to a file. Instead, we can store the intermediate results in variables and print them all at once at the end.

5. Redundant Sorting: The code sorts the `v` vector unnecessarily. Since we only need to find a pair of elements with the same value, we can skip the sorting step and directly check for the condition in a single pass.

6. Inefficient Loop: The loop that initializes the `ans` vector can be optimized. Instead of performing an XOR operation for each element, we can calculate `ans[0]` first and then use it to calculate the remaining elements.

7. Compiler Optimizations: We can use compiler optimizations to improve the performance of the code. For example, we can enable compiler optimizations using the `-O2` flag or use pragma directives to provide optimization hints to the compiler.
