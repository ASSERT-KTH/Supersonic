Upon analyzing the given code, here are some potential optimizations that can be made:

1. Remove unnecessary headers: The code includes several unnecessary header files such as `<array>`, `<map>`, `<set>`, and `<unordered_set>`. Since these headers are not used in the code, they should be removed to reduce compile time.

2. Avoid unnecessary vector resizing: The code initializes two vectors, `x` and `ans`, with a size of `n` and assigns all elements to 0. However, later in the code, the elements of these vectors are overwritten. Instead of initializing them with 0, we can directly assign values to the elements while reading input, which will avoid the unnecessary resizing and initialization.

3. Optimize sorting: The code uses `std::sort` to sort the `v` vector based on the first element of each pair. However, we can optimize this step by using a counting sort algorithm since the range of values is limited.

4. Replace unnecessary boolean variable: The code uses a boolean variable `b` to check if there are consecutive equal values in the sorted `v` vector. Instead, we can directly check this condition in a loop and break out of the loop as soon as we find consecutive equal values.

5. Optimize XOR operations: The code performs XOR operations multiple times inside loops. We can optimize this by using a temporary variable to store the result of the XOR operation and avoid redundant calculations.

6. Optimize output printing: The code uses multiple print statements to print the result vector. Instead, we can store the values in a string and print it once.
