The provided code calculates the maximum possible value of the sum (A + B + C) given certain constraints. However, the code has a few areas that can be optimized to improve performance.

1. Inefficient Memory Usage:
   - The code uses four integer variables `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` to store user input values. However, these values are not used individually but are instead used as constants within loops. This means that we can directly use the input values without storing them in separate variables. This will reduce memory usage.

2. Redundant Computations:
   - The expression `(n - (A * a + B * b)) / c` is computed in each iteration of the inner loop. Since it does not depend on the loop variables `A` and `B`, we can compute it once before the inner loop begins and reuse the result.

3. Inefficient Loop Bounds:
   - The loop bounds for `A` and `B` are set to 4000, which is an arbitrary value. These bounds can be optimized by calculating the maximum values of `A` and `B` based on the input values `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c`. This will reduce the number of iterations in the loops, leading to improved performance.

4. Compiler Optimizations:
   - We can suggest the use of compiler optimizations, such as loop unrolling and compiler-specific flags, to hint the compiler to optimize the code further. However, this may vary depending on the compiler being used and the platform.
