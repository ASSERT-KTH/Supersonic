The given code appears to implement a solution to a problem using a segment tree. However, there are several areas of the code that can be optimized to improve performance and reduce memory usage.

1. Unnecessary Macros:
   - The macros `pb`, `ppb`, `yes`, `no`, `dbg`, `F`, and `S` are not used in the code and can be removed.

2. Redundant Includes:
   - The `bits/stdc++.h` header includes a large number of standard library headers, which can slow down the compilation process. It is recommended to include only the necessary headers instead of using `bits/stdc++.h`.

3. Unnecessary Use of `vector`:
   - The `vector` `seg_tree` is used to store the values of the segment tree. However, since the size of the segment tree is fixed at compile time, it is more efficient to use a static array instead of a `vector`.

4. Inefficient Memory Usage:
   - The static array `seg_tree` is initialized with size `4 * N + 5`, which is larger than necessary. The size can be reduced to `2 * N + 1` since the maximum number of nodes in a segment tree with `N` elements is `2 * N`.

5. Redundant GCD Computations:
   - The `build_tree` function computes the GCD of the left and right child nodes at each level of the segment tree. However, this is unnecessary since the GCD of two numbers does not change if they are combined together. Therefore, the GCD computations can be removed from the `build_tree` function.

6. Redundant GCD Computations in the `solve` function:
   - The `solve` function computes the GCD of the array `a` using a loop. However, this computation is redundant since the GCD of `a` is already computed during the `build_tree` function. Therefore, the loop can be removed.

7. Redundant GCD Computations in the Binary Search Loop:
   - The binary search loop in the `solve` function computes the GCD of the subarray `[l, mid]` at each iteration. However, this computation is redundant since the GCD of the subarray `[l, mid]` is already computed in the `query` function. Therefore, the GCD computation can be removed from the loop.

8. Inefficient Binary Search:
   - The binary search loop in the `solve` function uses a binary search to find the smallest index `temp` such that the GCD of the subarray `[i, temp]` is equal to `g`. However, this can be optimized by using a two-pointer approach. We can maintain two pointers `l` and `r` that represent the left and right boundaries of the subarray. Initially, `l = i + 1` and `r = 2 * n`. At each step, we check if the GCD of the subarray `[l, r]` is equal to `g`. If it is, we update `temp` and move the left pointer `l` to the right. Otherwise, we update the GCD of `a[i]` with the GCD of the subarray `[l, r]` and move the right pointer `r` to the left. This approach eliminates the need for the binary search and reduces the number of GCD computations.

9. Compiler Optimizations:
   - To further optimize the code, we can enable compiler optimizations by using compiler-specific pragmas or flags. These optimizations can include loop unrolling, function inlining, and code vectorization. However, the specific optimizations depend on the compiler being used and the target architecture.

Based on the above analysis, the following optimized code is provided:
