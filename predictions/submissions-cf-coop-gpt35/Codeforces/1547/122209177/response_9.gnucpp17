Code Analysis:
- The code uses a segment tree to efficiently calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of a range of elements in an array.
- The build_tree function builds the segment tree by recursively dividing the array into smaller segments and calculating the GCD for each segment.
- The query function performs a range query on the segment tree to find the GCD of a given range.
- The solve function reads the input, builds the segment tree, and then iterates over each element in the array to find the maximum length of a subarray whose GCD is equal to the overall GCD of the array.
- The main function reads the number of test cases and calls the solve function for each test case.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Avoid unnecessary calculations:
- The solve function first calculates the GCD of all elements in the array using a loop. This calculation is not necessary because the segment tree already stores the GCD for each segment. We can remove this loop and use the GCD stored in the segment tree instead.
- The solve function also calculates the GCD of the current element with the GCD of the previous elements in the array. This can be avoided by updating the GCD stored in the segment tree when necessary.

2. Optimize the range query:
- The query function currently performs a binary search to find the range where the GCD is equal to the overall GCD of the array. This binary search can be optimized by using a two-pointer approach. We can maintain two pointers, one at the start and one at the end of the range, and move them based on the GCD calculated for each segment.

3. Remove unnecessary macros:
- The code includes several macros that are not used. We can remove these macros to simplify the code.

4. Use a more efficient data structure:
- The segment tree is currently implemented using a vector, which may lead to inefficient memory usage. We can switch to using a dynamically allocated array to reduce memory overhead.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Remove unnecessary calculations:
- Remove the loop in the solve function that calculates the GCD of all elements in the array.
- Update the GCD stored in the segment tree when necessary.

2. Optimize the range query:
- Modify the query function to use a two-pointer approach instead of binary search.
- Remove the unnecessary variables "temp" and "cnt".

3. Remove unnecessary macros:
- Remove the unused macros.

4. Use a more efficient data structure:
- Replace the vector used for the segment tree with a dynamically allocated array.
