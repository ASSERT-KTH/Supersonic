Code Analysis:
1. The code uses some macros to define common operations such as pushing back elements into a vector, popping back elements from a vector, and iterating over a range of values.
2. The code defines a global vector `seg_tree` to store the segment tree, which has a size of 4 * N + 5. The vector is initialized with 0.
3. The code defines a global array `a` to store the input elements. The size of the array is N.
4. The code defines a function `build_tree` to build the segment tree recursively. The function takes the tree index, start index, and end index as arguments.
5. The code defines a function `query` to perform a range query on the segment tree. The function takes the tree index, start index, end index, query start index, and query end index as arguments.
6. The code defines a function `solve` to solve the problem. The function reads the input, builds the segment tree, and performs a series of queries on the segment tree to find the maximum subarray with a gcd equal to the gcd of all elements.
7. The code defines the `main` function, which reads the number of test cases and calls the `solve` function for each test case.

Potential optimizations:
1. Avoid using macros: The use of macros can make the code less readable and harder to debug. It is better to use inline functions or constants instead.
2. Avoid using global variables: Global variables can make the code less modular and harder to optimize. It is better to pass variables as arguments to functions instead.
3. Optimize the segment tree construction: The current implementation builds the segment tree recursively, which has a time complexity of O(N log N). This can be optimized to O(N) by using an iterative approach.
4. Optimize the range query: The current implementation performs range queries on the segment tree recursively, which has a time complexity of O(log N). This can be optimized to O(1) by preprocessing the segment tree to store the gcd of each range.
5. Optimize the gcd calculations: The current implementation uses the `__gcd` function from the standard library to calculate the gcd of two numbers. This function has a time complexity of O(log min(a, b)). This can be optimized to O(log N) by using the Euclidean algorithm to calculate the gcd.
6. Optimize the binary search: The current implementation uses a binary search to find the rightmost index where the gcd of a subarray is equal to the gcd of all elements. This binary search can be optimized by using two pointers to keep track of the left and right indices of the subarray.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Replace macros with inline functions or constants.
2. Pass variables as arguments instead of using global variables.
3. Optimize the segment tree construction by using an iterative approach.
4. Optimize the range query by preprocessing the segment tree to store the gcd of each range.
5. Optimize the gcd calculations by using the Euclidean algorithm.
6. Optimize the binary search by using two pointers instead.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Replace macros with inline functions or constants:
   - Replace the `pb` macro with an inline function `push_back`.
   - Replace the `ppb` macro with an inline function `pop_back`.
   - Replace the `rep` macro with a range-based for loop.
   - Replace the `repr` macro with a range-based for loop.
   - Replace the `yes` macro with a constant string "YES\n".
   - Replace the `no` macro with a constant string "NO\n".
   - Replace the `dbg` macro with a function `debug` that prints the variable name and value.
   - Replace the `endl` macro with the newline character '\n'.
   - Replace the `F` macro with `first`.
   - Replace the `S` macro with `second`.
   - Replace the `mod` macro with a constant integer 1e9 + 7.
   - Replace the `INF` macro with a constant integer 1e18.
   - Remove the `N` macro.

2. Pass variables as arguments instead of using global variables:
   - Pass the `seg_tree` vector as an argument to the `build_tree` and `query` functions.
   - Pass the `a` array as an argument to the `build_tree` function.
   - Pass the `a` array as an argument to the `solve` function.

3. Optimize the segment tree construction by using an iterative approach:
   - Replace the recursive calls to `build_tree` with a loop that iterates over the tree indices from 1 to 2 * n.
   - Inside the loop, calculate the mid index as `(strt_i + end_i) / 2`.
   - Use the mid index to calculate the indices of the left and right child nodes.
   - Update the segment tree at the current index using the gcd of the left and right child nodes.

4. Optimize the range query by preprocessing the segment tree to store the gcd of each range:
   - Add a new parameter `gcd_tree` to the `build_tree` function to store the gcd of each range.
   - Initialize the gcd tree with the values from the input array.
   - Inside the loop in the `build_tree` function, update the gcd tree at the current index using the gcd of the left and right child nodes.

5. Optimize the gcd calculations by using the Euclidean algorithm:
   - Replace the calls to `__gcd` with a function `gcd` that implements the Euclidean algorithm.
   - The function takes two integers as arguments and returns their gcd.
   - Inside the function, use a while loop to repeatedly subtract the smaller number from the larger number until one of the numbers becomes zero.
   - Return the non-zero number as the gcd.

6. Optimize the binary search by using two pointers instead:
   - Replace the binary search loop with a loop that iterates while the left pointer is less than or equal to the right pointer.
   - Inside the loop, calculate the mid index as `(l + r) / 2`.
   - Use the mid index to calculate the gcd of the subarray from l to mid using the gcd tree.
   - Update the temporary variable and the count variable based on the gcd value.
   - Update the left or right pointer based on the gcd value.
