Code Analysis:
- The code uses several macros to define shortcuts for common operations or repetitive code snippets.
- The code builds a segment tree to efficiently compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of subarrays.
- The `build_tree` function recursively builds the segment tree by dividing the array into smaller segments and computing the GCD of each segment.
- The `query` function recursively queries the segment tree for the GCD of a given range.
- The `solve` function reads input, builds the segment tree, and iterates over each element of the array to find the longest subarray with GCD equal to the GCD of the entire array.
- The program uses the `__gcd` function from the `<bits/stdc++.h>` library to compute the GCD.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Avoid unnecessary memory usage:
   - The segment tree is currently stored as a vector of size `4 * N + 5`, where `N` is the maximum size of the input array. However, the actual size needed for the segment tree depends on the number of nodes in the tree, which is `2 * N - 1`. Therefore, we can reduce the size of the `seg_tree` vector to `2 * N` to save memory.

2. Optimize GCD computation:
   - The current code uses the `__gcd` function from the standard library to compute the GCD. However, this function has a time complexity of O(log(min(a, b))), where a and b are the input values. We can optimize this by implementing a more efficient GCD algorithm, such as the Euclidean algorithm, which has a time complexity of O(log(max(a, b))).
   - To implement the Euclidean algorithm, we can replace the `__gcd` function with a separate function that computes the GCD using the Euclidean algorithm. This will reduce the time complexity of GCD computation.

3. Optimize memory access:
   - The current code accesses the `a` array multiple times within the inner loop of the `solve` function. To improve memory access, we can store the value of `a[i]` in a separate variable before the loop and reuse that variable within the loop instead of accessing the array multiple times.

4. Compiler optimizations:
   - We can enable compiler optimizations to allow the compiler to apply various optimization techniques, such as loop unrolling or function inlining. This can be done by adding compiler-specific pragmas or command-line options to enable optimization flags.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Avoid unnecessary memory usage:
   - Reduce the size of the `seg_tree` vector from `4 * N + 5` to `2 * N`.

2. Optimize GCD computation:
   - Replace the `__gcd` function with a separate function that implements the Euclidean algorithm to compute the GCD.

3. Optimize memory access:
   - Store the value of `a[i]` in a separate variable before the loop in the `solve` function.

4. Compiler optimizations:
   - Add compiler-specific pragmas or command-line options to enable optimization flags.
