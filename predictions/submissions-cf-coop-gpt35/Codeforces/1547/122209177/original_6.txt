Analysis:
- The code uses a segment tree to efficiently compute the greatest common divisor (gcd) of subarrays.
- The segment tree is built using the `build_tree` function, which has a time complexity of O(n log n).
- The `query` function is used to find the gcd of a given range in the segment tree. It has a time complexity of O(log n).
- The `solve` function reads input, builds the segment tree, and performs the main computation. It has a time complexity of O(n^2 log n) due to the nested loops and the call to `query` inside the inner loop.
- The code also uses several macros and unnecessary includes (`<bits/stdc++.h>`) that should be removed.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Remove unnecessary includes and macros to improve code readability and reduce compilation time.
2. Optimize the `build_tree` function to improve memory usage and avoid unnecessary recursion.
3. Optimize the `query` function to avoid unnecessary recursion and improve performance.
4. Optimize the `solve` function to reduce time complexity and improve performance.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Remove unnecessary includes and macros:
   - Remove the `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` line and include specific headers as needed.
   - Remove unnecessary macros and replace them with their corresponding code. For example, replace `yes` and `no` macros with `cout << "YES\n"` and `cout << "NO\n"`.
   - Remove the `dbg` macro as it is not used.

2. Optimize the `build_tree` function:
   - Replace the global `seg_tree` vector with a local variable inside the `build_tree` function to reduce memory usage.
   - Instead of using recursion, use a loop to build the segment tree. This will improve performance by avoiding function calls and stack operations.
   - Update the `build_tree` function to take the segment tree vector as a parameter.

3. Optimize the `query` function:
   - Replace the global `seg_tree` vector with a local variable inside the `query` function to reduce memory usage.
   - Instead of using recursion, use a loop to traverse the segment tree. This will improve performance by avoiding function calls and stack operations.
   - Update the `query` function to take the segment tree vector as a parameter.

4. Optimize the `solve` function:
   - Remove the unnecessary loop that calculates the gcd of all elements in the array. This can be done as part of the main computation.
   - Replace the nested loops with a single loop to iterate over the array.
   - Instead of using binary search to find the range with gcd equal to `g`, update the range incrementally by checking the gcd of the current element with the previous range.
   - Use variables `left` and `right` to track the current range instead of `l` and `r`, to improve code readability.
