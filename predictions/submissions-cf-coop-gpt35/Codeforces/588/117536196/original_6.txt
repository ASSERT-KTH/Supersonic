The given code reads an integer `n` as input and then reads `n` pairs of integers `a` and `p` from the user. It calculates the minimum value of `p` and stores it in `m`. It then calculates the sum of `a * m` for each pair and stores it in `sum`. Finally, it prints the value of `sum`.

To optimize this code, we can focus on the following areas:

1. Avoid using `bits/stdc++.h`: The `bits/stdc++.h` header includes a lot of unnecessary headers, which can slow down compilation time. Instead, we can include only the necessary headers.

2. Avoid unnecessary memory usage: The variable `a` is declared as `short`, which uses 2 bytes of memory. Since the maximum value of `a` is not given, we can assume it to be within the range of an `int` (4 bytes). Therefore, we can change the type of `a` to `int` to avoid unnecessary memory usage.

3. Improve readability: The variable names `a`, `p`, `m`, and `sum` are not very descriptive. We can change them to more meaningful names to improve the readability of the code.

4. Optimize the loop: The loop can be optimized by using a pre-decrement loop instead of a post-decrement loop. This can avoid one unnecessary subtraction operation in each iteration.

5. Avoid unnecessary conditional checking in the loop: The loop checks if `n` is non-zero in each iteration. Instead, we can use a for loop with a decrementing counter to avoid the conditional check in each iteration.

6. Use `std::min` instead of conditional operator: The conditional operator `m = m > p ? p : m` can be replaced with `m = std::min(m, p)` to improve readability.

Here's the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>

int main() {
  int n;
  std::cin >> n;

  int amount, price, min_price = 101;
  long long total_sum = 0;

  for (int i = n; i > 0; --i) {
    std::cin >> amount >> price;
    min_price = std::min(min_price, price);
    total_sum += amount * min_price;
  }

  std::cout << total_sum;

  return 0;
}
```

This optimized code reduces unnecessary memory usage by changing the type of `a` from `short` to `int`. It also improves readability by using more meaningful variable names. The loop is optimized by using a pre-decrement loop and a `for` loop with a decrementing counter. The conditional operator is replaced with `std::min` for improved readability.
