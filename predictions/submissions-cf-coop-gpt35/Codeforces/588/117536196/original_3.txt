The given code is a simple program that reads an integer `n` from the user, and then reads `n` pairs of values `a` and `p`. For each pair, it calculates the product of `a` and the minimum value of `p` encountered so far, and adds it to the variable `sum`. Finally, it prints the value of `sum`.

Upon analyzing the code, I have identified a few areas where optimization can be applied to improve performance:

1. Input/Output Operations: The code uses `cin` and `cout` for input and output operations respectively. These operations are known to be slower compared to other methods like `scanf` and `printf`. We can replace `cin` and `cout` with `scanf` and `printf` respectively to improve the performance.

2. Unnecessary Header File: The code includes `<bits/stdc++.h>`, which is not a standard C++ header file. This header file includes all standard library header files, which can result in increased compile times. We should include only the necessary header files to reduce compilation time.

3. Data Types: The variables `a` and `p` are declared as `short`, which is a 16-bit signed integer. However, the values of `a` and `p` can be much larger than 16 bits. We should consider using a larger data type, such as `int`, to avoid potential overflow.

4. Loop Optimization: The code uses a `while` loop to iterate `n` times. However, using a `for` loop instead of a `while` loop can make the intent of the code clearer and potentially improve performance.

With these optimizations in mind, let's proceed with the step-by-step explanation and the optimized code.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int n;
  scanf("%d", &n);

  int a, p, m = 101;
  long long int sum = 0;
  
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    scanf("%d %d", &a, &p);
    m = min(m, p);
    sum += (a * m);
  }
  
  printf("%lld", sum);
  return 0;
}
```

Explanation of Optimizations:

1. Input/Output Operations: Replaced `cin` and `cout` with `scanf` and `printf`, respectively. This change improves the performance of input and output operations.

2. Unnecessary Header File: Removed the unnecessary header file `<bits/stdc++.h>`. It is not a standard C++ header file and includes unnecessary libraries, which can increase compilation time.

3. Data Types: Changed the data type of `a` and `p` from `short` to `int`. This change allows larger values to be stored without potential overflow.

4. Loop Optimization: Replaced the `while` loop with a `for` loop. Using a `for` loop makes the intent of the code clearer and reduces the chances of a mistake.

Trade-offs:

1. Input/Output Operations: The change from `cin` and `cout` to `scanf` and `printf` sacrifices some convenience for improved performance. However, the difference in performance is usually negligible for small input/output sizes.

2. Unnecessary Header File: Removing the unnecessary header file reduces compilation time and potentially improves build times. However, it might require including the necessary standard library headers explicitly.

3. Data Types: Changing the data type of `a` and `p` from `short` to `int` prevents potential overflow. However, it might increase memory usage slightly due to the larger size of the `int` data type.

4. Loop Optimization: Replacing the `while` loop with a `for` loop improves code readability and makes the intent of the code clearer. However, it does not have a significant impact on performance in this case.

Overall, these optimizations improve the performance of the code without sacrificing functionality or significantly increasing code complexity.
