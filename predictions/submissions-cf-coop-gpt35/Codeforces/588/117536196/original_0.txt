Upon analyzing the given code, a few potential areas for optimization can be identified:

1. Use of "bits/stdc++.h": This header includes the entire standard library, which can lead to longer compilation times. It is recommended to include only the necessary headers explicitly.

2. Use of "short" and "long int" datatypes: The code uses "short" to store the values of 'a' and 'p', and "long int" to store the sum. These datatypes might not be the most efficient for the given problem. We can consider using more appropriate datatypes based on the problem constraints.

3. Unnecessary use of ternary operator: The line `m = m > p ? p : m;` uses a ternary operator to update the value of 'm'. This can be simplified by using `m = min(m, p);`.

4. Usage of 'n--' in the while loop condition: Instead of using the pre-decrement operator 'n--' in the while loop condition, we can use a post-decrement operator 'n--' inside the loop. This will eliminate the need for an additional assignment.

To optimize the code, we can follow the following strategy:

1. Replace the "bits/stdc++.h" header with the specific required headers.
2. Analyze the constraints of the problem and select more suitable datatypes.
3. Replace the ternary operator with the 'min' function.
4. Modify the while loop to use the post-decrement operator.

Now, let's implement these optimizations step by step in the code block provided.
