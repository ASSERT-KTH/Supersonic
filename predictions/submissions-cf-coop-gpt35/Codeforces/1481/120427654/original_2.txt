The given code appears to solve a problem related to a tree structure. However, there are several areas where the code can be optimized for efficiency. Let's analyze each optimization opportunity step by step.

1. Redundant Header Inclusion:
    - The code includes the header `<bits/stdc++.h>`, which is a non-standard header and is not recommended for use in production code. It is better to include specific headers that are actually required.
    - The code also includes unnecessary headers `<ext/pb_ds/assoc_container.hpp>` and `<ext/pb_ds/tree_policy.hpp>`, but they are not used in the code. These headers can be removed.

2. Unnecessary Debug Output:
    - The code contains debug macros (`debug` and `debugs`) that print debug information to `cerr`. These macros are not used in the code and can be removed.

3. Compiler Optimization Pragmas:
    - The code includes compiler optimization pragmas (`#pragma GCC optimize`) and target pragmas (`#pragma GCC target`). These pragmas are compiler-specific and may not be supported by all compilers. It is recommended to remove these pragmas to ensure portability.

4. Inefficient Data Structures:
    - The code uses a 2D array `dp[BLOCK][NMAX]` to store dynamic programming values. However, the size of this array is unnecessarily large and can be reduced to optimize memory usage.
    - The code uses a `map<int, int>` to store frequencies of different levels. However, a simpler array-based approach can be used instead of a map to improve efficiency.

5. Redundant Computations:
    - The code computes the size of `lvl[i]` multiple times in the for loop `for (i = 1; i <= n; i++)`. This computation can be moved outside the loop to avoid redundant computations.

6. Inefficient Loop Iteration:
    - The code uses a while loop to find the last non-zero element in `dp` array. This can be optimized by using a for loop that starts from the last element of `dp` array and breaks as soon as a non-zero element is found.

7. Unnecessary Vector Copying:
    - The code creates a temporary vector `sol` to store the solution. However, this vector can be avoided by directly printing the solution while backtracking.

8. Improved Memory Usage:
    - The code uses a separate array `cul[NMAX]` to store the color of each node. However, this array is not required as the color can be determined on the fly while printing the solution.

Based on the above analysis, let's proceed with optimizing the code.
