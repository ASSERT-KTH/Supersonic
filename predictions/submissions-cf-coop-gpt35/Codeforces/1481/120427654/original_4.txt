The provided code is a C++ program that solves a problem related to assigning colors to nodes in a tree. The code uses a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm to traverse the tree and assign colors to the nodes based on certain conditions. The code then prints the assigned colors for each node.

To optimize this code, we can focus on the following areas:

1. Avoid unnecessary memory usage: The code currently uses several data structures such as vectors, maps, and arrays. We can analyze if these data structures are efficient for the given problem and consider using more optimized alternatives if necessary.

2. Reduce redundant computations: The code contains several loops and conditional statements that can be simplified or optimized to reduce redundant computations and improve performance.

3. Optimize the DFS algorithm: The depth-first search algorithm can potentially be optimized by eliminating unnecessary recursive calls or by using loop unrolling techniques.

4. Enable compiler optimizations: We can use compiler optimizations and pragma directives to hint the compiler to optimize certain parts of the code.

Now, let's go through each optimization step in detail:

1. Avoid unnecessary memory usage:
   - The code uses vectors (`vector<int>`) to store the adjacency list for each node. However, the maximum number of nodes is defined as `NMAX = 100001`, which seems excessive. We can consider reducing the maximum number of nodes to a more reasonable value or use a different data structure, such as an array, to store the adjacency list.
   - The code uses a map (`map<int, int>`) to store the count of nodes at each level (`mp`). Since the levels are integers, we can use an array instead of a map to store this information, which would be more memory-efficient.

2. Reduce redundant computations:
   - The code uses a depth variable (`depth`) to keep track of the maximum level/depth of the tree. However, this variable is not necessary, as we can determine the maximum level by using the size of the `lvl` vector. We can remove the `depth` variable and use `lvl.size()` instead.
   - The code calculates the size of `lvl[i]` in multiple places, which can be inefficient. We can calculate the size once and store it in a separate variable before using it multiple times.
   - The code uses a `for` loop to initialize the `l` map with `-1` values. Instead, we can use the `memset` function to initialize the memory block with `-1` values, which would be faster and more efficient.

3. Optimize the DFS algorithm:
   - The DFS algorithm can potentially be optimized by using tail recursion or loop unrolling techniques. However, before making any changes, we need to analyze if the DFS algorithm is a performance bottleneck in the given code and if optimization is necessary.

4. Enable compiler optimizations:
   - The code includes pragma directives (`#pragma GCC optimize`) to enable compiler optimizations. However, we need to analyze if these optimizations are necessary for the given code and if they provide any significant performance improvement.

Now, let's apply these optimization steps to the code:
