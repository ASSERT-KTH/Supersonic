Code Analysis:
1. The code uses a Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to generate prime numbers up to a given limit.
2. It then computes an array `ans` where `ans[i]` represents the count of prime numbers up to `i`.
3. The code reads an integer `t` from input, which represents the number of test cases.
4. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and calculates the count of prime numbers up to `n` using binary search on the `prime` array and the `ans` array.
5. It prints the result for each test case.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Remove unnecessary includes: The code includes the `bits/stdc++.h` header, which is not recommended as it includes all standard headers and can slow down compilation time. Instead, include only the necessary headers.
2. Use a smaller data type for the `prime` array: The `prime` array is currently defined as `int prime[maxn]`, where `maxn = 1e6 + 10`. However, since the array is used to store prime numbers, which are always positive, we can use a smaller data type such as `bool` to save memory.
3. Optimize the `euler` function: The `euler` function currently uses a sieve to generate prime numbers up to `n`. However, it can be optimized by:
   a. Starting the loop from 2 instead of 0, as 0 and 1 are not prime numbers.
   b. Using the `sqrt` function to limit the iteration to `sqrt(n)`. This is because any multiple of a number greater than its square root will have a corresponding factor smaller than the square root, which would have already been marked as composite.
   c. Using a `bool` array instead of `vis` array to save memory. The `bool` array can be initialized with `true` values and inverted to indicate prime numbers.
4. Optimize the calculation of `ans` array: The `ans` array can be calculated in a more efficient way by taking advantage of the fact that we are iterating over the prime numbers in increasing order. We can avoid unnecessary iterations by storing the previous count in a variable and updating it incrementally.
5. Optimize the binary search loop: The binary search loop can be optimized by making the following changes:
   a. Change `l + 1 < r` to `l <= r` to handle all possible values of `n`.
   b. Use the `mid` index directly instead of recalculating it in each iteration.
   c. Use `prime[mid]` instead of `(ll)prime[mid]` to avoid unnecessary type casting.
   d. Use `prime[l]` instead of `prime[l-1]` when calculating the result to avoid accessing out-of-bound memory.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Remove unnecessary includes:
   - Remove `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`.
   - Include only the necessary headers, such as `#include <cstdio>` for `printf` and `scanf` functions.
2. Use a smaller data type for the `prime` array:
   - Replace `int prime[maxn]` with `bool prime[maxn]` to save memory.
3. Optimize the `euler` function:
   - Change the loop in the `euler` function to start from 2 instead of 0.
   - Use the `sqrt` function to limit the iteration to `sqrt(n)`.
   - Replace `vis` array with `prime` array and initialize it with `true` values.
4. Optimize the calculation of `ans` array:
   - Initialize a variable `count` to 0 before the loop.
   - In each iteration, increment `count` if `prime[i]` is a prime number.
   - Update `ans[i]` using `ans[i-1] + (int)(!prime[i])`.
5. Optimize the binary search loop:
   - Change `l + 1 < r` to `l <= r` to handle all possible values of `n`.
   - Use `mid` index directly instead of recalculating it in each iteration.
   - Use `prime[mid]` instead of `(ll)prime[mid]` to avoid unnecessary type casting.
   - Use `prime[l]` instead of `prime[l-1]` when calculating the result.

The optimized code includes the suggested optimizations discussed above. The changes are minimal and focused on improving performance and reducing memory usage. The functionality and output of the original code are preserved.
