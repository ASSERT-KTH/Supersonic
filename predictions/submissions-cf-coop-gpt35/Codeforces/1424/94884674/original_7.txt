Optimization Strategy:

1. Replace the use of `bits/stdc++.h`: The inclusion of `bits/stdc++.h` brings in all the standard library headers and it can slow down the compilation process. Instead, include only the necessary headers that are required for the program.

2. Avoid unnecessary type definitions: The type definitions `ull` and `ll` are not used in the code. Remove them to reduce unnecessary code and improve readability.

3. Replace `memset` with `std::fill`: The `memset` function is used to initialize memory with a specific value. However, in this case, `std::fill` can be used with the `vis` array to achieve the same result in a more readable and efficient way.

4. Optimize the prime number calculation: The current implementation of the `euler` function calculates all prime numbers up to a given number `n`. However, the main program only needs prime numbers up to `maxn - 9`. We can optimize the `euler` function to only calculate prime numbers up to `maxn - 9` to save computation time and memory.

5. Optimize the calculation of the `ans` array: The `ans` array is calculated using the `vis` array. However, we can optimize this calculation by using a prefix sum approach. Instead of iterating through the `vis` array for each index, we can calculate the `ans` array in a single pass.

6. Use a binary search instead of linear search: The current implementation uses a linear search to find the index `l` such that `prime[l]` is the largest prime number less than or equal to `n`. We can optimize this by using a binary search, which has a time complexity of O(logN) instead of O(N).

7. Remove unnecessary type casting: The current implementation performs unnecessary type casting when calculating the answer. The `prime[mid]` and `n` variables are already of type `int`, so the type casting is not required.

8. Use a more efficient method for reading integers: The current implementation uses a custom `read` function to read integers from input. This function can be replaced with the standard `scanf` or `cin` functions for a more efficient and readable code.

Optimized Code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cstdio>
#include <cstring>

const int INF = 0x3f3f3f3f;
const double PI = acos(-1);
const double eps = 1e-8;

const int maxn = 1e6 + 10;
const int mod = 1e9 + 7;

int prime[maxn];
bool vis[maxn];
int ans[maxn];

void euler(int n) {
  std::fill(vis, vis + n, false);
  for (int i = 2; i < n; ++i) {
    if (!vis[i])
      prime[++prime[0]] = i;
    for (int j = 1; j <= prime[0] && i * prime[j] < n; ++j) {
      vis[i * prime[j]] = true;
      if (i % prime[j] == 0)
        break;
    }
  }
}

int main() {
  euler(maxn - 9);
  vis[1] = 1;
  
  // Calculate the ans array using prefix sum
  ans[0] = 0;
  for (int i = 1; i <= maxn; ++i)
    ans[i] = ans[i - 1] + (int)(!vis[i]);

  int t;
  scanf("%d", &t);
  while (t--) {
    int n;
    scanf("%d", &n);
    if (n <= 3) {
      printf("%d\n", n);
      continue;
    }
    int l = 1, r = prime[0];
    while (l + 1 < r) {
      int mid = (r + l) / 2;
      if (prime[mid] * prime[mid] <= n)
        l = mid;
      else
        r = mid;
    }
    printf("%d\n", ans[n] - ans[prime[l]] + 1);
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Explanation:

1. Removed the unnecessary inclusion of `bits/stdc++.h` and included only the necessary headers for the program.

2. Removed the unused type definitions `ull` and `ll`.

3. Replaced the use of `memset` with `std::fill` to initialize the `vis` array.

4. Changed the `euler` function to calculate prime numbers up to `maxn - 9` instead of `n`.

5. Optimized the calculation of the `ans` array using a prefix sum approach.

6. Replaced the linear search with a binary search to find the largest prime number less than or equal to `n`.

7. Removed unnecessary type casting when calculating the answer.

8. Replaced the custom `read` function with `scanf` for reading integers from input.
