The given code appears to be solving a problem that involves finding the number of distinct integers that can be formed by adding or subtracting 1 from the given array elements. 

Upon analyzing the code, the following potential optimizations can be identified:

1. Unnecessary Includes: The code includes the entire `bits/stdc++.h` header, which is not recommended since it slows down the compilation process and can lead to name clashes. Instead, only the required headers should be included.

2. Unnecessary Macros: The macros `el`, `PI`, `_test_`, `optimize()`, and `file()` do not seem to be used in the code and can be removed to simplify the code.

3. Redundant Function Definitions: The functions `gcd` and `lcm` are defined but not used in the code. These functions can be removed to reduce unnecessary function calls and improve performance.

4. Unnecessary Sorting: The array `a` is sorted using the `sort` function, but it is not clear why the sorting is necessary for the given problem. If sorting is not required, it can be removed to improve performance.

5. Unnecessary Sets and Maps: The set `s` and map `m` are used to store the distinct integers and their counts. However, it is not necessary to store the counts as the problem only requires finding the number of distinct integers. The set `s` can be used directly to store the distinct integers, eliminating the need for the map `m`.

6. Redundant If-Else Statements: The if-else statements inside the second for loop can be simplified by using a single if statement with three conditions. This will avoid unnecessary checks and improve performance.

Based on these observations, the following optimization steps can be proposed:

1. Remove unnecessary includes, macros, and function definitions.
2. Remove unnecessary sorting of the array.
3. Modify the second for loop to simplify the if-else statements.
4. Use only the set `s` to store distinct integers, eliminating the need for the map `m`.
