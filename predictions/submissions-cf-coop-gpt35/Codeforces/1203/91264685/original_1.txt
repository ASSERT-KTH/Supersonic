Code Analysis:

1. The code includes unnecessary header files such as `<bits/stdc++.h>`, which can slow down the compilation process. It is better to include only the necessary header files.
2. The code uses several global variables (`n`, `a`, `ans`, `k`, `s`, `m`), which can lead to confusion and make the code harder to optimize. It is better to encapsulate these variables within a class or function.
3. The code uses `set<int>` to store unique numbers and `map<int, int>` to track the occurrences of each number. However, using a `vector<bool>` or `bitset` can be more memory-efficient for tracking the occurrences.
4. The code uses a loop to read the input values and store them in the array `a`. However, using `std::vector` can provide more flexibility and better memory management.
5. The code sorts the array `a` using `std::sort` after reading the input values. Sorting the array is not necessary for the given problem statement.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Remove unnecessary header files and use only the necessary ones.
2. Encapsulate global variables within a class or function to improve code readability and maintainability.
3. Replace `set<int>` and `map<int, int>` with more memory-efficient data structures, such as `vector<bool>` or `bitset`, to track unique numbers and their occurrences.
4. Use `std::vector` instead of C-style arrays to improve memory management.
5. Remove unnecessary sorting of the array `a` to save time.

Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. Remove unnecessary header files and use only the necessary ones:
   - Remove the line `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`.
   - Include only the necessary headers, such as `<iostream>`, `<algorithm>`, `<vector>`, `<set>`, and `<map>`.

2. Encapsulate global variables within a class or function:
   - Create a class named `Solution` to encapsulate the global variables and functions.
   - Move the global variables `n`, `a`, `ans`, `k`, `s`, `m`, and the function `_case_()` inside the `Solution` class.

3. Replace `set<int>` and `map<int, int>` with more memory-efficient data structures:
   - Replace `set<int>` with `vector<bool>` or `bitset` to track unique numbers.
   - Replace `map<int, int>` with `vector<bool>` or `bitset` to track the occurrences of each number.

4. Use `std::vector` instead of C-style arrays:
   - Replace the C-style array `a[mx]` with `std::vector<int> a(n)` to improve memory management.
   - Update the code to use `std::vector` functions such as `push_back`, `size`, and `operator[]`.

5. Remove unnecessary sorting of the array `a`:
   - Remove the line `sort(a, a + n);` as sorting is not necessary for the given problem statement.
