The given code appears to find the number of distinct elements that can be formed by adding or subtracting 1 from each element in the input array. The code uses a set and a map to keep track of the distinct elements and their counts, respectively.

However, there are several potential areas for optimization in this code:

1. Unnecessary includes: The code includes the entire `<bits/stdc++.h>` header, which includes a large number of standard library headers. This can increase the compilation time and may include unnecessary dependencies. It is better to include only the required headers.

2. Unnecessary macros: The code defines macros for endl, PI, and file operations. These macros are not used in the provided code and can be removed.

3. Redundant functions: The code defines gcd and lcm functions, but they are not used in the provided code. These functions can be removed.

4. Inefficient data structures: The code uses a set and a map to keep track of distinct elements and their counts. However, using a set and a map together is redundant because a map can also store distinct elements and their counts. Using only a map can simplify the code.

5. Unoptimized loops: The code uses two separate loops to iterate over the array and insert elements into the set and the map. This can be optimized by combining both loops into a single loop.

6. Unoptimized sorting: The code uses the `sort()` function to sort the array. However, we only need to find distinct elements, so sorting the entire array is unnecessary. We can optimize the sorting step by using a more efficient sorting algorithm or by using a counting sort approach.
