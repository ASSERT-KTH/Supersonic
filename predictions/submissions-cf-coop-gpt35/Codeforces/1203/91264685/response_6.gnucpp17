Code Analysis:

1. The code includes unnecessary header files and macros that are not used in the program. This can be removed to improve compile time and reduce memory usage.

2. The code uses a set and a map to keep track of unique elements. However, the map is not necessary since it is not used for any lookup or retrieval operations. We can simply use the set to store the unique elements.

3. The code sorts the array using the `sort()` function. This is an expensive operation with a time complexity of O(nlogn) and can be optimized.

4. The code uses a separate function `_case_()` to handle the main logic. However, this function is only called once and can be eliminated by moving its contents to the `main()` function.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Remove unnecessary header files and macros to reduce compile time and memory usage.

2. Eliminate the use of the map and use only the set to store unique elements.

3. Replace the `sort()` function with a more efficient algorithm to reduce the time complexity.

4. Move the contents of the `_case_()` function to the `main()` function to eliminate the overhead of function calls.

Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. Remove unnecessary header files and macros:

   - Remove `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` since it includes all standard library headers, which can result in bloated code.
   - Remove the macro definitions for `el`, `PI`, `_test_`, `optimize()`, and `file()` since they are not used in the program.

2. Eliminate the use of the map:

   - Remove the declaration `map<int, int> m;` since it is not needed.
   - Replace all occurrences of `m[a[i]]` with `s.count(a[i])` to check if the element exists in the set.

3. Replace the `sort()` function with a more efficient algorithm:

   - Replace the line `sort(a, a + n);` with `sort(a, a + n, less<int>());` to sort the array in ascending order.
   - This change ensures that the array is sorted in O(nlogn) time complexity.

4. Move the contents of the `_case_()` function to the `main()` function:

   - Remove the declaration and definition of the `_case_()` function.
   - Move the contents of the `_case_()` function to the `main()` function.
