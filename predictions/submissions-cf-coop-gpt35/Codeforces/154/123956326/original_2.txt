The given code calculates the sum of occurrences of each value in the `adj` array. It does this by iterating over each element in the `adj` array, and for each element, it increments the corresponding value in the `mp` map. The sum of occurrences is stored in the `ans` variable. 

There are a few potential performance bottlenecks and inefficient memory usage in the given code:

1. The `map` data structure: The `map` data structure is used to store the occurrences of each value in the `adj` array. However, using a `map` can be inefficient in terms of memory usage and lookup time, especially when the number of distinct values in the `adj` array is large.

2. Unnecessary calculation of random values: The code generates random values using a random number generator (`rng`). However, these random values are not used in any meaningful way, as they are only added to the `val` array and then added to the corresponding elements in the `adj` array.

3. Redundant loop: The `solve` function is called twice with the same input. This means that the same calculations are performed twice, leading to unnecessary overhead.

To optimize the code, we can make the following changes:

1. Replace `map` with a more efficient data structure: Since we are only interested in counting occurrences, we can replace the `map` with a simple array. We can initialize an array of size `mxN` (maximum possible value in the `adj` array) with all elements set to 0. Then, for each element `x` in the `adj` array, we can increment the corresponding element in the array. This will provide a faster and more memory-efficient way to count occurrences.

2. Remove unnecessary calculation of random values: Since the random values are not used in any meaningful way, we can remove the code that generates and populates the `val` array.

3. Optimize the `solve` function: Instead of calling the `solve` function twice, we can modify it to accept the `adj` array as a parameter. This way, we can calculate the sum of occurrences in a single pass, eliminating the need for the second call to `solve`.

With these optimizations in mind, here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
#define ll long long
#define ar array
#define ull unsigned ll
mt19937_64 rng(chrono::steady_clock::now().time_since_epoch().count());
const int mxN = 1e6;
int n, m;
ull adj[mxN];
ll ans;

void solve(ull* adj) {
  int count[mxN] = {0}; // Array to count occurrences
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
    ans += count[adj[i]]++;
}

int main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(0);
  cin.tie(0);
  cin >> n >> m;
  for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
    int u, v;
    cin >> u >> v, --u, --v;
    adj[u] += adj[v]; // Removed unnecessary addition of random values
    adj[v] += adj[u];
  }
  solve(adj);
  cout << ans;
  return 0;
}
```

In this optimized code, we have replaced the `map` with an array `count` to count the occurrences of each value in the `adj` array. We have also removed the unnecessary calculation and population of the `val` array. Finally, we modified the `solve` function to accept the `adj` array as a parameter and calculate the sum of occurrences in a single pass.

These optimizations should improve the efficiency of the code by reducing memory usage and eliminating unnecessary calculations.
