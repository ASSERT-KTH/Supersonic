The given code calculates the value of `ans` by iterating over the `adj` array and maintaining a map `mp` to count the occurrences of each element in `adj`. The code uses a random number generator to initialize the `val` array and then performs some calculations on the `adj` array. Finally, it outputs the value of `ans`.

Upon analyzing the code, we can identify a few potential areas for optimization:

1. The use of `map` to count the occurrences of elements in `adj` could be replaced with a more efficient data structure. Since the values in `adj` are of type `ull`, we can use an unordered_map instead of a map to improve the lookup time from O(log n) to O(1).

2. The random number generator `rng` is being used to initialize the `val` array, but the values in `val` are only used for subsequent calculations on the `adj` array. We can optimize this by generating the random values directly during the calculation, eliminating the need for the `val` array.

3. The `solve` function is called twice, with the same input but different `adj` array values. We can optimize this by combining the two calls into a single loop, reducing the number of iterations.

4. The code currently includes unnecessary header files (`bits/stdc++.h`) and using namespace std, which can slow down the compilation process and result in potential name clashes. We can remove these to improve compile time and avoid potential issues.
