The provided code calculates a value `ans` by iterating over an array `adj`, and for each element `adj[i]`, it counts the number of occurrences of `adj[i]` in the array using a `map`. The code then outputs the final value of `ans`.

To optimize this code, we can focus on the following areas:

1. Avoid unnecessary computations:
   - The code calculates the hashing value `val` for each element in the `adj` array. However, this computation is not required for the initial iteration over the `adj` array. We can defer this computation until after the first iteration, reducing computation overhead.

2. Optimize data structures:
   - The code uses a `map` to count the occurrences of each element in the `adj` array. However, using a `map` involves additional memory overhead and lookup time. We can replace the `map` with a simple array to achieve constant-time lookup and reduce memory usage.

3. Utilize compiler optimizations:
   - We can use compiler optimizations, such as loop unrolling, to reduce loop overhead and improve performance.

Now, let's apply these optimization steps one by one:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
#define ll long long
#define ar array
#define ull unsigned ll
mt19937_64 rng(chrono::steady_clock::now().time_since_epoch().count());
const int mxN = 1e6;
int n, m;
ull val[mxN], adj[mxN];
ll ans;

void solve() {
  int count[mxN] = {0};  // Array to count occurrences of each element in adj
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
    ans += count[adj[i]]++;
}

int main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(0);
  cin.tie(0);
  cin >> n >> m;

  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
    cin >> val[i];  // Read val array directly from input

  for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
    int u, v;
    cin >> u >> v, --u, --v;
    adj[u] += val[v];
    adj[v] += val[u];
  }

  solve();

  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
    adj[i] += val[i];

  solve();

  cout << ans;
  return 0;
}
```

In the optimized code, we have replaced the `map` with an array `count` to count the occurrences of each element in the `adj` array. This reduces memory usage and improves lookup time.

Additionally, we have removed the unnecessary computation of `val` during the first iteration over the `adj` array. Instead, we read the `val` array directly from the input.

Finally, we have kept the rest of the code intact to preserve functionality and output.

Trade-offs:
- The optimized code introduces a new array `count` to store the occurrences of each element in the `adj` array. This increases memory usage, but the memory overhead is constant and proportional to the size of `adj`. Overall, this trade-off is acceptable considering the performance gain achieved by eliminating `map` operations.

Note: The `#define` statements and random number generation are not modified as they do not impact the performance of the code.
