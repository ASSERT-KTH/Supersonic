The given code calculates the value of the variable `ans` by iterating over the array `adj` and counting the number of occurrences of each element using a `map`. The code also performs some calculations on the arrays `val` and `adj` based on user input.

To optimize this code, we can focus on the following aspects:

1. Avoid unnecessary calculations: The code performs unnecessary calculations on the `val` and `adj` arrays. We can eliminate these calculations to improve performance.

2. Improve data structures: The code uses a `map` to count the occurrences of elements in the `adj` array. However, using a `map` can be inefficient in terms of both time and space complexity. We can use an array to count the occurrences instead, which will be more efficient.

3. Compiler optimizations: We can suggest some compiler optimizations or pragma directives to hint the compiler to optimize certain parts of the code.

Now, let's optimize the code step by step.

Step 1: Avoid unnecessary calculations on the `val` and `adj` arrays.
- The code calculates values for the `val` array using a random number generator. However, this calculation is not necessary for the given problem. We can remove the `val` array altogether.
- The code performs calculations on the `adj` array based on user input. However, we can perform these calculations directly on the `ans` variable to avoid the need for the `adj` array.

Step 2: Improve data structures by replacing the `map` with an array.
- Instead of using a `map` to count the occurrences of elements in the `adj` array, we can use an array to count the occurrences. This will be more efficient in terms of both time and space complexity.

Step 3: Compiler optimizations.
- We can suggest using compiler optimizations or pragma directives to hint the compiler to optimize certain parts of the code. However, since this code is relatively simple, the compiler should be able to optimize it without any additional directives.

Now, let's implement the optimized code.
