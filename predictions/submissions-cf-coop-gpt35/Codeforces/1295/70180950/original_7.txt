Code Analysis:
- The code is a solution to a problem which involves finding the minimum sum of two subarrays from an array.
- The code uses a segment tree data structure to efficiently compute the minimum sum of subarrays.
- The segment tree is built recursively in the `build` function.
- The `add_val` function updates the segment tree by adding a value to a range of elements.
- The `get_min` function retrieves the minimum value from a range of elements in the segment tree.
- The code uses an array `ps` to store the positions of elements in the array `p`.
- The code computes the answer by iterating over each element in the array `p`, updating the segment tree, and computing the minimum sum of subarrays using the `get_min` function.

Potential Optimizations:
1. Memory Usage Optimization:
- The `ps` array is not necessary and can be eliminated.
- Instead of using the `ps` array to store the positions of elements in the `p` array, we can directly compute the positions in the `build` function.
- This will save memory by eliminating the need for the `ps` array.

2. Loop Unrolling:
- The `add_val` and `get_min` functions are recursive, which can lead to function call overhead.
- We can optimize these functions by unrolling the recursion and using a loop instead.
- This will reduce the function call overhead and improve performance.

3. Compiler Optimizations:
- The `#pragma GCC optimize("Ofast")` directive is already used, which enables aggressive optimizations by the compiler.
- However, we can further optimize the code by suggesting other compiler optimizations or pragma directives.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Remove the `ps` array and compute the positions of elements in the `p` array directly in the `build` function.
2. Unroll the recursion in the `add_val` and `get_min` functions and use a loop instead.
3. Add additional compiler optimizations or pragma directives if necessary.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Remove the `ps` array and compute the positions of elements in the `p` array directly in the `build` function:
- In the `build` function, instead of using the `ps` array to store the positions of elements in the `p` array, we can compute the positions directly.
- This can be done by iterating over the `p` array and storing the positions in the `p` array itself.
- This eliminates the need for the `ps` array and saves memory.

2. Unroll the recursion in the `add_val` and `get_min` functions and use a loop instead:
- In the `add_val` and `get_min` functions, replace the recursive calls with a loop.
- This can be done by introducing a stack data structure to simulate the recursive calls.
- Instead of making recursive calls, we push the function arguments onto the stack and iterate until the stack is empty.
- This eliminates the function call overhead and improves performance.

3. Add additional compiler optimizations or pragma directives if necessary:
- Depending on the compiler used, additional compiler optimizations or pragma directives can be suggested to further optimize the code.
- These optimizations can include loop unrolling, function inlining, or vectorization, among others.
- The specific optimizations to suggest would depend on the target platform and the compiler being used.
