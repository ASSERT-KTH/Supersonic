Upon analyzing the provided code, I have identified several areas where optimization can be applied:

1. Redundant function calls: The `push()` function is called multiple times within the `add_val()` and `get_min()` functions. This can be optimized by moving the `push()` function call to the beginning of the `add_val()` and `get_min()` functions.

2. Redundant calculations: The `add_val()` function calculates `root->mid` multiple times. This calculation can be moved outside the recursive calls to avoid redundant calculations.

3. Memory allocation: The `build()` function recursively creates new nodes for each level of the tree. This can be optimized by using an array of nodes instead of dynamically allocating nodes for each level.

4. Unnecessary memory usage: The `ps` array is used to store the positions of elements in the `p` array. However, this information is only used during the `solve()` function and can be computed on the fly instead of storing it in a separate array.

5. Compiler optimization: The `#pragma GCC optimize("Ofast")` directive is used to enable compiler optimization. However, it is unclear what specific optimizations are intended. It would be beneficial to analyze the performance impact of different compiler optimization flags and choose the most appropriate ones.

Based on the above analysis, the following optimization strategy can be formulated:

1. Move the `push()` function call to the beginning of the `add_val()` and `get_min()` functions to avoid redundant function calls.

2. Move the `root->mid` calculation outside the recursive calls in the `add_val()` function to avoid redundant calculations.

3. Use an array of nodes instead of dynamically allocating nodes in the `build()` function to optimize memory allocation.

4. Compute the positions of elements in the `p` array on the fly instead of storing them in a separate array.

5. Analyze the performance impact of different compiler optimization flags and choose the most appropriate ones.

Now, let's proceed with the step-by-step explanation of each optimization step:
