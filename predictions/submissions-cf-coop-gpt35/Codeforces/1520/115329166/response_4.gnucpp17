Code Analysis:
1. The code includes unnecessary header files like <bits/stdc++.h> and <fstream>.
2. The code uses many macros that are not used in the program, such as FAST, ll, ll2, dob, mp, pi, pb, deb, deb2, deb3, ff, ss, forr, rfor, Vp, V, sort, rev, M, and fix.
3. The code uses a vector to store values for the left and right sides. However, these vectors are unnecessary since we only need to store the previous and next values for each position.
4. The code uses a loop to calculate the left and right values. This can be optimized by calculating the values in a single pass.
5. The code uses a loop to find the minimum value. This can be optimized by using the min_element function.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Remove unnecessary header files and macros.
2. Replace the vectors with variables for left and right values.
3. Calculate the left and right values in a single pass.
4. Use the min_element function to find the minimum value.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Remove unnecessary header files and macros.
- The <bits/stdc++.h> header file includes all standard library headers, which can increase compilation time and memory usage. We only need <iostream> for input and output operations, so we can remove the unnecessary header file.
- The <fstream> header file is not used in the code, so we can remove it.
- The macros are not used in the code, so we can remove them.

2. Replace the vectors with variables for left and right values.
- Instead of using vectors to store the left and right values, we can use variables since we only need the previous and next values for each position.

3. Calculate the left and right values in a single pass.
- Instead of using loops to calculate the left and right values separately, we can calculate them in a single pass. This can be done by keeping track of the number of stars encountered and updating the left and right values accordingly.

4. Use the min_element function to find the minimum value.
- Instead of using a loop to find the minimum value, we can use the min_element function from the algorithm library. This function returns an iterator pointing to the minimum element in a range, which can be dereferenced to get the minimum value.
