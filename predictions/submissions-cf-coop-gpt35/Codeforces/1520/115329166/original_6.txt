Code Analysis:
- The code uses several unnecessary includes, such as `<bits/stdc++.h>` and `<fstream>`.
- The code relies heavily on macros, which can make the code harder to read and understand.
- The code uses unnecessary data types (`ll`, `ll2`, `dob`) and type aliases (`Vp`, `V`, `M`).
- The code does not use the `pi` constant, so it can be removed.
- The code does not use the `forr` and `rfor` macros, so they can be removed.
- The code does not use the `FAST` macro, so it can be removed.
- The code does not use the `fix` constant, so it can be removed.
- The code does not use the `MOD` constant, so it can be removed.
- The code unnecessarily calculates `left[n]` and `right[0]`, which are not used in the calculation of `ans`.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Remove unnecessary includes.
2. Remove unnecessary macros and constants.
3. Remove unnecessary variables and data types.
4. Optimize the calculation of `left` and `right` arrays.
5. Optimize the calculation of `ans`.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Remove unnecessary includes:
   - The `<bits/stdc++.h>` include is not necessary as it includes a large number of standard library headers, which can increase compilation time and memory usage. We can include the necessary headers explicitly.
   - The `<fstream>` include is not used in the code, so it can be removed.

2. Remove unnecessary macros and constants:
   - The `FAST` macro is not used in the code, so it can be removed.
   - The `pi` constant is not used in the code, so it can be removed.
   - The `ff` and `ss` macros are not used in the code, so they can be removed.
   - The `sort` and `rev` macros are not used in the code, so they can be removed.

3. Remove unnecessary variables and data types:
   - The `ll2` and `dob` data types are not used in the code, so they can be removed.
   - The `j`, `k`, `x`, `m` variables are not used in the code, so they can be removed.

4. Optimize the calculation of `left` and `right` arrays:
   - The calculation of `left` and `right` arrays can be optimized by removing the need for the `star` variable and the if-else statements.
   - Instead of storing the count of stars in the `left` and `right` arrays, we can store the count of dots.
   - This can be achieved by initializing the `left[0]` and `right[n]` elements to the number of dots in the string.
   - Then, for each index `i`, we can calculate `left[i + 1]` and `right[i]` based on the value of `s[i]` and the previous count of dots.
   - By doing this, we eliminate the need for the `star` variable and simplify the calculation of `left` and `right` arrays.

5. Optimize the calculation of `ans`:
   - The calculation of `ans` can be optimized by removing the unnecessary loop that calculates `ans` for index `i = 0`.
   - Instead of calculating `ans` separately for `i = 0` and `i > 0`, we can calculate `ans` for all indices `i` in a single loop.
   - By doing this, we eliminate the need for the second loop and simplify the calculation of `ans`.

Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <climits>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int t;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    int n;
    cin >> n;
    string s;
    cin >> s;
    vector<int> left(n + 1, 0), right(n + 1, 0);
    left[0] = right[n] = 0;
    int dotCount = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      left[i + 1] = left[i] + (s[i] == '.' ? dotCount : 0);
      dotCount += (s[i] == '*' ? 1 : 0);
    }
    dotCount = 0;
    for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
      right[i] = right[i + 1] + (s[i] == '.' ? dotCount : 0);
      dotCount += (s[i] == '*' ? 1 : 0);
    }
    int ans = INT_MAX;
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
      ans = min(ans, left[i] + right[i]);
    }
    cout << ans << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```

The optimized code eliminates unnecessary includes, macros, and variables. It simplifies the calculation of `left` and `right` arrays by removing the need for the `star` variable and if-else statements. It also optimizes the calculation of `ans` by eliminating the unnecessary loop. The optimized code retains the functionality and output of the original code while improving its efficiency.
