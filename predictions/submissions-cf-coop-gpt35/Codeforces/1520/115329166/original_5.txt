Code Analysis:
1. The code includes several unnecessary header files, such as `<bits/stdc++.h>` and `<fstream>`, which are not used in the program. These should be removed to improve compilation time and reduce unnecessary memory usage.

2. The code uses several macros, such as `FAST` and `ll`, which are not necessary and can be replaced with their corresponding values. This will eliminate the need for macro expansion during compilation, leading to faster compilation and potentially smaller code size.

3. The code unnecessarily includes a large number of debugging statements (`deb`) that print the values of variables. These statements should be removed as they have a performance impact and are not necessary for the final optimized code.

4. The code uses a loop to calculate the values of the `left` and `right` vectors. This can be optimized to reduce the number of iterations and improve overall performance.

5. The code uses a vector of pairs (`Vp`) to store the values of `left` and `right`. This can be replaced with a more memory-efficient data structure, such as a single vector or an array.

6. The code uses the `min` function to calculate the minimum value of `ans`. This function call can be replaced with a simple comparison operation to improve performance.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Remove unnecessary header files: Remove the `<bits/stdc++.h>` and `<fstream>` header files, as they are not used in the code.

2. Replace macros with constants: Replace the macros `FAST`, `ll`, `ll2`, and `dob` with their corresponding values, such as `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0)` and `long long int`.

3. Remove debugging statements: Remove the `deb` statements that print the values of variables, as they are not necessary for the final optimized code.

4. Optimize the loop for calculating `left` and `right` vectors: Instead of using a loop, use a single pass to calculate the values of `left` and `right` vectors. This can be done by keeping track of the number of stars encountered so far and updating the `left` and `right` values accordingly.

5. Replace `Vp` with a more memory-efficient data structure: Replace the `Vp` vector of pairs with a single vector or an array to reduce memory usage.

6. Replace `min` function with a comparison operation: Replace the `min` function calls with a simple comparison operation to improve performance.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Remove unnecessary header files: Remove the `<bits/stdc++.h>` and `<fstream>` header files.

2. Replace macros with constants:
Replace the `FAST` macro with the following lines of code:
```cpp
ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0);
cin.tie(0);
cout.tie(0);
```
Replace the `ll`, `ll2`, and `dob` macros with the following lines of code:
```cpp
typedef long long int ll;
typedef int64_t ll2;
typedef double dob;
```

3. Remove debugging statements: Remove all the `deb` statements.

4. Optimize the loop for calculating `left` and `right` vectors:
Replace the loop for calculating `left` vector with the following code:
```cpp
ll star = 0;
for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
  if (s[i] == '.') {
    left[i + 1] = left[i] + star;
  } else {
    star++;
    left[i + 1] = left[i];
  }
}
```
Replace the loop for calculating `right` vector with the following code:
```cpp
star = 0;
for (i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
  if (s[i] == '.') {
    right[i] = right[i + 1] + star;
  } else {
    star++;
    right[i] = right[i + 1];
  }
}
```

5. Replace `Vp` with a more memory-efficient data structure:
Replace the `Vp` vector of pairs with a single vector or an array:
```cpp
vector<ll> left(n + 1, 0);
vector<ll> right(n + 1, 0);
```

6. Replace `min` function with a comparison operation:
Replace the `min` function calls with a simple comparison operation:
```cpp
ans = (left[i] + right[i] < ans) ? left[i] + right[i] : ans;
```

Optimized Code:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

typedef long long int ll;
typedef int64_t ll2;
typedef double dob;

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0);
  cin.tie(0);
  cout.tie(0);

  ll t = 1;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    string s;
    ll n;
    cin >> n;
    cin >> s;
    vector<ll> left(n + 1, 0);
    vector<ll> right(n + 1, 0);
    ll star = 0;
    for (ll i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      if (s[i] == '.') {
        left[i + 1] = left[i] + star;
      } else {
        star++;
        left[i + 1] = left[i];
      }
    }
    star = 0;
    for (ll i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
      if (s[i] == '.') {
        right[i] = right[i + 1] + star;
      } else {
        star++;
        right[i] = right[i + 1];
      }
    }
    ll ans = LLONG_MAX;
    for (ll i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
      ans = (left[i] + right[i] < ans) ? left[i] + right[i] : ans;
    }
    for (ll i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      ans = (left[i] + right[i - 1] < ans) ? left[i] + right[i - 1] : ans;
    }
    cout << ans << endl;
  }
}
```

The optimized code eliminates unnecessary header files, macros, and debugging statements. It optimizes the loop for calculating the `left` and `right` vectors and replaces the `Vp` vector of pairs with two separate vectors. It also replaces the `min` function calls with simple comparison operations. The optimized code retains the functionality and output of the original code while improving its performance and memory usage.
