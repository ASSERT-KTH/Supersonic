Upon analyzing the given code, there are a few potential areas for optimization:

1. Unnecessary Memory Usage: The code uses a vector of vectors (`g`) to represent a graph. However, the graph is represented as a tree, where each node has at most one parent. Therefore, we can optimize the memory usage by using a simple array instead of a vector of vectors.

2. Redundant Computation: The inner loop in the `solve` function calculates the number of children with no children of their own for each node. However, this computation can be simplified by keeping track of the number of children with no children of their own while building the graph.

3. Early Termination: The `solve` function continues iterating through the nodes even after determining that the condition `k < 3` is not satisfied. We can optimize this by adding an early termination condition to exit the loop as soon as the condition is not met.

Now, let's proceed with the optimization steps:

1. Unnecessary Memory Usage:
   - Replace the vector of vectors `g` with a simple array `parent` of size `n`.
   - Update the code to use `parent[i]` instead of `g[i]` and `parent[x]` instead of `g[x]`.
   - Initialize the `parent` array with -1 to indicate that a node has no parent.

2. Redundant Computation:
   - While building the graph, keep track of the number of children with no children of their own for each node.
   - Create an array `childlessCount` of size `n` and initialize it with 0.
   - When adding a child to a parent, increment the `childlessCount[parent]` if the child has no children of its own.

3. Early Termination:
   - Add an early termination condition inside the outer loop of the `solve` function.
   - If `k < 3`, return `answer(false)` immediately.

Here's the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

void answer(bool v) {
  constexpr const char *s[2] = {"No", "Yes"};
  std::cout << s[v] << '\n';
}

void solve(const std::vector<size_t>& parent, const std::vector<size_t>& childlessCount) {
  const size_t n = parent.size();
  for (size_t i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    if (parent[i] == -1)
      continue;
    unsigned k = childlessCount[i];
    if (k < 3)
      return answer(false);
  }
  answer(true);
}

int main() {
  size_t n;
  std::cin >> n;

  std::vector<size_t> parent(n, -1);
  std::vector<size_t> childlessCount(n, 0);

  for (size_t i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
    unsigned p;
    std::cin >> p;
    parent[i] = p - 1;
    childlessCount[p - 1] += childlessCount[i] == 0;
  }

  solve(parent, childlessCount);

  return 0;
}
```

This optimized code reduces memory usage by using a simple array instead of a vector of vectors. It also eliminates redundant computations by keeping track of the number of children with no children of their own while building the graph. Additionally, it includes an early termination condition to exit the loop as soon as the condition is not met.

The trade-off of these optimizations is increased code complexity, as we need to maintain the `parent` and `childlessCount` arrays. However, the performance gain from reducing memory usage and eliminating redundant computations should outweigh this trade-off.
