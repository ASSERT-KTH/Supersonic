Code Analysis:
- The code reads an integer t which represents the number of test cases.
- For each test case, it reads three integers n, l, and r, followed by an array of n integers.
- The code then counts the occurrences of each integer in the array and stores them in two maps, a and b, depending on whether the index is less than or equal to l or greater than l.
- It also keeps track of the distinct integers in the array using the unordered_set color.
- The code then iterates over the distinct integers and calculates the number of pairs that can be formed by selecting a certain number of elements from each map, based on certain conditions.
- Finally, it prints the answer for each test case.

Potential Performance Bottlenecks:
1. The use of `map<int, int>` for the variables a and b: Maps are implemented as binary search trees, which have a time complexity of O(log n) for insertion and retrieval. This can lead to slower performance, especially when dealing with large datasets.
2. The use of an unordered_set color to keep track of distinct integers: While unordered sets have an average time complexity of O(1) for insertion and retrieval, the code iterates over the set in the end, which can result in a performance hit for larger sets.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Replace the maps a and b with arrays to improve insertion and retrieval times.
2. Use a vector instead of an unordered_set to keep track of distinct integers for better iteration performance.
3. Optimize the loop that calculates the number of pairs by using integer division instead of modulo and multiplication.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Replace the maps a and b with arrays:
   - Maps have a higher memory overhead compared to arrays, and their insertion and retrieval times are slower.
   - Replace `map<int, int> a;` with `int a[N] = {0};` and `map<int, int> b;` with `int b[N] = {0};`.
   - This change will improve both memory usage and performance.

2. Replace the unordered_set color with a vector:
   - Iterating over a vector is faster than iterating over an unordered_set.
   - Replace `unordered_set<int> color;` with `vector<int> color;`.
   - Modify the section where color is populated as follows:
     - Instead of `color.insert(aux);`, use `if (find(color.begin(), color.end(), aux) == color.end()) color.push_back(aux);`.
     - This change will improve iteration performance.

3. Optimize the loop that calculates the number of pairs:
   - The current implementation calculates `a[x] / 2 * 2`, which is equivalent to `a[x] - a[x] % 2`.
   - Replace `int change = min(a[x] / 2 * 2, l - r);` with `int change = min(a[x] - a[x] % 2, l - r);`.
   - This change eliminates the unnecessary multiplication operation.

Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

#define readFast \
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); \
  cin.tie(0); \
  cout.tie(0);

#define fin cin

#define LSB(x) ((-x) & x)

const int N = 2e5 + 15;
const int MOD = 998244353;

int t;
int n, l, r, aux;
int a[N] = {0};
int b[N] = {0};
vector<int> color;

int main() {
  readFast;
  ifstream fin("date.in.txt");
  fin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    fin >> n >> l >> r;
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
      fin >> aux;
      if (i <= l) {
        ++a[aux];
      } else {
        ++b[aux];
      }
      if (find(color.begin(), color.end(), aux) == color.end()) {
        color.push_back(aux);
      }
    }
    for (int x : color) {
      int elim = min(a[x], b[x]);
      a[x] -= elim;
      l -= elim;
      b[x] -= elim;
      r -= elim;
    }
    if (l < r) {
      swap(l, r);
      swap(a, b);
    }
    int ans = 0;
    for (int x : color) {
      int change = min(a[x] - a[x] % 2, l - r);
      ans += change / 2;
      l -= change;
    }
    ans += (l - r) / 2 + (l + r) / 2;
    cout << ans << '\n';
    for (int x : color) {
      a[x] = 0;
      b[x] = 0;
    }
    color.clear();
  }
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized code improves performance by using arrays instead of maps and a vector instead of an unordered_set. It also optimizes the calculation of the number of pairs by eliminating unnecessary multiplication. The changes made preserve the functionality and output of the original code while reducing memory usage and improving running time.
