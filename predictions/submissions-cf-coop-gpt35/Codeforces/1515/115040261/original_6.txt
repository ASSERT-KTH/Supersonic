The provided code is a C++ program that reads input from a file and performs some calculations based on the input. The goal is to optimize the program for efficiency.

Upon analyzing the code, a few potential areas for optimization can be identified:

1. Use of unnecessary libraries: The code includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` library, which is not necessary and can slow down compilation times. It is recommended to include only the necessary libraries.

2. Excessive use of `map` and `unordered_set`: The program uses `map<int, int>` and `unordered_set<int>` to keep track of certain values. However, these data structures can be costly in terms of memory usage and lookup time. Consider using more efficient alternatives, such as arrays or vectors, if possible.

3. Redundant calculations: The code performs some unnecessary calculations, such as repeatedly subtracting the same value from variables. Identifying and eliminating these redundant calculations can improve performance.

4. Unoptimized loops: The loops in the code can potentially be optimized to reduce the number of iterations or improve cache locality. Techniques such as loop unrolling or loop interchange can be applied to optimize the loops.

Based on these observations, the following optimization strategy can be formulated:

1. Remove unnecessary libraries: Remove the unnecessary inclusion of `<bits/stdc++.h>`.

2. Replace `map` and `unordered_set` with more efficient alternatives: Replace the `map<int, int>` and `unordered_set<int>` with arrays or vectors to improve memory usage and lookup time.

3. Eliminate redundant calculations: Identify and eliminate any redundant calculations to improve performance.

4. Optimize loops: Apply loop optimizations techniques, such as loop unrolling or loop interchange, to improve performance.

Let's now proceed with the step-by-step explanation of each optimization and provide the optimized code.
