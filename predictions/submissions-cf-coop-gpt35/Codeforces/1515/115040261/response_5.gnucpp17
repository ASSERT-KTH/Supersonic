The given code appears to solve a problem involving counting and manipulating numbers. To optimize this code for efficiency, we can focus on the following areas:

1. Reducing Memory Usage:
   - The `map` data structures `a` and `b` are used to count the occurrences of numbers. However, since the numbers are limited in range, we can replace these maps with arrays to reduce memory usage.
   - The `unordered_set` `color` is used to keep track of unique numbers. We can replace this with an array as well since the range of numbers is known.

2. Minimizing Computation:
   - The loop `for (int x : color)` iterates over all unique numbers. However, it is unnecessary to iterate over all numbers in `color`. Instead, we can iterate over the numbers that exist in either `a` or `b`.

3. Compiler Optimizations:
   - We can enable compiler optimizations by using compiler-specific pragmas or flags. For example, we can use `-O3` flag for GCC to enable aggressive optimizations.
