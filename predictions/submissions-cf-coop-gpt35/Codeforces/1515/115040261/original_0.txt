Upon analyzing the provided code, the following potential performance bottlenecks and inefficient memory usage have been identified:

1. Unnecessary includes: The code includes the entire `bits/stdc++.h` library, which includes a large number of unnecessary headers. This can increase compilation time and memory usage.

2. Unoptimized I/O: The code uses `cin` and `cout` for I/O, which can be slower compared to other methods such as `scanf` and `printf`. Additionally, the `readFast` macro disables synchronization with `stdio`, which can lead to incorrect behavior when mixing `cin` and `scanf` calls.

3. Redundant data structures: The code uses both `map` and `unordered_set` to keep track of colors. However, since `color` is a subset of keys in `a` and `b`, it is unnecessary to use a separate data structure to store the colors.

4. Unnecessary memory allocations: The code uses a `map` to store the frequency of colors, which requires memory allocations for each insertion. This can be avoided by using an array instead.

5. Redundant loop: The code iterates over the `color` set to calculate the number of changes. However, this can be done during the previous loop itself, avoiding the need for a separate loop.

To optimize the code and address these issues, the following steps can be taken:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: Remove the `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` line and include only the necessary headers for the code.

2. Optimize I/O: Replace the `readFast` macro with the standard `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false)` and `cin.tie(0)` calls. Additionally, replace the `fin` input stream with `cin`.

3. Remove redundant data structures: Remove the `unordered_set<int> color` declaration and replace it with a `set<int>` declaration. This will ensure that the colors are stored in sorted order.

4. Replace `map` with array: Instead of using `map<int, int> a` and `map<int, int> b`, use `array<int, N> a` and `array<int, N> b`. This will avoid memory allocations and improve performance.

5. Combine loops: Combine the loop that calculates the frequency of colors and the loop that calculates the number of changes into a single loop. This will avoid the need for a separate loop over the `color` set.

Now, let's implement these optimizations in the code:
