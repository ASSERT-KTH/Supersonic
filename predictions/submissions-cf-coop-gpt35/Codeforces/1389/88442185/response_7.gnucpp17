The given code is a C++ program that solves a specific problem. However, there are several areas where the code can be optimized for efficiency:

1. Avoid unnecessary includes: The line `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` includes a large number of standard library headers, which can slow down compilation time. It is recommended to only include the necessary headers for the code.

2. Avoid using macros: The code uses macros for defining constants and loops. Macros can make the code harder to read and debug. It is better to use constant variables and standard loops (e.g., `for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)`) instead of macros.

3. Use `constexpr` for constant values: The code uses constants like `N` and `mod`. These values can be declared as `constexpr` variables instead of macros, which allows the compiler to optimize their usage.

4. Optimize the recursive function `f()`: The function `f()` uses recursion to solve the problem. However, this can be inefficient for large inputs because it results in repeated computations. The function can be optimized by using dynamic programming to avoid redundant computations.

5. Remove unnecessary global variables: The variable `lef` is a global variable that is used to keep track of whether the function is going left or right. This variable can be removed and handled within the `f()` function itself.

6. Optimize memory allocation: The code uses an array `dp[100001][6]` to store computed values. However, this array is much larger than necessary for the given problem. It can be optimized to use a smaller size based on the problem constraints.

7. Remove unnecessary input/output file handling: The code includes file handling for input and output files. This is not necessary for the optimization task and can be removed.

Based on these points, the following optimization strategy can be formulated:

1. Replace the unnecessary includes with the necessary ones.
2. Replace macros with constant variables and standard loops.
3. Use `constexpr` for constant values.
4. Optimize the recursive function `f()` using dynamic programming.
5. Remove the global variable `lef`.
6. Optimize memory allocation for the `dp` array.
7. Remove unnecessary file handling code.
