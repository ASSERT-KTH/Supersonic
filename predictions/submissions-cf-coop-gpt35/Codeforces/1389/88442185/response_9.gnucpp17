Code Analysis:
- The code uses a recursive function `f` to calculate the maximum possible sum of elements based on certain conditions and constraints.
- The code initializes a 2D array `dp` to store the calculated values of the function `f` to avoid redundant calculations.
- The code reads input from the user, including the number of test cases, the size of the array, and the values of the array.
- The code then calls the function `f` and prints the result.

Potential Performance Bottlenecks:
1. Recursive Function: The recursive function `f` is called multiple times with the same arguments, leading to redundant calculations. This can be optimized by storing the calculated values in the `dp` array.
2. Unnecessary Memory Usage: The `dp` array is initialized to all zeros using `memset` before each test case. This is unnecessary as the `dp` array is updated during the calculations. It can be avoided to reduce memory usage.
3. Unnecessary Global Variable: The global variable `lef` is used to keep track of whether the left recursion has already been performed. However, it is not necessary to use a global variable for this purpose. A local variable can be used instead.
4. Input/Output Redirection: The code includes directives to redirect input and output to files. This is not necessary for the optimization process and can be removed.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Replace Global Variable: Replace the global variable `lef` with a local variable in the `f` function.
2. Optimize Recursive Function: Modify the `f` function to use the `dp` array to store calculated values and avoid redundant calculations.
3. Remove Unnecessary Memory Initialization: Remove the `memset` function call to initialize the `dp` array as it is not required.
4. Remove Input/Output Redirection: Remove the directives to redirect input and output to files.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Replace Global Variable:
   - Replace the global variable `lef` with a local variable `leftRecursion` in the `f` function.
   - Update the `lef = false;` line to `leftRecursion = false;`.
   - Update the `lef = true;` line to `leftRecursion = true;`.
   - Update all occurrences of `lef` in the `f` function to `leftRecursion`.

2. Optimize Recursive Function:
   - Modify the `f` function to use the `dp` array to store calculated values and avoid redundant calculations.
   - Add a base case to return 0 when `k` is 0 or `i` is less than 0.
   - Check if the value is already calculated in the `dp` array using `dp[i][z]`.
   - If the value is already calculated, return it from the `dp` array.
   - Update the recursive calls to pass the updated values of `leftRecursion`, `left`, and `right`.
   - Store the calculated value in the `dp` array before returning it.

3. Remove Unnecessary Memory Initialization:
   - Remove the `memset(dp, 0, sizeof(dp));` line as it is not required.

4. Remove Input/Output Redirection:
   - Remove the directives to redirect input and output to files.
