Upon analyzing the given code, I have identified several potential areas for optimization:

1. Inefficient Memory Usage:
   - The `dp` array is declared as a global variable with a fixed size of 100001 x 6. However, the actual size required for each test case is determined by the values of `n`, `k`, and `z`. This inefficiently uses memory and can be optimized.

2. Redundant Computation:
   - The `f` function uses recursion to calculate the maximum sum. However, the current implementation involves redundant calculations, as the function is called multiple times with the same parameters. This can be optimized to avoid redundant computation.

3. Inefficient Looping:
   - The loops using the `rep` macro and `rep1` macro can be optimized. The `rep` macro is used to iterate a loop from 0 to `n`, while the `rep1` macro is used to iterate a loop from 1 to `b`. These macros can be replaced with standard `for` loops to improve performance.

4. Unnecessary Global Variables:
   - The `lef` variable is a global boolean variable that is used to keep track of whether the recursion is moving to the left or right. However, this variable is unnecessary, as it can be determined based on the value of `z`. Removing this variable will simplify the code and improve efficiency.

5. Compiler Optimizations:
   - Adding compiler optimizations or pragma directives can hint the compiler to optimize certain parts of the code. This can include flags like `-O3` for maximum optimization or specific `#pragma` directives.
