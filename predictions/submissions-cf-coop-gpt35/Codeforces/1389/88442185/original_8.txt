Code Analysis:
1. The code defines several macros for common operations and includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header, which includes all the standard C++ libraries. This can lead to increased compilation time and unnecessary memory usage.
2. The code uses a recursive function `f()` to calculate the maximum sum of elements based on certain conditions. However, the function makes redundant calculations and does not utilize dynamic programming effectively.
3. The code uses a 2D array `dp` to store computed values. However, the array is not efficiently used as it is not properly initialized and checked before accessing its elements.
4. The code reads input from the standard input stream and writes output to the standard output stream. It also includes file input/output operations when not running on an online judge.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Remove unnecessary macros and include only the required standard headers.
2. Refactor the recursive function `f()` to eliminate redundant calculations and utilize dynamic programming effectively.
3. Modify the data structures and algorithms to reduce memory usage and improve the overall efficiency.
4. Remove file input/output operations to avoid unnecessary overhead.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Remove unnecessary macros and include only the required standard headers.
   - Remove the macros `ll`, `N`, `mod`, `dd`, `rep`, `REP`, `rep1`, `pb`, `mp`, `F`, `S` as they are not used in the code.
   - Include only the necessary headers: `<iostream>`, `<cstring>`, and `<vector>`.
   - Remove the unnecessary `using namespace std;` directive.

2. Refactor the recursive function `f()` to eliminate redundant calculations and utilize dynamic programming effectively.
   - Initialize the `dp` array with all elements set to 0 before calculating the maximum sum.
   - Modify the function signature to take the array by reference instead of by value to avoid unnecessary copying.
   - Update the function to return the maximum sum instead of computing it recursively.
   - Remove the unnecessary `lef` flag and modify the logic accordingly.
   - Change the function name to `calculateMaxSum()` for clarity.

3. Modify the data structures and algorithms to reduce memory usage and improve the overall efficiency.
   - Change the type of the `arr` array from `int` to `vector<int>` to avoid potential buffer overflow.
   - Use a single-dimensional array `dp` instead of a 2D array to reduce memory usage.
   - Update the maximum size of the `dp` array to `n` instead of `100001` to match the input size.

4. Remove file input/output operations to avoid unnecessary overhead.
   - Comment out the `freopen` statements that open input and output files.
   - Remove the condition for printing the elapsed time.

Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cstring>
#include <vector>

long long int calculateMaxSum(int i, int k, int z, std::vector<int>& arr, std::vector<long long int>& dp) {
  if (k == 0 || i < 0)
    return 0;

  if (dp[i])
    return dp[i];

  long long int left = 0;
  long long int right = 0;

  if (z) {
    left = calculateMaxSum(i - 1, k - 1, z - 1, arr, dp);
  }

  right = calculateMaxSum(i + 1, k - 1, z, arr, dp);

  dp[i] = arr[i] + std::max(left, right);

  return dp[i];
}

int main() {
  std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  std::cin.tie(NULL);

  int t;
  std::cin >> t;

  while (t--) {
    int n, k, z;
    std::cin >> n >> k >> z;

    std::vector<long long int> dp(n);
    std::vector<int> arr(n);

    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      std::cin >> arr[i];
    }

    long long int ans = arr[0] + calculateMaxSum(1, k, z, arr, dp);

    std::cout << ans << std::endl;
  }

  return 0;
}
```

This optimized code reduces memory usage by using a single-dimensional array for dynamic programming. It also eliminates redundant calculations and improves code readability by refactoring the recursive function. The unnecessary macros and file input/output operations are removed to simplify the code.
