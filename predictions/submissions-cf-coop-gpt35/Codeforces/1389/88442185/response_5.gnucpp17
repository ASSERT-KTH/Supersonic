The given code appears to be solving a dynamic programming problem. However, it contains several areas that can be optimized for improved performance and reduced memory usage. 

1. Avoid using the `bits/stdc++.h` header: This header includes the entire standard library, which can slow down the compilation process. It is better to include only the necessary headers for the specific functionality used in the code.

2. Avoid using macros: Macros can make the code less readable and can lead to unexpected behavior. It is better to use constants or inline functions instead.

3. Avoid using global variables: The `lef` and `dp` variables are declared as global variables. Global variables can make the code harder to understand and maintain. It is better to pass them as parameters to the function or declare them locally within the main function.

4. Use `const` where appropriate: The `arr` parameter in the `f` function can be declared as `const int arr[]` since it is not modified within the function.

5. Avoid unnecessary recursion: The `f` function is implemented recursively, which can lead to excessive function calls and increased memory usage. It can be optimized by using a bottom-up iterative approach instead.

6. Optimize memory usage: The `dp` array is declared with a fixed size of 100001x6, regardless of the values of `n` and `z`. This can lead to unnecessary memory allocation. It is better to dynamically allocate the `dp` array based on the actual values of `n` and `z`.

7. Avoid unnecessary calculations: The `left` and `right` variables in the `f` function are assigned 0 by default but are not used when `k` is 0 or `i` is less than 0. It is unnecessary to assign values to these variables in those cases.

8. Avoid redundant calculations: The `max` function is called twice with the same arguments in the `dp[i][z]` assignment. It is better to calculate the maximum value once and store it in a variable for better performance.
