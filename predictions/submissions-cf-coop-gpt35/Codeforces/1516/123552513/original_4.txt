The provided code is a C++ program that solves a problem involving an array of integers. The program reads an integer `n` and an array `a` of size `n`, where each element of the array represents a value. The program then performs some calculations on the array and outputs either "YES" or "NO" based on a condition.

To optimize this code, we can focus on the following aspects:

1. Unnecessary includes: The code includes the entire `<bits/stdc++.h>` header, which is not recommended as it includes a large number of header files, leading to increased compilation time and potential namespace clashes. We can replace the unnecessary includes with the necessary ones.

2. Unused variables: The variables `pd`, `vi`, `vpl`, `vpd`, `vl`, `vd`, `vpi`, `db`, `pi` are not used in the code and can be removed.

3. Function templates: The function templates `ckmin` and `ckmax` are not used in the code and can be removed.

4. Redundant macros: The macros `M1` and `M2` are not used in the code and can be removed.

5. Unnecessary macros: The macro `dbg` is not used in the code and can be removed.

6. Unused constants: The constants `dx`, `dy`, `OO`, `MOD`, `MX` are not used in the code and can be removed.

7. Unnecessary variable initialization: The variable `k` is initialized to a fixed value of 2 but is never modified. We can remove the initialization and directly assign the value later.

8. Inefficient loop: The loop that calculates the XOR of all elements in the array and checks if it is equal to zero can be optimized. Instead of calculating the XOR of all elements in a separate loop, we can calculate it while reading the elements of the array.

9. Inefficient counting: The loop that counts the number of times `cur` becomes equal to `x` can be optimized. Instead of counting each occurrence of `cur` becoming equal to `x`, we can count the number of times `cur` becomes equal to `x` and immediately resets to 0.

10. Unnecessary library functions: The `bitset` library function for counting the number of set bits (`bits`) is not used in the code and can be removed.

Based on these observations, let's proceed with the optimization strategy.
