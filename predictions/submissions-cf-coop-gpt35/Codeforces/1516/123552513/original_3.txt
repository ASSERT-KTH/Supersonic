The given code appears to be a solution to a programming problem. It uses various C++ features such as templates, iterators, and standard libraries to solve the problem efficiently. However, there are several areas where the code can be optimized to improve its performance.

1. Unnecessary Includes: The code includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header, which is not a standard C++ header and is generally discouraged. This header includes all standard library headers, which can lead to increased compilation time and unnecessary code bloat. It is recommended to include only the necessary headers explicitly.

2. Redundant Macros: The code defines several macros (`M1`, `M2`, `re`, `pr`, `dbg`) that provide shortcuts for input/output operations. However, these macros add an additional level of indirection and can make the code harder to read and understand. It is recommended to avoid using macros and instead use regular function calls.

3. Inefficient Data Structures: The code uses several vector types (`vi`, `vl`, `vd`, `vpi`, `vpl`, `vpd`) to store collections of elements. However, these vectors are not necessary in the given code, as they are not used. It is recommended to remove these vector types to reduce unnecessary memory usage.

4. Inefficient Looping: The code uses range-based for loops (`each`) to iterate over the elements of a vector. However, this approach creates a copy of each element, which can be inefficient for large vectors. It is recommended to use regular for loops with indices to avoid unnecessary copying.

5. Inefficient Bit Operations: The code uses the `__builtin_popcount` and `__builtin_clz` functions to perform bit operations. These functions are compiler-specific and may not be efficient on all platforms. It is recommended to use standard C++ bit manipulation functions (`std::popcount`, `std::clz`) or bitwise operations (`&`, `|`, `^`, `<<`, `>>`) for better portability and performance.

6. Unnecessary Variable: The code defines the variable `k` but never uses it. It is recommended to remove this variable to improve code clarity.

To optimize the given code, we can follow these steps:

Step 1: Remove unnecessary includes and macros.

Step 2: Remove inefficient data structures.

Step 3: Replace range-based for loops with regular for loops.

Step 4: Replace `__builtin_popcount` and `__builtin_clz` with standard bit manipulation functions.

Step 5: Remove the unused variable `k`.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(NULL);
    
    int n;
    cin >> n;
    
    vector<long long> a(n);
    
    long long x = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        cin >> a[i];
        x ^= a[i];
    }
    
    if (x == 0) {
        cout << "YES\n";
        return 0;
    }
    
    int cnt = 0;
    long long cur = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        cur ^= a[i];
        if (cur == x) {
            cnt++;
            cur = 0;
        }
    }
    
    if (cnt & 1 && cnt > 2) {
        cout << "YES\n";
    } else {
        cout << "NO\n";
    }
    
    return 0;
}
```

This optimized code removes unnecessary includes, macros, and data structures. It replaces range-based for loops with regular for loops and replaces `__builtin_popcount` and `__builtin_clz` with standard bit manipulation operations. It also removes the unused variable `k` for improved code clarity. The optimized code preserves the functionality and output of the original code while improving its performance and reducing memory usage.
