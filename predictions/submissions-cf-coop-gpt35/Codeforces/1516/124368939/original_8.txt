The given code appears to be solving a problem using C++. However, there are several areas where optimization can be done to improve the performance of the code. Let's analyze and optimize the code step by step.

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The code includes `<bits/stdc++.h>` and `<ext/pb_ds/assoc_container.hpp>`, which are not necessary for this particular code. We can remove these includes.

2. Avoid using `using namespace std;`: It is generally considered a good practice to avoid using `using namespace std;` as it can cause naming conflicts. Instead, we can use the `std::` prefix for standard library functions and types.

3. Remove unnecessary macros: The code contains several unnecessary macros like `pb`, `pf`, `pob`, `pof`, etc. These macros can be removed as they are not used in the code.

4. Avoid using `vector<ll>` for small sizes: In the code, `vector<ll>` is used for storing `n` elements, where `n` is an integer. Using `vector` for such small sizes can result in unnecessary memory allocations and deallocations. Instead, we can use a simple array to store the elements.

5. Avoid unnecessary calculations in `phin` function: The `phin` function calculates the Euler's totient function for a given number `n`. However, there are some unnecessary calculations and checks in the code. For example, the code checks for divisibility by 2 twice and calculates `number` variable multiple times. We can optimize this function by removing these unnecessary calculations.

6. Use a more efficient prime sieve algorithm: The `sieve` function uses a simple sieve algorithm to generate prime numbers up to `n`. However, there are more efficient algorithms available, such as the Sieve of Eratosthenes. We can replace the existing sieve algorithm with a more efficient one.

7. Use `cout` and `cin` instead of `printf` and `scanf`: The code uses `printf` and `scanf` for input/output operations. However, `cout` and `cin` are generally faster and more efficient. We can replace `printf` and `scanf` with `cout` and `cin` for improved performance.

8. Remove unnecessary function calls: The code includes several unnecessary function calls like `modulo_pow`, `prefact`, `preinvfact`, `ncr`, etc. These functions are not used in the code and can be removed.

9. Optimize the loop for finding the answer: The code uses a loop to iterate over the elements of the array and check if a certain condition is satisfied. This loop can be optimized to reduce the number of iterations and improve performance.

Now, let's implement these optimizations in the code.
