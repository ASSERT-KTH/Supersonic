The given code implements a solution to a problem that involves inserting integers into a trie data structure and querying for the maximum xor value with a given integer. The code seems to be correct and functional, but there are several potential areas for optimization:

1. Memory allocation: The code uses a vector of vectors (`tr`) to represent the trie data structure. This can be memory-intensive, especially for large values of `mxn`. We can optimize this data structure to use a flat array instead of a vector of vectors.

2. Redundant computations: The code repeatedly computes the same values in the inner loops. We can eliminate these redundant computations by storing the intermediate values in variables.

3. Loop optimizations: The loop variables `i` and `p` are used in multiple loops. We can use loop unrolling to reduce the number of iterations.

4. Compiler optimizations: We can use compiler optimizations and pragmas to help the compiler optimize the code further.

I will now provide a step-by-step explanation of each optimization and then provide the optimized code.
