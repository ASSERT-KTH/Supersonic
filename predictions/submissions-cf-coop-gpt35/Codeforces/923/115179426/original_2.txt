The provided code is a C++ program that performs a prefix xor query on a given array. It uses a trie data structure to efficiently compute the xor prefix sum up to a given index.

Upon analyzing the code, the following potential performance bottlenecks and areas for optimization can be identified:

1. Memory Allocation: The code uses a 2D vector `tr` to represent the trie data structure. However, the size of this vector is fixed at `mxn` which is `32 * 3e5`. This means that a large amount of memory is allocated even if the actual number of nodes in the trie is much smaller. This can be optimized to reduce memory usage.

2. Redundant Computations: The code performs unnecessary computations in the `ins` and `qry` lambdas. The `cnt` vector is updated multiple times in each iteration of the loop, even though the value remains the same in each iteration. This can be optimized to reduce redundant computations.

3. Loop Optimization: The code uses a for loop with an index variable `i` to iterate over the bits of a number. This loop can be optimized using loop unrolling to reduce the number of iterations and improve performance.

Based on these observations, the following optimization strategy can be formulated:

1. Optimize Memory Allocation: Instead of using a fixed-size 2D vector, use a dynamically allocated trie data structure to reduce memory usage.

2. Eliminate Redundant Computations: Update the `cnt` vector only when necessary, avoiding unnecessary updates in each iteration of the loop.

3. Optimize the Loop: Unroll the loop that iterates over the bits of a number to reduce the number of iterations and improve performance.

Now, let's proceed with the step-by-step explanation of each optimization step:

1. Optimize Memory Allocation:
   - Replace the `vector<vector<long long>> tr(mxn, vector<long long>(2))` declaration with a dynamically allocated trie data structure.
   - The trie can be represented using a vector of pairs, where each pair contains the indices of the child nodes for the current node.
   - Use a vector to store the count of nodes instead of using the `cnt` vector.

2. Eliminate Redundant Computations:
   - In the `ins` lambda, update the `cnt` vector only when necessary. Check if the count of the child node is zero before incrementing the count.
   - In the `qry` lambda, update the `cnt` vector only when necessary. Check if the count of the child node is greater than zero before decrementing the count.

3. Optimize the Loop:
   - Unroll the loop that iterates over the bits of a number. Instead of using a loop from 30 to 0, manually iterate over each bit from the most significant bit to the least significant bit.

Based on these optimization steps, the optimized code is as follows:
