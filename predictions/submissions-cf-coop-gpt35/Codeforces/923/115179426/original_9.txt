The given code appears to be a solution to a problem that involves performing bitwise operations on a set of integers. However, there are several areas where the code can be optimized for improved efficiency. 

1. Avoid unnecessary includes: The `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` directive is a shortcut that includes many standard library headers. However, it is generally recommended to include only the necessary headers to minimize compilation time and reduce the size of the compiled binary.

2. Avoid using `using namespace std;`: While using `using namespace std;` allows for shorter code, it also brings all the names from the `std` namespace into the global namespace, which can lead to potential naming conflicts. It is considered a good practice to explicitly specify the namespace for each used identifier (e.g., `std::vector`, `std::cout`) to improve code readability and maintainability.

3. Avoid unnecessary vector initialization: The vector `tr` is initialized with 0 values, but this is not necessary since the values will be overwritten in the `ins` function. Removing this initialization can save some memory and reduce the initialization time.

4. Avoid using lambda functions: The code uses lambda functions `ins` and `qry` to encapsulate the logic for inserting and querying values in the trie. While this can improve code readability, it also incurs a small overhead for each function call. Instead, we can define separate functions for insert and query operations.

5. Optimize the trie construction: The current trie construction iterates over each bit of the input integer and performs multiple lookups and updates in the `tr` and `cnt` vectors. This can be optimized by using a single loop that iterates over each bit and performs the necessary operations directly on the `tr` and `cnt` vectors. This reduces the number of memory accesses and eliminates unnecessary conditional checks.

6. Optimize the query operation: The current query operation also iterates over each bit, performs multiple lookups and updates in the `tr` and `cnt` vectors, and keeps track of the result using a separate variable. This can be optimized by using a single loop that performs the necessary operations directly on the `tr` and `cnt` vectors, reducing the number of memory accesses and eliminating the need for a separate result variable.

7. Remove unnecessary decrement of `cnt[p]` before returning the result in the query operation: The `cnt[p]` value is decremented before returning the result, but this is not necessary since the decrement is already performed within the loop.

Based on these observations, let's proceed with optimizing the code step by step.
