The given code appears to implement a solution to a problem involving trie data structure. However, there are several areas within the code that can be optimized for better performance and memory usage. 

1. Unnecessary includes: The code includes the entire "bits/stdc++.h" library, which is not necessary for this program. It is recommended to include only the necessary libraries, such as <iostream> and <vector>.

2. Avoiding global variables: The code uses global variables for the trie data structure and the count array. It is generally better to avoid global variables and instead pass them as function arguments or use them as local variables.

3. Memory allocation: The trie data structure is implemented using a 2D vector of long long integers. However, it is not necessary to allocate memory for the entire trie structure up front. Instead, memory can be allocated dynamically as needed.

4. Redundant counting: The count array is used to keep track of the number of times each node in the trie is visited. However, this information is not used for anything other than checking if a node is visited or not. Therefore, it is not necessary to count the visits and instead, a boolean array can be used to indicate if a node is visited or not.

5. Avoiding lambda functions: The code uses lambda functions for insertion and query operations on the trie. While lambda functions can be convenient, they can also introduce some overhead compared to regular functions. It is recommended to convert the lambda functions into regular functions for better performance.

6. Compiler optimizations: The code can benefit from compiler optimizations. Adding compiler-specific pragmas or flags can hint the compiler to optimize the code further. However, it is important to note that compiler optimizations can vary depending on the compiler being used.

To optimize the code, the following steps can be taken:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: Remove the line "#include <bits/stdc++.h>". Replace it with the necessary includes, such as "#include <iostream>" and "#include <vector>".

2. Remove global variables: Remove the global variables "tr" and "cnt". Instead, pass them as function arguments or use them as local variables within functions.

3. Optimize memory allocation: Instead of allocating memory for the entire trie structure up front, allocate memory dynamically as needed. This can be achieved by using a vector of vectors, where each vector represents a level in the trie.

4. Use a boolean array to indicate visited nodes: Instead of counting the visits to each node, use a boolean array to indicate if a node is visited or not. This can reduce memory usage and improve performance.

5. Convert lambda functions into regular functions: Convert the lambda functions "ins" and "qry" into regular functions. This can improve performance by reducing the overhead introduced by lambda functions.

6. Apply compiler optimizations: Apply compiler-specific pragmas or flags to hint the compiler to optimize the code further. This can vary depending on the compiler being used.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

void insert(vector<vector<int>>& trie, vector<bool>& visited, int x) {
  int p = 1;
  visited[p] = true;
  for (int i = 30; i >= 0; --i) {
    int b = (x >> i) & 1;
    if (!visited[trie[p][b]]) {
      trie[p][b] = trie.size();
      trie.emplace_back(2, 0);
      visited.push_back(false);
    }
    p = trie[p][b];
    visited[p] = true;
  }
}

int query(vector<vector<int>>& trie, vector<bool>& visited, int x) {
  int p = 1;
  visited[p] = false;
  int res = 0;
  for (int i = 30; i >= 0; --i) {
    int b = (x >> i) & 1;
    if (visited[trie[p][b]]) {
      p = trie[p][b];
    } else {
      p = trie[p][!b];
      res += (1 << i);
    }
    visited[p] = false;
  }
  return res;
}

int main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(0);
  const int mxn = 32 * 3e5;
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  vector<int> a(n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    cin >> a[i];
  }
  vector<vector<int>> trie(2, vector<int>(2));
  vector<bool> visited(2, false);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    int b;
    cin >> b;
    insert(trie, visited, b);
  }
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    cout << query(trie, visited, a[i]) << ' ';
  }
  cout << '\n';
  return 0;
}
```

In this optimized code, unnecessary includes have been removed, global variables have been replaced with function arguments or local variables, memory allocation has been optimized by using a vector of vectors, and a boolean array is used to indicate visited nodes instead of counting visits. Lambda functions have been converted into regular functions for better performance. Compiler optimizations can be applied separately based on the compiler being used.
