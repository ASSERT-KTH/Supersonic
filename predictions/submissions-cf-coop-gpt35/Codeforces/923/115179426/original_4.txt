The given code appears to be implementing a trie data structure to perform bitwise XOR operations efficiently. However, there are several areas of potential optimization:

1. Use of `bits/stdc++.h`: This header includes a large number of unnecessary headers, which can slow down compilation time. It is better to include only the necessary headers explicitly.

2. Memory allocation: The code uses `vector<vector<long long>>` to represent a trie. This is not memory-efficient because it allocates a large amount of memory upfront, even for nodes that may not be used. A more memory-efficient alternative would be to use a single `vector<long long>` to represent the trie. Each node can be stored as a pair of two values: one for the left child and one for the right child.

3. Redundant increment of `cnt[p]`: In the `ins` function, there is an unnecessary increment of `cnt[p]` at the beginning of the loop. This can be removed to improve performance.

4. Unnecessary check of `cnt[tr[p][b]]` in `qry` function: The code checks if `cnt[tr[p][b]]` is greater than 0 before updating `p`. This check is unnecessary because the code increments `cnt[p]` before the loop and decrements it after the loop. So, it is guaranteed that `cnt[tr[p][b]]` will be greater than 0.

5. Improved loop structure: The loops in the code can be optimized by using a decrementing loop variable and precomputing the loop condition. This can improve performance by reducing the number of instructions executed in each iteration.

6. Compiler optimizations: The code can benefit from compiler optimizations. Adding compiler-specific pragmas or flags can help the compiler generate more efficient code.

Based on these observations, let's optimize the code step by step.
