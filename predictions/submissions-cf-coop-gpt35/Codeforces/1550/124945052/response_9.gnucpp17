Code Analysis:
- The code defines several macros and type aliases, which can make the code less readable and maintainable.
- The code imports the `bits/stdc++.h` header, which includes a large number of standard library headers. This can increase compilation time and may import unnecessary dependencies.
- The code uses a fixed-size array `mark` to keep track of the numbers that have been pushed to the `ans` vector. This array has a size of 5001, which is not necessary and can waste memory.
- The code uses a while loop to generate the `ans` vector. However, the loop condition could be simplified to `while (n > 0)` and the loop body can be optimized further.
- The loop condition `lastPush + 2 >= n` can be simplified to `lastPush >= n - 2`.
- The loop body first checks if `lastPush + 2 >= n`, and if true, pushes `n` to the `ans` vector. Then, it updates `lastPush` and `n`. This can be simplified to directly pushing `lastPush + 2` to the `ans` vector, and then updating `lastPush` and `n`.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Remove unnecessary macros and type aliases to improve code readability.
2. Replace the `bits/stdc++.h` header with the necessary standard library headers to reduce compilation time and dependencies.
3. Replace the fixed-size array `mark` with a more memory-efficient data structure.
4. Simplify the while loop condition and optimize the loop body to reduce unnecessary checks and computations.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Remove unnecessary macros and type aliases:
   - Remove the `#define` macros and replace them with explicit type declarations and functions where needed.
   - Remove the `using` directive for `minpq`.
   - Remove the unnecessary `mod` and `MAX_VALUE` constants.
   - Remove the `fi` and `se` macros and use `first` and `second` directly.
   - Remove the `vi` and `vl` type aliases and use `vector<int>` and `vector<ll>` directly.

2. Replace the `bits/stdc++.h` header with necessary standard library headers:
   - Include only the necessary standard library headers, such as `<iostream>`, `<vector>`, and `<algorithm>`.
   - Remove the `using namespace std` directive to avoid polluting the global namespace.

3. Replace the fixed-size array `mark` with a more memory-efficient data structure:
   - Since the maximum value of `n` is not known in advance, we can use a `unordered_set` instead of a fixed-size array to keep track of the numbers that have been pushed to the `ans` vector.
   - Replace the `mark` array declaration with `unordered_set<int> pushedNumbers`.

4. Simplify the while loop condition and optimize the loop body:
   - Change the while loop condition to `while (n > 0)`.
   - Inside the loop body, push `lastPush + 2` to the `ans` vector directly.
   - Update `lastPush` and `n` after pushing to the `ans` vector.
