The given code seems to generate a sequence of numbers and print the size of the sequence. The goal is to optimize this code for efficiency. 

Let's analyze the code to identify potential areas for optimization:

1. The code includes unnecessary header files. We should only include the necessary header files to reduce compilation time and memory usage.

2. The `using namespace std` directive is used, which can lead to namespace pollution and potential naming conflicts. It is recommended to avoid using this directive and explicitly specify the namespace when needed.

3. The `mark` array is initialized with a fixed size of 5001, even though it is only used up to index 1. This wastes memory. We can optimize this by initializing the array with a size of `n+1` instead.

4. The `ans` vector is used to store the sequence of numbers. We can optimize the memory usage by reserving the necessary capacity for the vector before starting the loop.

5. The loop in the `solve` function can be simplified. We can avoid the if-else condition and directly calculate the next number to be pushed into the vector.

6. The `gcd` function is not used in the given code and can be removed.

Based on these observations, we can outline an optimization strategy:

1. Remove unnecessary header files.
2. Remove the `using namespace std` directive.
3. Initialize the `mark` array with a size of `n+1` instead of a fixed size of 5001.
4. Reserve the necessary capacity for the `ans` vector before the loop.
5. Simplify the loop in the `solve` function.
6. Remove the unused `gcd` function.

Let's proceed with implementing these optimizations step by step:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

#define ll long long int

void solve() {
  ll n;
  std::cin >> n;
  std::vector<ll> ans;
  std::vector<int> mark(n + 1, 0);
  ans.reserve(n);
  ans.push_back(1);
  int lastPush = 1;
  while (n > 0) {
    lastPush += 2;
    if (lastPush >= n) {
      ans.push_back(n);
      n -= n;
    } else {
      ans.push_back(lastPush);
      n -= lastPush;
    }
  }
  std::cout << ans.size() << "\n";
}

int main() {
  int t;
  std::cin >> t;
  while (t-- > 0) {
    solve();
  }
  return 0;
}
```

In this optimized code:

1. Unnecessary header files have been removed.
2. The `using namespace std` directive has been removed.
3. The `mark` array is initialized with a size of `n+1`.
4. The `ans` vector reserves the necessary capacity before the loop.
5. The loop in the `solve` function has been simplified.
6. The unused `gcd` function has been removed.

These optimizations aim to reduce memory usage and improve code efficiency.
