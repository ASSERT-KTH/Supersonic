The given code is written in C++ and calculates the total number of triangles that can be formed using the given side lengths. However, there are several areas of improvement that can be made to optimize the code.

1. Unnecessary Header Files:
The code includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header file, which includes all the standard C++ library files. This can lead to increased compilation time and unnecessary memory usage. It is better to include only the necessary header files like `iostream`, `cmath`, and `vector`.

2. Redundant Typedefs:
The code contains several typedefs that are not used in the program. Removing these typedefs will make the code cleaner and improve readability.

3. Unused Macros:
There are several macros defined in the code that are not used. Removing these macros will simplify the code.

4. Unnecessary Inline Functions:
There are several inline functions defined in the code that are not used. Removing these functions will reduce code complexity.

5. Redundant Mathematical Functions:
The code includes several mathematical functions that are not used. Removing these functions will reduce code complexity.

6. Redundant I/O Operations:
The code uses `cout` and `cin` for input and output operations. However, these operations are slower compared to the standard C I/O functions like `printf` and `scanf`. Replacing `cin` with `scanf` and `cout` with `printf` can improve the I/O performance.

7. Magic Numbers:
The code uses several magic numbers like `120.0`, `180.0`, `2.0`, etc., which make the code less readable and harder to understand. It is better to use named constants or variables to improve code readability.

Based on these observations, the following optimizations can be made:

1. Remove unnecessary header files.
2. Remove redundant typedefs and macros.
3. Remove unused inline functions and mathematical functions.
4. Replace `cin` with `scanf` and `cout` with `printf`.
5. Replace magic numbers with named constants or variables.
