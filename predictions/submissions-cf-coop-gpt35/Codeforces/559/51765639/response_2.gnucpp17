After analyzing the provided code, several potential areas for optimization can be identified:

1. Unnecessary includes: The code includes all of the standard library headers using `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`. This is convenient but can result in including unnecessary headers, leading to increased compile time and larger object files. It is better to include only the necessary headers.

2. Redundant typedefs: The code uses typedefs for various data types (e.g., `typedef long long ll`, `typedef vector<int> vi`, etc.). These typedefs are not used in the code and can be removed.

3. Unused variables: The code declares several variables (`vvi`, `vvl`, `vii`, etc.) that are not used anywhere. These variables can be safely removed.

4. Function-like macros: The code uses several function-like macros (e.g., `PB`, `F`, `S`, `MP`, etc.) to define common operations. While these macros can improve code readability, they can also lead to potential issues such as unexpected side effects or naming conflicts. It is better to use inline functions or constants instead.

5. Unused functions: The code defines several inline functions (`EQ`, `isLeapYear`, `coDist`, etc.) that are not used. These functions can be safely removed.

6. Redundant calculations: The code performs some redundant calculations, such as repeatedly calculating the same values in the `TriangleAreaWithSide` function. These calculations can be optimized by storing the intermediate results in variables.

7. Magic numbers: The code uses several magic numbers (e.g., `120.0`, `180.0`, `2.0`, `1`) without any explanation. It is better to define these values as constants or variables with meaningful names to improve code readability.

Based on the above analysis, the following optimization steps can be proposed:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: Replace `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` with the necessary standard library headers that are actually used in the code.

2. Remove unused typedefs: Remove the typedefs that are not used in the code.

3. Remove unused variables: Remove the variables that are declared but not used in the code.

4. Replace function-like macros: Replace the function-like macros with inline functions or constants.

5. Remove unused functions: Remove the inline functions that are defined but not used in the code.

6. Optimize redundant calculations: Store the intermediate results of calculations in variables to avoid redundant calculations.

7. Define constants for magic numbers: Replace the magic numbers in the code with constants or variables with meaningful names.
