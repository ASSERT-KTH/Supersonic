Code Analysis:

1. The code includes a lot of unnecessary includes. Only the required headers should be included.
2. The code defines a lot of unnecessary typedefs and macros. These should be removed to improve code readability.
3. The code uses unnecessary functions like `isIntege`, `collinear`, `coDist`, `degreetoradian`, `equalTo`, `notEqual`, `lessThan`, `lessThanEqual`, `greaterThan`, `greaterThanEqual`. These functions can be removed as they are not used in the program.
4. The code includes a lot of unnecessary inline functions. These functions should be removed to simplify the code.
5. The code includes unnecessary operators like `<<` for printing vectors, sets, maps, etc. These should be removed to make the code cleaner.
6. The code defines unnecessary variables and arrays like `dx4`, `dy4`, `dx8`, `dy8`. These should be removed as they are not used in the program.
7. The code defines unnecessary variables and arrays like `eps`, `inf`, `infLL`, `MOD`. These should be removed as they are not used in the program.
8. The code includes unnecessary debugging functions like `dbg`, `faltu`, `timeStamp`. These should be removed as they are not used in the program.
9. The code should avoid using `using namespace std` as it pollutes the global namespace and can lead to naming conflicts. Instead, explicitly use the `std` namespace where required.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Remove unnecessary includes, typedefs, macros, and functions to simplify the code and improve readability.
2. Remove unnecessary variables and arrays to reduce memory usage.
3. Optimize the calculation of `x1`, `x2`, `x3` by removing unnecessary square roots and multiplications.
4. Optimize the calculation of `A1`, `A2`, `A3` by removing unnecessary divisions and multiplications.
5. Optimize the calculation of `A4` by using the formula for the area of a triangle given its side lengths.
6. Optimize the calculation of `ar` by using the formula for the area of an equilateral triangle.
7. Combine the calculation of `A1`, `A2`, `A3`, and `A4` into a single loop to reduce the number of calculations.
8. Use a more efficient algorithm to calculate the total number of triangles.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Remove unnecessary includes, typedefs, macros, and functions:
   - Remove unnecessary includes like `<bits/stdc++.h>`.
   - Remove unnecessary typedefs and macros like `typedef long long ll`, `#define PB push_back`.
   - Remove unnecessary functions like `isIntege`, `collinear`, `coDist`, `degreetoradian`, `equalTo`, `notEqual`, `lessThan`, `lessThanEqual`, `greaterThan`, `greaterThanEqual`.
   - Remove unnecessary operators like `<<` for printing vectors, sets, maps, etc.
   - Remove unnecessary variables and arrays like `dx4`, `dy4`, `dx8`, `dy8`, `eps`, `inf`, `infLL`, `MOD`.
   - Remove unnecessary debugging functions like `dbg`, `faltu`, `timeStamp`.
   - Avoid using `using namespace std` and explicitly use the `std` namespace where required.

2. Optimize the calculation of `x1`, `x2`, `x3`:
   - Instead of using `sqrt(sqr(a[0]) + sqr(a[1]) - (2.0 * a[0] * a[1] * cos(ang)))`, simplify it to `sqrt(sqr(a[0] - a[1]) + 4 * sqr(a[0]) * sin(ang / 2) * sin(ang / 2))`.
   - Similarly, simplify the calculation of `x2` and `x3` as well.

3. Optimize the calculation of `A1`, `A2`, `A3`:
   - Instead of using `((a[0] * a[1]) / 2) * sin(ang)`, simplify it to `(a[0] * a[1] * sin(ang)) / 2`.
   - Similarly, simplify the calculation of `A2` and `A3` as well.

4. Optimize the calculation of `A4`:
   - Instead of using `TriangleAreaWithSide(x1, x2, x3)`, calculate the area of the triangle directly using the formula `sqrt(s * (s - x1) * (s - x2) * (s - x3))`, where `s = (x1 + x2 + x3) / 2`.

5. Optimize the calculation of `ar`:
   - Instead of using `TriangleAreaWithSide(1, 1, 1)`, simplify it to `sqrt(3) / 4`.

6. Combine the calculation of `A1`, `A2`, `A3`, and `A4` into a single loop:
   - Instead of calculating each area separately, calculate them in a single loop and sum them up.

7. Use a more efficient algorithm to calculate the total number of triangles:
   - Instead of dividing the sum of areas by the area of an equilateral triangle, calculate the number of triangles directly by dividing the sum of areas by the area of a single triangle.
