Upon analyzing the given code, we can identify the following potential areas of improvement:

1. Unnecessary Includes: The code includes the entire `bits/stdc++.h` header, which is a non-standard header file and includes a large number of unnecessary headers. We should include only the necessary standard headers that are required for the code.

2. Redundant Typedefs: The code contains a large number of typedefs that are not used anywhere. These typedefs should be removed to reduce unnecessary code clutter.

3. Unnecessary Macros: The code contains several macros that are not used and can be removed to improve code readability.

4. Redundant Inline Functions: The code defines several inline functions that are not used and can be removed.

5. Unused Variables: The code declares several variables that are not used anywhere and can be removed.

6. Magic Constants: The code uses several magic constants like `120.0`, `180.0`, and `1.0` without any explanation. It is better to use named constants or variables instead of magic constants for better code readability.

7. Inefficient Trigonometric Computations: The code uses the `sin` and `cos` functions to compute the sine and cosine of the same angle multiple times. We can optimize this by computing the sine and cosine of the angle once and storing them in variables for reuse.

8. Redundant Square Root Computation: The code computes the square root of the same expression multiple times. We can optimize this by storing the result of the square root computation in a variable for reuse.

9. Unnecessary Precision Setting: The code sets the precision of the output to 10 decimal places using `cout.precision(10)`. Since the output is an integer, this precision setting is unnecessary and can be removed.

10. Non-Descriptive Variable Names: The code uses single-letter variable names like `a`, `x1`, `x2`, etc., which makes the code less readable. It is better to use more descriptive variable names to improve code clarity.

Based on these observations, we can formulate the following optimization strategy:

1. Remove unnecessary includes, typedefs, macros, inline functions, and unused variables.
2. Replace magic constants with named constants or variables.
3. Compute the sine and cosine of the angle once and store them in variables for reuse.
4. Optimize the square root computation by storing the result in a variable for reuse.
5. Remove unnecessary precision setting.
6. Replace single-letter variable names with more descriptive names.

Let's now implement these optimizations step by step in the code:
