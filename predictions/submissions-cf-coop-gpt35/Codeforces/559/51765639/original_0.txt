After analyzing the provided code, we can identify several areas where optimizations can be made:

1. Unnecessary includes: The code includes the entire `<bits/stdc++.h>` header, which is not only unnecessary but can also increase compilation time and memory usage. It is better to include only the necessary headers.

2. Redundant typedefs: The code includes several typedefs that are not used in the program. These typedefs can be removed to simplify the code and reduce memory usage.

3. Unnecessary macros: The code defines several macros that are not used. These macros can be removed to improve code readability and maintainability.

4. Unused functions: The code includes several inline functions that are not used in the program. These functions can be removed to reduce code complexity and improve compilation time.

5. Magic numbers: The code uses several magic numbers (e.g., 120.0, 180.0) without any explanation. It is better to define constants or use named variables to improve code readability.

6. Redundant calculations: The code performs several redundant calculations, such as calculating the square of a value multiple times. These calculations can be optimized to reduce the number of computations.

7. Redundant variables: The code declares and initializes several variables that are not used later in the program. These variables can be removed to reduce memory usage.

8. Unnecessary precision settings: The code sets the precision of the output to 10 decimal places, which might not be necessary. It is better to set the precision based on the requirements of the problem.

Based on these observations, we can formulate the following optimization strategy:

1. Remove unnecessary includes, typedefs, macros, and functions to simplify the code and reduce memory usage.

2. Define constants for magic numbers to improve code readability.

3. Optimize the calculations to reduce the number of computations and improve efficiency.

4. Remove unused variables to reduce memory usage.

5. Adjust the precision settings based on the problem requirements.

Now let's proceed with the step-by-step explanation and the optimized code.
