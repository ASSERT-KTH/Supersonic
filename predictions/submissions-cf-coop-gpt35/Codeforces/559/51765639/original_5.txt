Code Analysis:
- The code includes a lot of unnecessary header files that are not used in the program.
- The code defines a large number of typedefs and macros that are not used in the program.
- The code includes a lot of unnecessary inline functions that are not used in the program.
- The code includes a lot of unnecessary utility functions that are not used in the program.
- The code includes a lot of unnecessary debugging macros and functions that are not used in the program.
- The code includes a lot of unnecessary using statements that are not used in the program.
- The code uses the "bits/stdc++.h" header, which is not recommended as it includes all the standard C++ headers, leading to slower compilation times.
- The code uses unnecessary precision settings for cout.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Remove unnecessary header files: Remove the unnecessary header files that are not used in the program to reduce the compilation time.

2. Remove unnecessary typedefs and macros: Remove the unnecessary typedefs and macros that are not used in the program to reduce code complexity.

3. Remove unnecessary inline functions: Remove the unnecessary inline functions that are not used in the program to reduce code complexity.

4. Remove unnecessary utility functions: Remove the unnecessary utility functions that are not used in the program to reduce code complexity.

5. Remove unnecessary debugging macros and functions: Remove the unnecessary debugging macros and functions that are not used in the program to reduce code complexity.

6. Remove unnecessary using statements: Remove the unnecessary using statements that are not used in the program to reduce code complexity.

7. Replace "bits/stdc++.h" header with specific headers: Replace the "bits/stdc++.h" header with specific headers that are actually needed in the program to reduce compilation time.

8. Remove unnecessary precision settings for cout: Remove the unnecessary precision settings for cout to improve performance.
