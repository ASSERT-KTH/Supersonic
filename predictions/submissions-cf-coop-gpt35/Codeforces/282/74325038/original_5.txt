The given code reads a number `n` from the user and then reads `n` strings. It checks each string and updates the value of `s` based on the string's value. Finally, it prints the value of `s`.

Upon analyzing the code, we can identify a few potential optimizations:

1. Avoid unnecessary string comparisons: The code currently compares each string with four different values. However, we can simplify the logic by checking only the first character of each string. This avoids the need for string comparison and reduces the number of comparisons.

2. Minimize unnecessary string object creation: Currently, the code creates a new string object for each input string. Instead, we can directly check the character of the input string without creating a new string object.

3. Optimize the loop: The loop can be optimized by using a pre-increment or pre-decrement operator instead of addition or subtraction. This eliminates the need for an extra assignment operation.

4. Optimize input/output operations: The code currently uses `cin` and `cout` for input and output operations, respectively. These operations are relatively slow, especially for large inputs. We can use faster input/output functions like `scanf` and `printf` for better performance.

With these optimizations in mind, let's proceed with the step-by-step explanation and the optimized code.

Optimization Steps:
1. Replace the string comparisons with character comparisons: Instead of comparing the entire string, we will compare only the first character of the input string. This can be done by modifying the `if` conditions.

2. Update the loop logic: We will modify the loop by using a pre-increment or pre-decrement operator instead of addition or subtraction. This eliminates the need for an extra assignment operation.

3. Replace input/output operations: We will replace the `cin` and `cout` operations with faster input/output functions like `scanf` and `printf`.

Optimized Code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  int n, s = 0;
  scanf("%d", &n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    char c;
    scanf(" %c", &c); // read only the first character
    if (c == '+' || c == 'X') {
      ++s;
    } else {
      --s;
    }
  }
  printf("%d", s);
  return 0;
}
```

By implementing these optimizations, we have reduced the number of string comparisons, minimized unnecessary string object creation, optimized the loop, and replaced slow input/output operations. These changes result in improved performance and reduced memory usage.

Please note that the optimized code may seem slightly more complex due to the use of `scanf` and `printf` instead of `cin` and `cout`. However, the trade-off is improved performance and efficiency.
