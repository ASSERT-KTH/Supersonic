The given code reads a number `n` from the user and then reads `n` strings. For each string, it checks if it is `"++X"`, `"X++"`, `"--X"`, or `"X--"`, and increments or decrements the variable `s` accordingly. Finally, it prints the value of `s`.

To optimize this code, we can make the following changes:

1. **Avoid using `using namespace std`:** It is considered a good practice to avoid using `using namespace std` as it can lead to naming conflicts. Instead, we can use the `std::` prefix for standard library classes and functions.

2. **Avoid unnecessary string comparisons:**
   - Instead of comparing the input string with each possible value (`"++X"`, `"X++"`, `"--X"`, `"X--"`), we can compare only the first character of the string to `'+'` or `'-'`. This will eliminate unnecessary string comparisons and improve performance.
   - If the first character is `'+'`, we can check if the second character is `'+'` or `'-'`. Similarly, if the first character is `'-'`, we can check if the second character is `'-'` or `'+'`. This will further reduce the number of comparisons.

3. **Use a more efficient data structure for storing the input strings:**
   - Instead of storing each input string in a separate string object, we can store them in a `std::vector<char>` object. This will reduce the memory overhead of creating and managing multiple string objects.
   - We can iterate over the characters of the input string using an index variable, instead of using the string object's iterator. This will avoid the overhead of iterator initialization and comparison.

4. **Use a more efficient algorithm for updating `s`:**
   - Instead of using multiple `if` conditions to update `s`, we can use a single `if-else` condition to check if the first character is `'+'` or `'-'`. This will reduce the number of conditional branches and improve performance.
   - We can use a pre-increment or pre-decrement operator instead of adding or subtracting 1 from `s`. This will avoid the overhead of creating a temporary object for the addition or subtraction operation.

Based on these optimizations, here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

int main() {
    int n, s = 0;
    std::cin >> n;
    
    std::vector<char> inputStrings(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        std::cin >> inputStrings[i];
    }
    
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (inputStrings[i] == '+') {
            if (inputStrings[i + 1] == '+') {
                ++s;
            } else {
                --s;
            }
        } else if (inputStrings[i] == '-') {
            if (inputStrings[i + 1] == '-') {
                --s;
            } else {
                ++s;
            }
        }
    }
    
    std::cout << s;
    return 0;
}
```

This optimized code reduces the number of string comparisons, uses a more efficient data structure for storing the input strings, and uses a more efficient algorithm for updating `s`. These optimizations improve the code's performance and reduce memory usage.
