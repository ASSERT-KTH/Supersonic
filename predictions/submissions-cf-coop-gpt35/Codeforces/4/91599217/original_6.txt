The provided code is a simple program that reads a number `n` from the user, followed by `n` strings. It then checks if each string exists in a map called `db`. If the string is not found, it prints "OK" and adds the string to the map with a value of 1. If the string is found, it prints the string concatenated with its value in the map and increments the value.

To optimize this code, we can focus on the following areas:

1. Input/output operations: The code uses `cin` and `cout` for input and output. However, these operations can be slow, especially when dealing with large inputs or outputs. We can improve performance by using faster input and output methods.

2. Map operations: The code uses a `map` to store the strings and their counts. However, `map` has a relatively high memory overhead and can be slower compared to other data structures like `unordered_map` when the order of elements does not matter. We can switch to `unordered_map` to improve performance.

3. Redundant checks: The code uses `db.find(s) == db.end()` to check if a string exists in the map. This check is unnecessary because `unordered_map` provides the `count` function that can be used to check if an element exists. We can replace the `if` condition with `db.count(s) == 0` to improve efficiency.

4. Output string concatenation: The code uses string concatenation (`s + to_string(db[s]++)`) to form the output string. However, string concatenation can be inefficient due to memory reallocation and copying. We can optimize this by using `stringstream` to build the output string.

With these optimizations in mind, let's proceed with the step-by-step explanation and the optimized code.

Optimization Steps:

1. Replace `cin` and `cout` with `scanf` and `printf` respectively. This will improve the input/output performance.

2. Replace `map<string, int>` with `unordered_map<string, int>`. This will reduce memory overhead and improve performance for unordered access.

3. Replace `db.find(s) == db.end()` with `db.count(s) == 0`. This will simplify the check for string existence and improve efficiency.

4. Replace string concatenation with `stringstream` for building the output string. This will improve performance by avoiding unnecessary memory reallocation and copying.

Optimized Code:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <sstream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(0), cin.tie(0);
  int n;
  string s;
  scanf("%d", &n);
  unordered_map<string, int> db;
  while (n--) {
    cin >> s;
    if (db.count(s) == 0) {
      printf("OK\n");
      db[s] = 1;
    } else {
      stringstream ss;
      ss << s << db[s]++;
      printf("%s\n", ss.str().c_str());
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized code retains the functionality and output of the original code while improving performance and reducing memory usage. The changes made are minimal yet effective, resulting in a more efficient program.
