The provided code seems to be a C++ program that takes an integer `n` as input, followed by `n` strings. It then checks for duplicate strings and appends a number to each duplicate string to make them unique. The program uses an unordered map to store the strings and their counts. If a string is already present in the map, it appends the count to the string and prints it.

Upon analyzing the code, I have identified a few areas where optimization can be applied:

1. Input/Output Operations: The program uses `cin` and `cout` for input and output operations. These operations are slower compared to C-style input/output functions such as `scanf` and `printf`. By replacing `cin` and `cout` with their C-style counterparts, we can improve the performance of the program.

2. Unordered Map: The program uses an unordered map to store the strings and their counts. While this data structure provides constant-time average complexity for insertion and lookup, it has some overhead due to hash table operations. Since the program does not require constant-time lookup and only checks for duplicates, we can replace the unordered map with a set. This will reduce the memory usage and improve the performance.

3. String Concatenation: The program performs string concatenation using the `+` operator. However, string concatenation in C++ involves creating a temporary string object and copying the contents of the original string. This can be inefficient, especially when concatenating multiple strings. Using `stringstream` or `string.append()` can be more efficient alternatives.

4. Reserve and max_load_factor: The program uses `mp.reserve(1 << 18)` and `mp.max_load_factor(0.25)` to optimize the unordered map. While this can improve performance by reducing the number of rehashing operations, it is not necessary for our use case since we do not know the exact size of the input. We can remove these calls to simplify the code.

Now, let's implement these optimizations step by step:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  cout.tie(NULL);

  int n;
  scanf("%d", &n);

  set<string> uniqueStrings;
  while (n--) {
    char ar[20];
    scanf("%s", ar);
    string str(ar);

    auto it = uniqueStrings.find(str);
    if (it == uniqueStrings.end()) {
      printf("OK\n");
      uniqueStrings.insert(str);
    } else {
      printf("%s%d\n", ar, uniqueStrings.count(str));
      uniqueStrings.insert(str);
    }
  }
  
  return 0;
}
```

In this optimized code, I have made the following changes:

1. Replaced `cin` and `cout` with `scanf` and `printf` for input and output operations.
2. Changed the data structure from `unordered_map` to `set` to store unique strings only.
3. Replaced string concatenation with `printf` format strings to avoid unnecessary string operations.
4. Removed unnecessary calls to `mp.reserve(1 << 18)` and `mp.max_load_factor(0.25)`.

By implementing these optimizations, we can expect improved performance and reduced memory usage.
