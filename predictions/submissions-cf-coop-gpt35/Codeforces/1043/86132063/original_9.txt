This code appears to be solving a problem involving pairs of integers. It reads inputs `a` and `b`, creates and sorts a vector of pairs based on the difference between the second and first element, and then performs some calculations to determine the answer for each element in the vector.

However, there are several areas in this code that can be optimized for better performance. Let's analyze and optimize step by step.

1. Minimize unnecessary includes:
   - The code includes unnecessary headers, such as `<bits\stdc++.h>`, `<ext/pb_ds/assoc_container.hpp>`, and `<ext/pb_ds/tree_policy.hpp>`. These headers are not used in the code and can be removed.

2. Replace `using namespace std;` with specific using statements:
   - The code currently uses `using namespace std;` to avoid having to prepend `std::` to standard library functions and objects. However, this is considered bad practice as it pollutes the global namespace. Instead, it is recommended to use specific using statements for the required objects from the `std` namespace. For example, `using std::vector;` and `using std::pair;`.

3. Remove unnecessary definitions and macros:
   - The code defines several unnecessary macros, such as `int long long`, `endl`, and `dbg(a)`. These macros are not used in the code and can be removed.

4. Optimize input/output operations:
   - The code currently uses `cin` and `cout` for input/output operations. While convenient, these operations can be slower compared to other methods, such as using `scanf` and `printf`. Consider replacing `cin` and `cout` with `scanf` and `printf` for better performance.

5. Optimize sorting and searching:
   - The code uses `std::sort` to sort the `dif` vector and `std::upper_bound` to perform a binary search. Instead of using these standard library functions, consider implementing custom sorting and searching algorithms that are tailored to the specific requirements of the problem. This can potentially improve performance.

6. Optimize memory usage:
   - The code uses several vectors (`dif`, `pre`, `suf`, `v`, and `del`) to store intermediate values. However, some of these vectors are not necessary and can be eliminated to reduce memory usage. Additionally, the sizes of the vectors can be pre-allocated to avoid unnecessary resizing operations.

7. Optimize loop operations:
   - The code uses loops to perform calculations on vectors, such as `suf`, `pre`, and `del`. Consider optimizing these loops by unrolling them or using loop transformations to reduce the number of iterations and improve cache locality.

8. Use compiler optimizations:
   - Depending on the compiler being used, consider enabling compiler optimizations, such as using `-O2` or `-O3` flags. Compiler optimizations can often automatically optimize the code and generate more efficient machine code.

Now let's apply these optimizations to the code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

int main() {
    std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    std::cin.tie(NULL);
    std::cout.tie(NULL);

    int tc = 1, i, j, k;
    while (tc--) {
        int a, b;
        std::scanf("%d %d", &a, &b);
        std::vector<std::pair<int, int>> v(a);
        std::vector<int> suf(a), pre(a), del[a+1];

        for (i = 0; i < a; i++) {
            std::scanf("%d %d", &v[i].first, &v[i].second);
        }

        std::sort(v.begin(), v.end(), [](const auto& lhs, const auto& rhs) {
            return (lhs.second - lhs.first) < (rhs.second - rhs.first);
        });

        for (i = 0; i < a; i++) {
            suf[i] = v[i].second;
            if (i > 0) {
                suf[i] += suf[i - 1];
            }
        }

        for (i = a - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            pre[i] = v[i].first;
            if (i < a - 1) {
                pre[i] += pre[i + 1];
            }
        }

        for (i = 0; i < b; i++) {
            int x, y;
            std::scanf("%d %d", &x, &y);
            k = v[x - 1].second - v[x - 1].first;
            int m = v[y - 1].second - v[y - 1].first;
            if (m <= k) {
                del[x].push_back(v[x - 1].first + v[y - 1].second);
                del[y].push_back(v[x - 1].first + v[y - 1].second);
            } else {
                del[x].push_back(v[x - 1].second + v[y - 1].first);
                del[y].push_back(v[x - 1].second + v[y - 1].first);
            }

            k = static_cast<int>(del[x].size());
            if (k > 1) {
                del[x][k - 1] += del[x][k - 2];
            }

            k = static_cast<int>(del[y].size());
            if (k > 1) {
                del[y][k - 1] += del[y][k - 2];
            }
        }

        for (i = 0; i < a; i++) {
            int ans = 0;
            k = v[i].second - v[i].first;
            auto it = std::upper_bound(v.begin(), v.end(), k, [](int val, const auto& rhs) {
                return val < (rhs.second - rhs.first);
            });
            int idx = std::distance(v.begin(), it);

            if (idx - 1 >= 0) {
                ans = suf[idx - 1] + ((idx - 1) * v[i].first) - v[i].second;
            }

            if (idx < a) {
                ans += pre[idx] + (a - idx) * v[i].second;
            }

            if (!del[i + 1].empty()) {
                ans -= del[i + 1].back();
            }

            std::printf("%d\n", ans);
        }
    }

    return 0;
}
```
