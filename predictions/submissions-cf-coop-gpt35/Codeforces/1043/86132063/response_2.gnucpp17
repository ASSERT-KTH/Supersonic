The given code appears to be a solution to a problem involving calculations on a set of input values. However, the code contains some areas that could be optimized for improved performance and reduced memory usage. Let's analyze the code and propose optimizations step by step.

1. Avoid using unnecessary header files:
The code includes several unnecessary header files, such as `<bits\stdc++.h>`, `<ext/pb_ds/assoc_container.hpp>`, and `<ext/pb_ds/tree_policy.hpp>`. These headers are not used in the code and can be removed.

2. Remove unnecessary macros:
The code defines several macros (`int long long`, `endl`, `fast`, `line`, `dbg`, `infi`, `rinfi`, `inf`, `rinf`, `ff`, `ss`) that are not used in the code. These macros can be safely removed to simplify the code.

3. Optimize input/output operations:
The code uses `cin` and `cout` for input and output operations, respectively. However, these operations can be slow when dealing with a large number of inputs or outputs. To optimize this, we can use `scanf` and `printf` instead, which are faster alternatives.

4. Avoid using the `using namespace std` statement:
The code uses the `using namespace std` statement, which is generally considered bad practice as it pollutes the global namespace. It is better to use the `std::` prefix explicitly for standard library functions and types.

5. Optimize sorting and searching:
The code uses `std::sort` to sort the `dif` vector and `std::upper_bound` to search for an element in the `dif` vector. However, since `dif` is already sorted, we can use `std::lower_bound` instead of `std::upper_bound` to find the lower bound of an element in `dif`. This will avoid unnecessary comparisons and improve performance.

6. Optimize memory usage:
The code uses several vectors (`del`, `dif`, `pre`, `suf`, `v`) to store intermediate values. However, these vectors can be avoided by using variables to store intermediate values directly. This will reduce memory usage and improve performance.
