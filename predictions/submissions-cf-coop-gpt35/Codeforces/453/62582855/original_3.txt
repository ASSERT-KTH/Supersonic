The given code is a program that solves a dynamic programming problem. It takes an integer `N` as input, followed by a vector `a` of size `N`. The program finds a vector `b` of size `N` such that the sum of absolute differences between consecutive elements in `b` and `a` is minimized. The elements of `b` are selected from a set of prime numbers.

Upon analyzing the code, we can identify several potential areas for optimization:

1. Redundant includes: The code includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header, which is a non-standard and non-portable header that includes all standard C++ headers. This can lead to increased compile times and unnecessary memory usage. We can replace this with the specific headers that are actually used in the code.

2. Unnecessary macros: The code defines several macros, such as `pb`, `eb`, `mp`, etc., which are shorthand for various container operations. These macros can make the code less readable and may introduce unnecessary function call overhead. We can replace these macros with their corresponding function calls.

3. Excessive use of templates: The code uses templates extensively for various types, such as `vi`, `vvi`, `vll`, etc. While templates provide flexibility, they can also lead to increased code complexity and longer compile times. We can simplify the code by using specific types instead of template placeholders.

4. Inefficient data structures: The code uses vectors of pairs (`vvpii` and `vpii`) to store dynamic programming states. However, the use of pairs can be inefficient in terms of memory usage and cache locality. We can replace these vectors with more efficient data structures, such as arrays or structs.

5. Inefficient loop and conditional statements: The code uses nested for loops and conditional statements to iterate over the input and perform calculations. These loops and conditionals can be optimized by eliminating redundant operations and using more efficient loop constructs.

Based on these observations, we can formulate an optimization strategy to improve the performance of the code:

1. Replace the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header with specific headers used in the code, such as `<iostream>`, `<vector>`, `<algorithm>`, etc.

2. Replace the macros with their corresponding function calls. For example, replace `pb` with `push_back`, `mp` with `make_pair`, etc.

3. Replace the template placeholder types with specific types. For example, replace `vi` with `std::vector<int>`, `vvpii` with `std::vector<std::vector<std::pair<int, int>>>`, etc.

4. Replace the vectors of pairs (`vvpii` and `vpii`) with more efficient data structures, such as arrays or structs.

5. Optimize the loops and conditionals by eliminating redundant operations and using more efficient loop constructs, such as range-based for loops.

Let's now proceed with the step-by-step explanation and provide the optimized code block.
