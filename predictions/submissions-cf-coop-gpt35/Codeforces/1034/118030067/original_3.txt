Code Analysis:
- The code includes several unnecessary macros and typedefs that do not contribute to the performance of the program.
- The code includes an unnecessary bitset of size `maxN`, which is not used in the program.
- The code uses an unordered_map to count the factors of a number, which can be replaced with a simple array.
- The code includes unnecessary input/output functions and file handling that are not required for performance optimization.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Remove unnecessary macros and typedefs: Remove the unnecessary macros and typedefs to simplify the code and improve readability.
2. Remove unused bitset: Remove the unused bitset declaration and initialization to reduce memory usage.
3. Replace unordered_map with an array: Replace the unordered_map with a simple array to count the factors of a number. This will improve memory usage and reduce the overhead of the unordered_map.
4. Remove unnecessary input/output functions and file handling: Remove the unnecessary input/output functions and file handling code to simplify the program.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Remove unnecessary macros and typedefs: Remove the unnecessary macros and typedefs to simplify the code and improve readability. These macros and typedefs do not contribute to the performance of the program.
2. Remove unused bitset: Remove the unused bitset declaration and initialization to reduce memory usage. The bitset is not used in the program and is unnecessary.
3. Replace unordered_map with an array: Replace the unordered_map with a simple array to count the factors of a number. This will improve memory usage and reduce the overhead of the unordered_map. Instead of using `unordered_map<int, int> countOfFactors`, we can declare an array `int countOfFactors[maxN]` to count the factors.
4. Remove unnecessary input/output functions and file handling: Remove the unnecessary input/output functions and file handling code to simplify the program. These functions are not required for the performance optimization.

Optimized Code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <set>
#include <algorithm>
#include <cmath>
using namespace std;

int gcd(int x, int y) {
  return y ? gcd(y, x % y) : x;
}

void solve() {
  const int maxN = 15000007;
  int spf[maxN] = {0};
  int countOfFactors[maxN] = {0};

  spf[0] = spf[1] = 0;
  for (int i = 2; i < maxN; i++) {
    spf[i] = i;
  }
  for (int i = 2; i < maxN; i++) {
    if (spf[i] == i) {
      for (int j = i * i; j < maxN; j += i) {
        if (spf[j] == j) {
          spf[j] = i;
        }
      }
    }
  }

  int n;
  cin >> n;
  vector<int> v(n);
  int gcdIs = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> v[i];
    gcdIs = gcd(gcdIs, v[i]);
  }
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    v[i] /= gcdIs;
  }
  for (int eleInArray : v) {
    int n = eleInArray;
    set<int> primeFactors;
    while (n != 1) {
      primeFactors.insert(spf[n]);
      n /= spf[n];
    }
    for (int i : primeFactors) {
      countOfFactors[i]++;
    }
  }
  int keep = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < maxN; i++) {
    keep = max(keep, countOfFactors[i]);
  }
  keep ? (cout << n - keep) : (cout << "-1");
}

int main() {
  solve();
  return 0;
}
```

The optimized code removes unnecessary macros, typedefs, and input/output functions. It replaces the unordered_map with a simple array to count the factors of a number. The unused bitset is removed to reduce memory usage. The overall code is simplified and more efficient in terms of time and memory.
