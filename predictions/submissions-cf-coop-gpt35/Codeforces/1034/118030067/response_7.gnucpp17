Code Analysis:
- The code includes various unnecessary macros, such as `cont`, `EPS`, `INF`, and `isPowOfTwo`, which are not used in the code and can be removed.
- The code includes unnecessary headers, such as `<bits/stdc++.h>`, which is not recommended and can be replaced with specific headers.
- The code uses a lot of unnecessary global variables and macros, which can be avoided to improve code readability and maintainability.
- The code uses unnecessary data structures, such as `unordered_map<int, int> countOfFactors`, which can be replaced with a vector to improve memory usage and reduce lookup time.
- The code includes redundant calculations, such as repeatedly calculating the gcd of elements in the array and dividing each element by the gcd, which can be optimized.
- The code includes unnecessary loops, such as the loop in the `solve()` function to divide each element by the gcd, which can be avoided.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Remove unnecessary macros: Remove the unnecessary macros `cont`, `EPS`, `INF`, and `isPowOfTwo` from the code.
2. Replace unnecessary headers: Replace the header `<bits/stdc++.h>` with specific headers that are required for the code, such as `<iostream>`, `<vector>`, `<set>`, `<map>`, `<bitset>`, and `<unordered_map>`.
3. Remove unnecessary global variables and macros: Remove the unnecessary global variables `spf`, `countOfFactors`, and `primes`. Replace the macros `maxN` and `sieve` with constants.
4. Replace `unordered_map` with a vector: Replace the `unordered_map<int, int> countOfFactors` with a `vector<int>` to store the count of factors.
5. Optimize gcd calculation: Instead of repeatedly calculating the gcd of elements in the array, calculate the gcd only once using the `gcd` function and divide each element by the gcd in a single loop.
6. Optimize factorization: Instead of using a set to store prime factors, directly increment the count of factors in the vector. This eliminates the need for the set and reduces memory usage.
7. Remove unnecessary loops: Remove the loop that divides each element by the gcd in the `solve()` function.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Remove unnecessary macros: Remove the unnecessary macros `cont`, `EPS`, `INF`, and `isPowOfTwo` from the code. These macros are not used and add unnecessary complexity to the code.
2. Replace unnecessary headers: Replace the header `<bits/stdc++.h>` with specific headers that are required for the code, such as `<iostream>`, `<vector>`, `<set>`, `<map>`, `<bitset>`, and `<unordered_map>`. This improves code readability and reduces the compilation time.
3. Remove unnecessary global variables and macros: Remove the unnecessary global variables `spf`, `countOfFactors`, and `primes`. Replace the macros `maxN` and `sieve` with constants. This reduces memory usage and improves code maintainability.
4. Replace `unordered_map` with a vector: Replace the `unordered_map<int, int> countOfFactors` with a `vector<int> countOfFactors` to store the count of factors. This reduces memory usage and improves lookup time.
5. Optimize gcd calculation: Instead of repeatedly calculating the gcd of elements in the array, calculate the gcd only once using the `gcd` function and divide each element by the gcd in a single loop. This reduces the number of gcd calculations and improves performance.
6. Optimize factorization: Instead of using a set to store prime factors, directly increment the count of factors in the vector. This eliminates the need for the set and reduces memory usage. This also improves performance by reducing the number of iterations.
7. Remove unnecessary loops: Remove the loop that divides each element by the gcd in the `solve()` function. Since we have already divided each element by the gcd in the previous step, this loop is no longer needed.
