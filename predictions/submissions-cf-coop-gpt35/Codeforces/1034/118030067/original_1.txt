The given code appears to be implementing a program to find the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from an array such that the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the remaining elements is equal to 1. The code uses a sieve to generate prime numbers up to a given limit and then factors each element of the array to determine the count of prime factors.

Upon analyzing the code, the following potential performance bottlenecks and areas for optimization are identified:

1. Unnecessary macros: The code includes several macros that might not be necessary, such as `cont`, `ff`, `ss`, `pb`, `ins`, `mp`, `EPS`, `INF`, and `steps`. These macros increase the code size and might hinder code readability. It is recommended to remove these macros and use the corresponding statements directly in the code.

2. Redundant functions: The code defines two functions `gcd` and `fio` that are not used in the program. These functions should be removed to improve code clarity and avoid unnecessary function calls.

3. Excessive use of `std` namespace: The code includes a blanket `using namespace std;`. This practice is generally discouraged, as it can lead to naming conflicts and make the code less maintainable. It is recommended to use explicit namespace declarations (`using std::vector;`, `using std::set;`, etc.) to improve code readability.

4. Excessive data structure copying: The code repeatedly copies the `v` vector into the `countOfFactors` unordered map. This can be optimized by passing the vector by reference instead of making a copy.

5. Inefficient data structures: The code uses an unordered map `countOfFactors` to store the count of prime factors. However, since the prime factors are known to be small integers, an array-based count could be more efficient.

Based on these observations, the following optimization strategy is proposed:

1. Remove unnecessary macros: Remove the unnecessary macros to improve code readability and reduce clutter.

2. Remove redundant functions: Remove the unused `gcd` and `fio` functions to eliminate unnecessary function calls.

3. Remove excessive use of `std` namespace: Replace the blanket `using namespace std;` with explicit `using` statements for specific namespaces to avoid potential naming conflicts.

4. Pass vector by reference: Modify the `factorize` function to accept the vector by reference instead of making a copy. This avoids unnecessary copying of the vector.

5. Replace unordered map with an array: Replace the `unordered_map<int, int> countOfFactors` with an array-based count to store the count of prime factors. Since the prime factors are small integers, this approach will be more memory-efficient and faster.

With these optimizations in mind, the optimized code is presented below:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <set>
#include <algorithm>
#include <bitset>
#include <map>

using std::vector;
using std::set;
using std::pair;
using std::bitset;
using std::map;
using std::max;
using std::cin;
using std::cout;

const int maxN = 15000007;
bitset<maxN> primes;
int spf[maxN];

void sieve() {
  primes.set();
  primes[0] = primes[1] = 0;
  for (int i = 2; i < maxN; i++)
    spf[i] = i;
  for (int i = 4; i < maxN; i += 2) {
    if (i != 2)
      primes[i] = 0;
    spf[i] = 2;
  }
  for (int i = 3; i < maxN; i++) {
    if (primes[i]) {
      for (int j = i * i; j < maxN; j += i) {
        primes[j] = 0;
        spf[j] = i;
      }
    }
  }
}

void factorize(const vector<int>& v, map<int, int>& countOfFactors) {
  for (int eleInArray : v) {
    set<int> primeFactors;
    int n = eleInArray;
    while (n != 1) {
      primeFactors.insert(spf[n]);
      n /= spf[n];
    }
    for (int i : primeFactors)
      countOfFactors[i]++;
  }
}

void solve() {
  sieve();
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  vector<int> v(n);
  int gcdIs = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> v[i];
    gcdIs = std::__gcd(gcdIs, v[i]);
  }
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    v[i] /= gcdIs;
  }
  map<int, int> countOfFactors;
  factorize(v, countOfFactors);
  int keep = 0;
  for (auto i : countOfFactors) {
    keep = max(keep, i.second);
  }
  keep ? (cout << n - keep) : (cout << "-1");
}

int main() {
  std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  solve();
  return 0;
}
```

In this optimized code, the unnecessary macros have been removed, redundant functions have been removed, and explicit `using` statements have been used instead of a blanket `using namespace std;`. The vector `v` is now passed to the `factorize` function by reference to avoid unnecessary copying. Additionally, the `unordered_map<int, int>` has been replaced with `map<int, int>`, and the `std::__gcd` function has been used instead of the custom `gcd` function. These changes aim to improve code readability and performance by reducing memory usage and unnecessary function calls.
