The given code appears to be a program that calculates the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from an array in order to make all the remaining elements coprime (i.e., their greatest common divisor is 1).

Upon analyzing the code, the following potential optimizations can be identified:

1. The `sieve` function is used to populate the `lpf` (lowest prime factor) array. Instead of using this function, which has a time complexity of O(N log log N), we can directly calculate the lowest prime factors of numbers on the fly while iterating through the array elements. This can reduce the overall time complexity.

2. The `cont` array is used to keep count of the frequency of each prime factor. However, the size of this array is unnecessarily large (N) and can be reduced to a smaller size. Since the maximum value of `arr[i]` is not known in advance, we can dynamically allocate memory for the `cont` array based on the maximum value found in the input array.

3. The `__gcd` function from the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header is used to calculate the greatest common divisor of the array elements. Instead of relying on this function, we can implement our own gcd function to avoid the overhead of including unnecessary headers.

4. The `maxi` variable is used to keep track of the maximum frequency of prime factors. However, the initial value of `maxi` is 0, which means that the condition `if (maxi == 0)` will always be true. We can initialize `maxi` to a negative value to handle the case when all elements in the array are coprime.

Based on these observations, the following optimization strategy can be formulated:

1. Replace the `sieve` function with a more efficient approach to calculate the lowest prime factors on the fly while iterating through the array elements.

2. Dynamically allocate memory for the `cont` array based on the maximum value found in the input array.

3. Implement a custom gcd function to avoid the overhead of including unnecessary headers.

4. Initialize `maxi` to a negative value to handle the case when all elements in the array are coprime.

Now, let's go through each optimization step in detail and update the code accordingly.
