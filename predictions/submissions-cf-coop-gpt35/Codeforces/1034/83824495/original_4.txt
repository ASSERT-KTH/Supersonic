The provided code calculates the maximum number of elements in an array that can be divided by a common factor greater than 1. It uses a sieve to find the least prime factor for each number and then counts the frequency of each factor in the array. Finally, it outputs the difference between the total number of elements and the maximum frequency.

To optimize this code, we can focus on the following areas:

1. Unnecessary memory usage: The code uses an array `lpf` of size `N` to store the least prime factor for each number. However, we only need to store the least prime factor for numbers up to `n`, where `n` is the maximum element in the array `arr`. Therefore, we can reduce the size of the `lpf` array to `n+1`.

2. Redundant computations: The code calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all elements in the array `arr` using the `__gcd` function. However, we can optimize this by calculating the GCD using a more efficient algorithm such as Euclid's algorithm.

3. Inefficient loop: The loop that calculates the frequency of each factor in the array can be optimized. Instead of iterating over all numbers from 2 to `N`, we can iterate over the unique factors in the array `arr` and count their frequencies directly.

4. Compiler optimization: We can use compiler optimizations and pragma directives to hint the compiler to optimize certain parts of the code.

Now let's go through each optimization step in detail:

1. Unnecessary memory usage:
   - Replace the line `#define N 17000005` with `const int N = 2000000` to reduce the size of the `lpf` array.
   - Replace the line `int lpf[N]` with `int lpf[n+1]` to reduce the size of the `lpf` array based on the maximum element in `arr`.

2. Redundant computations:
   - Replace the line `mcd = __gcd(mcd, arr[i])` with `mcd = gcd(mcd, arr[i])` to use the more efficient GCD algorithm.
   - Add the following function definition above the `main` function to implement Euclid's algorithm for GCD calculation:
     ```
     int gcd(int a, int b) {
       while (b != 0) {
         int temp = b;
         b = a % b;
         a = temp;
       }
       return a;
     }
     ```

3. Inefficient loop:
   - Remove the `sieve` function as it is not needed for this optimization task.
   - Remove the line `int cont[N]` as it will be replaced with a more efficient data structure.
   - Replace the loop that calculates the frequency of each factor with the following optimized code:
     ```
     unordered_map<int, int> cont;
     for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
       int num = arr[i];
       while (num > 1) {
         int f = lpf[num];
         cont[f]++;
         while (num % f == 0)
           num /= f;
       }
     }
     ```

4. Compiler optimization:
   - Add the following pragma directive at the beginning of the code to enable compiler optimization: `#pragma GCC optimize("O3")`.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>
using namespace std;

int gcd(int a, int b) {
  while (b != 0) {
    int temp = b;
    b = a % b;
    a = temp;
  }
  return a;
}

int main() {
  #pragma GCC optimize("O3")

  int n;
  cin >> n;

  int arr[n];
  int mcd = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> arr[i];
    mcd = gcd(mcd, arr[i]);
  }

  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    arr[i] /= mcd;

  int maxi = 0;
  unordered_map<int, int> cont;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    int num = arr[i];
    while (num > 1) {
      int f = lpf[num];
      cont[f]++;
      while (num % f == 0)
        num /= f;
    }
  }
  for (const auto& pair : cont)
    maxi = max(maxi, pair.second);

  if (maxi == 0)
    cout << -1 << '\n';
  else
    cout << n - maxi << '\n';

  return 0;
}
```

Note: The `unordered_map` is used to store the frequency of each factor, allowing for efficient lookup and insertion. This will improve the performance compared to using a fixed-size array `cont`. However, it may slightly increase the memory usage due to the overhead of the hash table. Overall, this trade-off is acceptable considering the potential performance gain.
