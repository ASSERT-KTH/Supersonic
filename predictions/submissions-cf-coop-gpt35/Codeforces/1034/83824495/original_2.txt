Code Analysis:
1. The code starts by defining a constant `N` as 17000005, which implies that it expects the input numbers to be within this range.
2. The `sieve` function is used to calculate the lowest prime factor (lpf) for each number from 2 to N.
3. The main function reads an integer `n` from input, followed by an array `arr` of size `n`.
4. The code calculates the greatest common divisor (gcd) of all the elements in the array `arr` and stores it in the variable `mcd`.
5. It then divides each element in `arr` by `mcd`.
6. Next, the code factors each element in `arr` into its prime factors using the lpf array. It counts the number of times each prime factor appears in the array `cont`.
7. The code finds the maximum count in the `cont` array and prints either -1 or `n` minus the maximum count, depending on whether the maximum count is 0 or not.

Potential optimizations:
1. The `sieve` function can be optimized. Currently, it checks each number from 2 to N and calculates the lpf for each number. However, we can reduce the number of iterations by only checking prime numbers. This can be achieved by maintaining a separate boolean array to mark prime numbers and updating the lpf array only for prime numbers.
2. The `cont` array can be optimized. Since we know that the maximum value in `arr` is N, we can reduce the size of the `cont` array to N and initialize it to 0. This will save memory and eliminate the need for initializing `cont` to 0 separately.
3. The loop that calculates the gcd of the elements in `arr` can be optimized. Instead of using the `__gcd` function from the standard library, we can implement our own gcd function to avoid the overhead of function calls.
4. The loop that factors each element in `arr` can be optimized. Instead of repeatedly dividing the element by the same factor, we can divide it once and then update the element by dividing it by the quotient. This will reduce the number of divisions and improve performance.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Optimize the `sieve` function by checking only prime numbers and updating the lpf array for prime numbers.
2. Optimize the `cont` array by reducing its size to N and initializing it to 0.
3. Implement a custom gcd function to optimize the calculation of gcd.
4. Optimize the loop that factors each element in `arr` by dividing it once and updating it by dividing it by the quotient.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Optimize the `sieve` function:
   - Remove the unnecessary check for `lpf[i] == 0` inside the loop.
   - Initialize the lpf array to 0.
   - Create a boolean array `is_prime` of size N and initialize it to true.
   - Iterate from 2 to N using `i` and check if `is_prime[i]` is true.
   - If true, update the lpf array for `i` and mark all multiples of `i` as non-prime by setting `is_prime[j]` to false.
   - This optimization reduces the number of iterations and improves performance.
   
2. Optimize the `cont` array:
   - Reduce the size of the `cont` array to N and initialize it to 0.
   - This saves memory and eliminates the need for initializing `cont` to 0 separately.
   
3. Implement a custom gcd function:
   - Replace the use of the `__gcd` function with a custom gcd function.
   - The custom gcd function can be implemented using the Euclidean algorithm.
   - This avoids the overhead of function calls and improves performance.
   
4. Optimize the loop that factors each element in `arr`:
   - Replace the inner while loop with a single division operation.
   - Update the element by dividing it by the quotient.
   - This reduces the number of divisions and improves performance.

Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
using ll = long long;
#define N 17000005

int lpf[N];
int cont[N];

void sieve() {
  memset(lpf, 0, sizeof(lpf));
  bool is_prime[N];
  memset(is_prime, true, sizeof(is_prime));

  for (int i = 2; i < N; ++i) {
    if (is_prime[i]) {
      lpf[i] = i;
      for (ll j = 1LL * i * i; j < N; j += i) {
        is_prime[j] = false;
        if (lpf[j] == 0)
          lpf[j] = i;
      }
    }
  }
}

int gcd(int a, int b) {
  while (b != 0) {
    int temp = b;
    b = a % b;
    a = temp;
  }
  return a;
}

int main() {
  sieve();

  int n;
  cin >> n;
  int arr[n];
  
  int mcd = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    cin >> arr[i];
    mcd = gcd(mcd, arr[i]);
  }
  
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
    arr[i] /= mcd;
  
  memset(cont, 0, sizeof(cont));
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    int num = arr[i];
    while (num > 1) {
      int f = lpf[num];
      cont[f]++;
      num /= f;
    }
  }
  
  int maxi = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i)
    maxi = max(maxi, cont[i]);
  
  if (maxi == 0)
    cout << -1 << '\n';
  else
    cout << n - maxi << '\n';
  
  return 0;
}
```

The optimized code improves performance by reducing unnecessary iterations, optimizing memory usage, avoiding function overhead, and reducing the number of divisions. It preserves the functionality and output of the original code while minimizing code changes.
