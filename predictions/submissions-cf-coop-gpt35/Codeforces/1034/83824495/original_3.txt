The given code calculates the maximum number of elements that can be removed from an array such that the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the remaining elements is equal to 1. The code uses a sieve algorithm to calculate the smallest prime factor (lpf) for each number up to N. Then, it counts the occurrences of each prime factor in the array elements and finds the maximum count. Finally, it subtracts the maximum count from the total number of elements to get the desired result.

To optimize this code, we can focus on the following areas:

1. Use a more efficient data structure for storing prime factors and their counts.
2. Avoid unnecessary computations, such as recalculating the GCD for each element.
3. Optimize loops to minimize redundant calculations.
4. Use compiler optimizations or pragma directives to hint the compiler for better performance.

Let's proceed with the step-by-step explanation of each optimization:

1. Efficient Data Structure:

   The current code uses a simple array `cont` to store prime factors and their counts. However, this approach is not memory-efficient since it requires an array of size N. We can use a `std::unordered_map` to store prime factors as keys and their counts as values. This data structure provides constant time complexity for insertion and retrieval operations.

   ```cpp
   unordered_map<int, int> cont;
   ```

2. Avoid Recalculating GCD:

   The code currently calculates the GCD of all elements in the array using the `__gcd` function. However, we can optimize this by calculating the GCD only once before the loop, as the GCD will remain the same for all elements after dividing each element by the GCD.

   ```cpp
   int mcd = arr[0];
   for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
     mcd = __gcd(mcd, arr[i]);
   }
   ```

3. Optimize Loops:

   a. In the first loop, the sieve algorithm is used to calculate the smallest prime factors for each number up to N. However, the current code starts the loop from 2 and goes up to N, which is inefficient. We can optimize this by starting the loop from 2 and incrementing by the smallest prime factor of the current number, which is already calculated using the sieve algorithm.

   ```cpp
   for (int i = 2; i < N; i++) {
     if (lpf[i] == 0) {
       lpf[i] = i;
       for (ll j = 1LL * i * i; j < N; j += i) {
         if (lpf[j] == 0)
           lpf[j] = i;
       }
     }
     i += lpf[i] - 1;
   }
   ```

   b. In the last loop, the code finds the maximum count from the `cont` array. However, we can optimize this by iterating over the elements in the `cont` map and keeping track of the maximum count directly.

   ```cpp
   int maxi = 0;
   for (const auto& entry : cont) {
     maxi = max(maxi, entry.second);
   }
   ```

4. Compiler Optimizations:

   We can use compiler optimizations or pragma directives to hint the compiler for better performance. For example, we can use the `-O2` optimization level during compilation to enable optimizations like loop unrolling, function inlining, and constant propagation.

   ```cpp
   // Add this line at the beginning of the code
   #pragma GCC optimize("O2")
   ```

Now, let's combine all the optimizations and present the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
using ll = long long;
#define N 17000005

#pragma GCC optimize("O2")

unordered_map<int, int> cont;
int lpf[N];

void sieve() {
  for (int i = 2; i < N; i++) {
    if (lpf[i] == 0) {
      lpf[i] = i;
      for (ll j = 1LL * i * i; j < N; j += i) {
        if (lpf[j] == 0)
          lpf[j] = i;
      }
      i += lpf[i] - 1;
    }
  }
}

int main() {
  sieve();

  int n;
  cin >> n;

  int arr[n];
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> arr[i];
  }

  int mcd = arr[0];
  for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
    mcd = __gcd(mcd, arr[i]);
  }

  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    arr[i] /= mcd;
    while (arr[i] > 1) {
      int f = lpf[arr[i]];
      cont[f]++;
      while (arr[i] % f == 0)
        arr[i] /= f;
    }
  }

  int maxi = 0;
  for (const auto& entry : cont) {
    maxi = max(maxi, entry.second);
  }

  if (maxi == 0)
    cout << -1 << '\n';
  else
    cout << n - maxi << '\n';

  return 0;
}
```

Note: The optimized code assumes that the input values will not exceed the range of `int` data type. If the input values can be larger, you may need to adjust the data types accordingly.
