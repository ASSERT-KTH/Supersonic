The given code appears to be a solution to a problem involving sorting and processing a set of tuples. However, there are several areas where the code can be optimized for performance and memory usage. 

1. Unnecessary Includes: The code includes the entire `bits/stdc++.h` header, which includes a large number of standard library headers. This can lead to increased compile time and unnecessary memory usage. It is recommended to include only the necessary headers.

2. Excessive Use of Macros: The code uses a large number of macros, such as `fastio`, `endl`, and `watch`. While macros can be useful for shortening code, excessive use can make the code difficult to read and debug. It is recommended to remove unnecessary macros and replace them with regular function calls.

3. Redundant Data Structures: The code uses a `multiset` to store a set of tuples, which can be inefficient for this problem. Since the tuples are sorted based on the first element, a `multiset` is not necessary. Instead, a `vector` of tuples can be used, and the `sort` function can be applied to sort the vector.

4. Unnecessary Tuple Access: The code repeatedly accesses individual elements of the tuples using the `T` macro. This can be inefficient, especially within inner loops. It is recommended to use structured bindings (C++17) or `std::get` instead of the `T` macro for tuple access.

5. Suboptimal Loop Structure: The code uses a combination of range-based for loops and manual indexing loops. This can lead to unnecessary overhead and potential bugs. It is recommended to use consistent loop structures, such as regular for loops, throughout the code.

6. Inefficient Output: The code uses a separate loop to output the result array. This can be optimized by using `std::copy` or `std::ostream_iterator` to directly output the result array.

Based on these observations, the following optimization strategy can be proposed:

1. Remove unnecessary includes and macros.
2. Replace the `multiset` with a `vector` to store the tuples.
3. Sort the vector of tuples using the `sort` function.
4. Replace the `T` macro with structured bindings or `std::get`.
5. Modify the loop structure to use regular for loops.
6. Optimize the output of the result array.
