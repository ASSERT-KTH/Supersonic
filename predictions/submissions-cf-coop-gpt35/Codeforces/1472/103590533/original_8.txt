The given code is a C++ program that solves a specific problem. However, the code includes several unnecessary and inefficient parts that can be optimized for better performance. Let's analyze the code and propose optimization strategies for each section.

**1. Code Analysis:**

- The code includes many unnecessary header file inclusions. We only need the `iostream` and `vector` headers for this specific program. We can remove the unnecessary `bits/stdc++.h` inclusion.

- The code uses several macros to define common operations, such as `endl` for a new line, `ll` for long long, and `v(type)` for a vector of type. While these macros can make the code more concise, they can also lead to potential performance issues. We should consider replacing these macros with explicit code to improve performance.

- The code uses a `multiset` to store a tuple of three elements. However, using a `multiset` is not necessary in this case, and it can lead to unnecessary memory usage and slower performance. We can replace it with a `vector` of tuples, sorted manually if required.

- The code uses the `auto` keyword extensively, which can make the code less readable and harder to optimize. We should consider using explicit type declarations to improve readability and allow for better optimizations.

**2. Optimization Strategy:**

Based on the code analysis, we can propose the following optimization strategies:

- Remove unnecessary header file inclusions and use explicit header files only.

- Replace macros with explicit code to improve performance.

- Replace the `multiset` with a `vector` of tuples, sorted manually if required.

- Use explicit type declarations instead of the `auto` keyword for better readability and optimization opportunities.

**3. Step-by-Step Explanation:**

Let's go through each optimization step in detail:

1. Remove unnecessary header file inclusions and use explicit header files only:

   - Remove the line `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` as it includes unnecessary header files.

   - Replace it with explicit header file inclusions:
   
     ```cpp
     #include <iostream>
     #include <vector>
     ```

2. Replace macros with explicit code to improve performance:

   - Remove the macro definitions `endl`, `ll`, `v(type)`, etc. and replace them with their explicit code counterparts.

   - For example, replace `endl` with `"\n"`, `ll` with `long long`, `v(type)` with `std::vector<type>`, etc.

3. Replace the `multiset` with a `vector` of tuples, sorted manually if required:

   - Replace the line `ms(tll) a;` with `std::vector<tll> a;`.

   - Replace `a.insert(MT(max(x, y), min(x, y), i));` with `a.push_back(std::make_tuple(max(x, y), min(x, y), i));`.

   - If sorting is required, add `std::sort(a.begin(), a.end());` after the loop that populates the `a` vector.

4. Use explicit type declarations instead of the `auto` keyword for better readability and optimization opportunities:

   - Replace `auto prev = (*a.begin());` with `tll prev = a[0];`.

   - Replace `auto best = prev;` with `tll best = prev;`.

   - Replace `for (const auto &person : a)` with `for (const tll &person : a)`.

   - Replace `int h, w, i; tie(h, w, i) = person;` with `ll h, w, i; std::tie(h, w, i) = person;`.

5. Clean up unnecessary code:

   - Remove the `fileio()` function as it is not used in the `solve()` function.

**4. Optimized Code Block:**

Here's the optimized version of the code after applying the optimization strategies:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <tuple>

#define endl "\n"

typedef long long ll;
typedef std::pair<ll, ll> pll;
typedef std::vector<int> vi;
typedef std::vector<pll> vpll;
typedef std::vector<ll> vll;
typedef std::vector<vll> vv;
typedef std::vector<std::tuple<ll, ll, ll>> vtll;

void solve() {
  int t, n, x, y;
  std::cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    std::cin >> n;
    vtll a;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      std::cin >> x >> y;
      a.push_back(std::make_tuple(std::max(x, y), std::min(x, y), i));
    }
    std::sort(a.begin(), a.end());

    tll prev = a[0];
    tll best = prev;
    vll res(n);
    for (const tll &person : a) {
      ll h, w, i;
      std::tie(h, w, i) = person;
      if (std::get<0>(prev) == h) {
        if (std::get<1>(best) < w && std::get<0>(best) < h)
          res[i] = std::get<2>(best) + 1;
        else {
          res[i] = -1;
        }
      } else {
        if (std::get<1>(best) > std::get<1>(prev))
          best = prev;
        if (std::get<1>(best) < w && std::get<0>(best) < h)
          res[i] = std::get<2>(best) + 1;
        else
          res[i] = -1;
        prev = person;
      }
    }

    for (const auto &p : res)
      std::cout << p << " ";
    std::cout << endl;
  }
}

int main() {
  solve();
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized code preserves the functionality and output of the original code while improving performance and reducing memory usage.
