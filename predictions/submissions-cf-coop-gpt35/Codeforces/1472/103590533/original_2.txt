The given code appears to solve a problem that involves sorting and processing a collection of tuples. However, there are several areas where the code can be optimized for performance and memory usage.

1. Unnecessary Includes: The code includes the entire `<bits/stdc++.h>` header, which is a non-standard header and can slow down compilation time. It is better to include only the necessary standard headers that are actually used in the code.

2. Excessive Use of Macros: The code extensively uses macros for defining common operations and data structures. While macros can improve code readability, they can also introduce unnecessary overhead and lead to larger code size. It is better to replace some of the macros with inline functions or templates, which can be better optimized by the compiler.

3. Redundant Data Structures: The code uses a `multiset` to store a collection of tuples. However, a `multiset` is not necessary for this problem, as the tuples do not need to be sorted or have duplicate values. Using a `vector` instead of a `multiset` can reduce memory usage and improve performance.

4. Unnecessary Sorting: The code sorts the `multiset` of tuples unnecessarily. Since the tuples are already inserted in the required order, there is no need to sort them again. This sorting operation can be removed to improve performance.

5. Unnecessary Tuple Assignments: The code assigns the values of the tuple elements to separate variables (`h`, `w`, `i`) in each iteration of the loop. This can be avoided by directly accessing the tuple elements using `get<>` function, which can eliminate unnecessary assignments and improve performance.

6. Unnecessary Copying of Tuples: The code creates copies of the tuples when comparing them or assigning them to other variables. This unnecessary copying can be avoided by using references to the tuples, which can improve performance and reduce memory usage.

7. Unnecessary Output Formatting: The code prints the output values one by one with a space delimiter. Instead, it is more efficient to store the output values in a `vector` and print them using the `printall` function. This eliminates the need for multiple output statements and improves performance.

8. Unnecessary File I/O: The code includes a `fileio` function that redirects input and output to files. However, this function is not used in the code, so it can be removed to simplify the code.

Based on these observations, the following optimization strategy can be formulated:

1. Replace the unnecessary `<bits/stdc++.h>` header with the necessary standard headers.
2. Replace some of the macros with inline functions or templates.
3. Replace the `multiset` with a `vector`.
4. Remove the unnecessary sorting operation.
5. Access tuple elements directly using `get<>` function.
6. Use references to tuples instead of creating copies.
7. Store output values in a `vector` and print them using the `printall` function.
8. Remove the unused `fileio` function.

Now, let's implement these optimizations step by step in the code.
