The given code appears to be a solution to a programming problem. It reads input, performs some calculations, and outputs the result. However, there are several areas in which the code can be optimized for efficiency:

1. Unnecessary Includes: The `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` directive includes the entire C++ standard library, which is unnecessary and can slow down the compilation process. It is better to include only the necessary headers.

2. Excessive Use of Templates: The code uses many template aliases, such as `v(type)` and `s(type)`, to define container types. While this allows for code flexibility, it can lead to increased memory usage and slower compilation times. It would be more efficient to use specific container types directly.

3. Redundant Output Stream Flushing: The `endl` manipulator is used frequently to insert a newline character and flush the output stream. However, flushing the output stream after every line can be inefficient. It is better to use the newline character `'\n'` instead.

4. Inefficient Sorting: The `sortall(a)` macro is defined but not used in the code. If sorting is required, it should be done explicitly using the `sort` function.

5. Unnecessary Tuple Construction: The `tie` function is used to unpack the elements of a tuple into separate variables. However, these variables are immediately used to access the tuple elements. It would be more efficient to access the tuple elements directly.

6. Inefficient Container Usage: The code uses a `multiset` to store tuples. However, a `multiset` is not required since the code does not rely on the sorted order or allow duplicate elements. Using a `vector` instead of a `multiset` would improve performance.

7. Unoptimized Loop: The loop that iterates over the elements of the `a` container can be optimized by eliminating unnecessary comparisons and assignments.

Based on these observations, the following optimization steps can be taken:

1. Remove unnecessary includes and define specific container types.
2. Replace `endl` with `'\n'` for newline characters.
3. Remove the `sortall(a)` macro.
4. Replace `tie` function usage with direct tuple element access.
5. Replace `multiset` with `vector` for storing tuples.
6. Optimize the loop by eliminating unnecessary comparisons and assignments.
