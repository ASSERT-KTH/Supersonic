Upon analyzing the provided code, the following potential optimizations and improvements can be made:

1. Removing unnecessary header files: The code includes the `bits/stdc++.h` header file, which is not recommended as it includes all the standard C++ library headers. It is better to include only the necessary headers to reduce compilation time and improve code readability.

2. Avoiding the use of macros: The code extensively uses macros for defining constants, loops, and other operations. While macros can provide convenience, they can also lead to code readability issues and potential bugs. It is recommended to replace macros with proper function or variable definitions.

3. Avoiding unnecessary data structures: The code uses multiple data structures like vectors, sets, and maps. Some of these data structures may not be necessary and can be replaced with simpler alternatives, reducing memory usage and improving performance.

4. Simplifying loop logic: The code uses nested while loops to iterate over the input array. This can be simplified by using a single loop and updating the index accordingly.

5. Optimizing arithmetic operations: The code includes multiple arithmetic operations like exponentiation and modulo calculations. These operations can be optimized using more efficient algorithms or by utilizing compiler optimizations.

6. Minimizing function calls: The code includes multiple function calls, some of which can be avoided by simplifying the logic or combining operations.

Based on these observations, the following optimization strategy can be formulated:

1. Replace the `bits/stdc++.h` header file with the necessary standard library headers.

2. Remove unnecessary macros and replace them with proper function or variable definitions.

3. Replace the usage of `vector`, `set`, and `map` with simpler alternatives where possible.

4. Simplify the loop logic to iterate over the input array.

5. Optimize the arithmetic operations, such as exponentiation and modulo calculations.

6. Minimize unnecessary function calls.

Let's now proceed with the step-by-step explanation and implementation of these optimizations in the code.
