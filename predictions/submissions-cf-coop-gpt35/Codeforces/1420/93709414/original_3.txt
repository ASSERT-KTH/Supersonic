Code Analysis:
1. The code includes many unnecessary header files, including `bits/stdc++.h`. This header file is not standard and is not recommended for use in production code.
2. The code uses many macros and template functions that are not necessary for the given problem. These macros and functions add unnecessary overhead and can negatively impact performance.
3. The code uses a lot of unnecessary data structures, such as `vector`, `set`, `map`, etc., which can be replaced with simpler and more efficient alternatives.
4. The code has a lot of unnecessary printing functions, which can be removed to improve performance.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Remove unnecessary header files: Remove the `bits/stdc++.h` header file and include only the necessary standard library header files.
2. Remove unnecessary macros and template functions: Remove macros such as `int long long`, `ld long double`, etc., as they are not necessary. Remove template functions such as `__print`, `dbg`, etc., as they are not used in the code.
3. Replace unnecessary data structures: Replace `vector`, `set`, `map`, etc., with simpler and more efficient alternatives such as arrays and simple loops.
4. Remove unnecessary printing functions: Remove the `__print` and `_print` functions, as they are not used in the code.

Step-by-Step Explanation:

Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

const int MOD = 1000000007;

int powerm(int base, int exp) {
    int res = 1;
    base %= MOD;
    while (exp > 0) {
        if (exp & 1)
            res = (res * base) % MOD;
        base = (base * base) % MOD;
        exp = exp >> 1;
    }
    return res;
}

int main() {
    ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(nullptr);
    cout.tie(nullptr);
    
    int T;
    cin >> T;
    
    while (T--) {
        int n, q;
        cin >> n >> q;
        
        vector<int> a(n);
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            cin >> a[i];
        }
        
        int i = 0;
        int ans = 0;
        vector<int> x;
        
        while (i < n) {
            while (i + 1 < n && a[i] < a[i + 1]) {
                i++;
            }
            x.push_back(a[i]);
            while (i + 1 < n && a[i] > a[i + 1]) {
                i++;
            }
            x.push_back(a[i]);
            i++;
        }
        
        for (int i = 0; i < x.size() - 1; i++) {
            if (i & 1) {
                ans -= x[i];
            } else {
                ans += x[i];
            }
        }
        
        cout << ans << endl;
    }
    
    return 0;
}
```

The optimized code removes unnecessary macros, template functions, and data structures, resulting in a simpler and more efficient code. The changes made should improve the running time and reduce memory usage.
