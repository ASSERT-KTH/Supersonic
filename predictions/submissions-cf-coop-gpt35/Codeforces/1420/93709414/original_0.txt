Before diving into the optimization strategy, let's first analyze the given code and identify any potential performance bottlenecks or areas for improvement.

1. The code includes a large number of unnecessary preprocessor definitions and macros, which can make the code difficult to read and understand. These macros should be removed or replaced with explicit code.

2. The code imports the entire `<bits/stdc++.h>` library, which can significantly increase the compilation time and memory usage. It is recommended to include only the necessary standard libraries.

3. The code uses unnecessary functions for printing debug statements (`__print`, `_print`, `__print`, `dbg`). These functions can be removed to improve performance.

4. The code includes unnecessary math functions (`powerm`, `power`, `powerNeg`, `modinv`) that are not used in the current implementation. These functions should be removed.

5. The code uses a vector (`x`) to store the elements of the array `a`. This additional vector increases memory usage and can be avoided.

6. The code uses a nested loop to iterate through the array `a` and calculate the final sum. This can be optimized by using a single loop and updating the sum directly.

Now that we have identified the potential areas for optimization, let's formulate an optimization strategy.
