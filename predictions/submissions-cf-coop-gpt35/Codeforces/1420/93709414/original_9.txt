The given code contains a lot of unnecessary macros and includes that are not used in the program. These can be removed to improve the code readability and reduce the compilation time.

Here is the optimization strategy for the given code:

1. Remove unnecessary macros: The code contains many macros that are not used. Removing these macros will improve code readability and reduce the compilation time.

2. Remove unnecessary includes: The code includes the `bits/stdc++.h` header file, which includes all the standard library headers. This is not recommended as it can increase the compilation time. We should include only the necessary headers.

3. Remove unused functions: The code contains several functions that are not used in the program. These functions can be safely removed to reduce the code size and improve readability.

4. Use more efficient data structures: The code uses `vector` for storing the input array and `map` for storing the answer. However, using a `deque` instead of a `vector` can improve the performance of the program. Additionally, we can use a simple integer variable instead of a `map` to store the answer.

5. Remove unnecessary computations: The code contains some unnecessary computations. For example, the `power` and `powerNeg` functions are not used in the program and can be removed. 

6. Remove unnecessary variables: The code declares several variables that are not used. These variables can be safely removed to reduce memory usage.

7. Optimize loops: The code contains a while loop that can be optimized. Instead of using a while loop, we can use a for loop to iterate over the array.

8. Add compiler optimizations: We can use compiler optimizations to improve the performance of the code. For example, we can use the `-O3` flag to enable aggressive optimization by the compiler.

Now, I will provide the optimized code with the changes mentioned above.
