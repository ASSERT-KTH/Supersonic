Code Analysis:

1. The code includes many unnecessary headers, such as `<bits/stdc++.h>`, which includes all standard library headers. It is better to include only the necessary headers to reduce unnecessary code bloat.

2. The code uses macros for loop iteration, such as `FOR` and `REP`, which can be replaced with standard C++ loop constructs (`for` loop) for better readability.

3. The code includes many unnecessary utility functions and overloaded operators, such as `chmin`, `chmax`, `IN`, `ceil`, `make_v`, `fill_v`, and overloaded stream operators. These functions and operators are not used in the code and can be removed.

4. The code uses a recursive divide-and-conquer algorithm (`divide_and_conquer` function) to solve a specific problem. This algorithm can be optimized to reduce memory usage and improve running time.

5. The `cf190div1E` and `cf438F` namespaces are not used in the code and can be removed.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Remove unnecessary headers: Remove the unnecessary headers like `<bits/stdc++.h>` and `<iostream>`. Only include the necessary headers like `<iostream>` and `<vector>`.

2. Replace macros with loop constructs: Replace the macros `FOR` and `REP` with standard C++ loop constructs (`for` loop) for better readability.

3. Remove unnecessary utility functions and overloaded operators: Remove the unnecessary utility functions and overloaded operators, such as `chmin`, `chmax`, `IN`, `ceil`, `make_v`, `fill_v`, and overloaded stream operators.

4. Optimize the divide-and-conquer algorithm: The `divide_and_conquer` function can be optimized by:
   - Avoiding unnecessary memory allocation: Instead of creating a 2D vector `dp` of size `h x w`, use a 1D vector of size `w` and update its values in-place.
   - Avoiding unnecessary function calls: Instead of using a recursive function `dfs`, use a nested loop to calculate the values of `dp`.
   - Using loop unrolling: Unroll the inner loop of the nested loop to process multiple elements in parallel and reduce loop overhead.

Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. Remove unnecessary headers: Remove the unnecessary headers like `<bits/stdc++.h>` and `<iostream>`. Only include the necessary headers like `<iostream>` and `<vector>`.

2. Replace macros with loop constructs: Replace the macros `FOR` and `REP` with standard C++ loop constructs (`for` loop) for better readability.

3. Remove unnecessary utility functions and overloaded operators: Remove the unnecessary utility functions and overloaded operators, such as `chmin`, `chmax`, `IN`, `ceil`, `make_v`, `fill_v`, and overloaded stream operators.

4. Optimize the divide-and-conquer algorithm:
   - Instead of creating a 2D vector `dp` of size `h x w`, use a 1D vector of size `w` and update its values in-place.
   - Replace the recursive function `dfs` with a nested loop to calculate the values of `dp`.
   - Unroll the inner loop of the nested loop to process multiple elements in parallel and reduce loop overhead.

The optimized code focuses on reducing unnecessary code, improving readability, and optimizing the divide-and-conquer algorithm. The changes made preserve the functionality and output of the original code while improving its efficiency.
