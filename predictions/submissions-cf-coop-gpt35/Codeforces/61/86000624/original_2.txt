The provided code calculates the diameter of a tree. It takes an input value `n` representing the number of nodes in the tree, followed by `n-1` lines of input where each line contains three integers `x`, `y`, and `w`. These integers represent an edge between nodes `x` and `y`, with weight `w`. The code then calculates the diameter of the tree using a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm.

Upon analyzing the code, I have identified the following potential optimizations:

1. Unnecessary use of `std::pair`: The code uses `std::pair` to represent edges of the tree, where the first element is the node and the second element is the weight. However, this introduces unnecessary overhead and can be simplified.

2. Inefficient memory allocation: The code uses a `std::vector` of `std::pair` to represent the adjacency list of the tree. However, this approach can be memory-intensive, especially when dealing with large trees. A more memory-efficient data structure can be used.

3. Redundant calculation of `2 * sum`: The code calculates `2 * sum` to avoid double-counting the weights of the edges. However, this can be simplified by directly subtracting `big` from `sum`.

4. Inefficient loop for BFS: The code uses a `std::queue` to perform the BFS. However, it uses an additional array `seen` to keep track of visited nodes. This introduces unnecessary memory overhead. Additionally, the code doesn't take advantage of the fact that the tree is connected, which can be leveraged to optimize the BFS algorithm.

Based on these observations, here is the step-by-step optimization plan:

1. Replace `std::pair` with a custom struct: Replace the usage of `std::pair` with a custom struct to represent edges. This will simplify the code and improve readability.

2. Replace `std::vector` with a more memory-efficient data structure: Replace the use of `std::vector` to represent the adjacency list with a more memory-efficient data structure, such as an array of linked lists.

3. Simplify calculation of `2 * sum`: Instead of calculating `2 * sum` and then subtracting `big`, directly subtract `big` from `sum` to obtain the final result.

4. Optimize BFS algorithm: Take advantage of the connected nature of the tree to optimize the BFS algorithm. Avoid using an additional array to keep track of visited nodes.

Now, let's proceed with the optimized code:
