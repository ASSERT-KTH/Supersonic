Upon analyzing the given code, the following potential areas for optimization can be identified:

1. Memory Usage: The code uses a map to store the frequencies of remainders. However, using a map introduces additional memory overhead. Since the remainders are non-negative integers, a simple array can be used instead to store the frequencies, resulting in reduced memory usage.

2. Loop Optimization: The inner loop, which iterates over the map, can be optimized. Currently, it uses range-based for loop and accesses the map by reference. Instead, we can use a regular for loop to iterate over the map using iterators, which may result in better performance.

3. Unnecessary Map Operations: The map operations `x[best_w]--`, `x.erase(best_w)`, and `x[remain]++` can be replaced with direct array operations, as we will be using an array to store the frequencies.

4. Input/Output: The code uses `scanf` and `printf` for input and output operations, respectively. These functions are known to be slower compared to their counterparts in the C++ standard library, such as `cin` and `cout`. Therefore, using `cin` and `cout` instead of `scanf` and `printf` may provide a performance improvement.

Based on these observations, the following optimization steps can be taken:

1. Replace the `map<int, int> x` declaration with an array `int freq[200001]`.
2. Modify the inner loop to use iterators for iterating over the map.
3. Replace the map operations with array operations.
4. Replace `scanf` and `printf` with `cin` and `cout`, respectively.

The optimized code is as follows:
