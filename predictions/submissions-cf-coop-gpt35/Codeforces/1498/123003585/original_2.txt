The given code appears to be a solution to a problem that involves finding the maximum number of items that can be selected from a set, given a weight constraint. However, the code can be optimized in several ways to improve its performance and memory usage.

1. Avoid using `using namespace std;`: This line imports all the names from the `std` namespace into the global namespace, which can lead to naming conflicts and make the code harder to read. It is better to explicitly specify the namespace for each name used from the `std` namespace.

2. Replace `scanf` with `cin` and `printf` with `cout`: The `scanf` and `printf` functions are slower than the corresponding `cin` and `cout` stream operations. Using stream operations can improve the I/O performance of the program.

3. Use `vector` instead of C-style arrays: Instead of using a C-style array `int a[n]`, use a `vector<int>` for better memory management and safety. Vectors provide dynamic memory allocation and automatic memory deallocation, along with several useful member functions.

4. Sort the vector in descending order: Currently, the vector `a` is sorted in descending order using the `sort` function. However, this can be optimized by using a partial sort algorithm (`partial_sort`) that only sorts the first `W` elements of the vector. Since only the top `W` elements are needed, this can potentially improve the performance.

5. Use a `vector` instead of a `map`: The map `x` is used to keep track of the remaining weight possibilities. However, using a `map` incurs additional memory and overhead due to the internal tree structure. Instead, use a `vector<int>` to store the remaining weights. The index of the vector will represent the remaining weight, and the value at that index will represent the count of that weight.

6. Remove unnecessary checks and assignments: The code checks if `v != 0` before updating `best_w` and `remain`, but since `v` is initially set to a positive value, this check is redundant. Additionally, the assignment `x[best_w]--` can be moved inside the `if` condition to avoid unnecessary assignments when `best_w` is not updated.

7. Use a more efficient loop construct: The range-based `for` loop used to iterate over the vector `a` can be optimized by using a regular `for` loop with an index variable. This can potentially improve the performance by avoiding the overhead of obtaining the iterator for each iteration.

With these optimizations in mind, here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

int main() {
  int n_sets;
  std::cin >> n_sets;
  
  for (int set_number = 1; set_number <= n_sets; set_number++) {
    int n, W;
    std::cin >> n >> W;
    
    std::vector<int> a(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
      std::cin >> a[i];
    
    std::partial_sort(a.begin(), a.begin() + W, a.end(), std::greater<int>());
    
    std::vector<int> x(W + 1, 0);
    x[W] = 200000;
    
    for (int i = 0; i < W; i++) {
      int remain = W - a[i];
      int best_w = W;
      
      for (int j = W; j >= 0; j--) {
        if (j - a[i] >= 0 && x[j] != 0 && j - a[i] < remain) {
          best_w = j;
          remain = j - a[i];
        }
      }
      
      if (--x[best_w] == 0)
        x.erase(x.begin() + best_w);
      
      x[remain]++;
    }
    
    std::cout << 200000 - x[W] << std::endl;
  }
  
  return 0;
}
```

These optimizations aim to improve the performance by reducing unnecessary operations, using more efficient data structures, and leveraging optimized algorithms provided by the standard library.
