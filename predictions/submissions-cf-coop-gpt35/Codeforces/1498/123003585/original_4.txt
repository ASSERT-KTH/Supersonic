Code Analysis:
The given code is solving a problem that involves finding the maximum number of unique integers that can be selected from a given set such that their sum is equal to a target value. The code uses a map `x` to keep track of the count of selected integers and their remaining sum.

Potential Performance Bottlenecks:
1. Sorting: The code uses the `sort` function to sort the array `a` in descending order. This sorting operation has a time complexity of O(n log n), which can be expensive for large arrays.
2. Map Operations: The code performs frequent insertions, deletions, and lookups in the map `x`. These operations have a time complexity of O(log n), which can also add up to the overall running time.
3. Memory Allocation: The code allocates an array `a` of size `n` and a map `x`. These memory allocations can be inefficient for large input sizes.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Sorting: Since the array `a` only needs to be sorted in descending order, we can use a partial sort algorithm such as `std::partial_sort` or `std::make_heap` to achieve the same result with a lower time complexity.
2. Map Operations: Instead of using a map, we can use a vector to keep track of the count of selected integers. We can use the integer value as an index in the vector and increment or decrement the count accordingly. This will eliminate the need for map operations and reduce the time complexity to O(1).
3. Memory Allocation: Instead of allocating a fixed-size array `a` and a map `x`, we can use a vector for `a` and a vector for the count of selected integers. This will allow dynamic memory allocation and reduce the memory overhead.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Replace the `sort` function with a partial sort algorithm such as `std::partial_sort` or `std::make_heap`. This will reduce the time complexity of sorting from O(n log n) to O(n).
2. Replace the map `x` with a vector `count`. Initialize the vector with a size equal to the maximum value of the integers in the input array `a`.
3. Update the code to use vector operations instead of map operations. Use the integer value as an index in the vector `count` to increment or decrement the count of selected integers.
4. Replace the fixed-size array `a` with a vector `a` and dynamically allocate memory based on the input size `n`.
5. Update the code to use vector operations instead of array operations.

Optimized Code Block:
```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int n_sets;
  scanf("%d", &n_sets);
  for (int set_number = 1; set_number <= n_sets; set_number++) {
    int n, W;
    scanf("%d %d", &n, &W);
    vector<int> a(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
      scanf("%d", &a[i]);
    partial_sort(a.begin(), a.begin() + n, a.end(), greater<int>());
    vector<int> count(*max_element(a.begin(), a.end()) + 1);
    count[W] = 200000;
    for (int i : a) {
      int remain = W - i;
      int best_w = W;
      for (int k = W; k >= 0; k--) {
        if (k - i >= 0 && count[k] != 0 && k - i < remain) {
          best_w = k;
          remain = k - i;
        }
      }
      count[best_w]--;
      if (count[best_w] == 0)
        count[best_w] = 0;
      count[remain]++;
    }
    printf("%d\n", 200000 - count[W]);
  }
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized code reduces the time complexity of the sorting operation and eliminates the map operations, resulting in improved performance. It also uses dynamic memory allocation for the array `a` and the count vector, reducing memory overhead.
