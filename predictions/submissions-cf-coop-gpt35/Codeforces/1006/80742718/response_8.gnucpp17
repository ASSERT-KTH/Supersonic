The given code calculates the number of paths in a grid from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner, such that the bitwise XOR of the values along the path is equal to a given value `k`. The code uses a brute-force approach to iterate through all possible paths and count the number of valid paths.

To optimize this code, we can focus on the following areas:

1. Avoid unnecessary includes: The code includes unnecessary headers like `<bits/stdc++.h>` and `<unordered_map>`. We should remove these includes to reduce compilation time and improve code readability.

2. Remove unnecessary macro definitions: The code defines macros like `RT`, `watch`, `sz`, etc., which are not used in the code. We can remove these macros to simplify the code.

3. Replace `endl` with `"\n"`: The code uses `endl` to end lines in the output, which flushes the output buffer. This can be inefficient when printing a large amount of output. We can replace `endl` with `"\n"` to improve performance.

4. Avoid using `std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0)`: The code uses `std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0)` to synchronize C++ streams with C standard streams. While this can improve performance in some cases, it is not necessary in this code as there is no interaction between C++ streams and C standard streams.

5. Use a more efficient data structure: The code currently uses a 2D array to store the grid values and a map for counting the XOR values. We can optimize this by using a 1D array to store the grid values and a 2D array for counting the XOR values. This will reduce the memory usage and improve cache efficiency.

6. Reduce the number of XOR operations: The code currently performs XOR operations for each value along the path. We can optimize this by calculating the XOR value only once for each path and storing it in a variable. This will reduce the number of XOR operations and improve performance.

7. Optimize the loop conditions: The code uses two nested loops to iterate through all possible paths. We can optimize the loop conditions to avoid unnecessary iterations. For example, in the first loop, we can iterate until `1 << num` instead of `1 << (n + m - 2 + 1) / 2`, as the upper half of the bits will always be zero.

8. Use bit manipulation instead of division: The code uses `(n + m - 2 + 1) / 2` to calculate the number of bits required for the first loop. We can optimize this by using bit manipulation instead: `num = (n + m - 2 + 1) >> 1`.

9. Use a more efficient loop variable: The loop variable `j` in the second loop can be declared as `unsigned int` instead of `int` to avoid unnecessary sign extension during bit manipulation.

10. Use `unordered_map` instead of `map`: The code currently uses a `map` to count the XOR values. We can optimize this by using an `unordered_map`, which has a faster average lookup time.

11. Remove unnecessary break statement: The code uses a `break` statement inside the second loop when `row < 1` or `col < 1`. However, this condition is already checked before entering the loop, so the `break` statement is not necessary.
