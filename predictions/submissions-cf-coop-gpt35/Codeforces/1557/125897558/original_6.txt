Code Analysis:
1. The code reads an integer `test` as input, which represents the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, the code reads an integer `n`, followed by an array of `n` integers.
3. The code calculates the sum of all integers in the array and finds the minimum value.
4. If `n` is greater than 1, the code calculates the average of the array elements excluding the minimum value and adds the minimum value to it.
5. The final average is printed with precision up to 8 decimal places.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Use a more efficient data structure to store the array elements.
2. Avoid unnecessary calculations and use integer division instead of floating-point division where possible.
3. Remove the if condition for `n > 1` and perform the calculation for all test cases.
4. Avoid using `bits/stdc++.h` header as it includes unnecessary headers and can slow down compilation.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Replace the line `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` with the necessary headers required for `cin`, `cout`, `setprecision`, and `endl`:
   ```cpp
   #include <iostream>
   #include <iomanip>
   ```
2. Replace the line `int arr[n];` with a more efficient data structure like `vector`:
   ```cpp
   vector<int> arr(n);
   ```
   This eliminates the need to allocate memory dynamically and improves memory management.
3. Change the data type of `min` from `double` to `int` as we are storing the minimum value of the array elements:
   ```cpp
   int min = INT_MIN;
   ```
4. Modify the loop to calculate the sum and find the minimum value:
   ```cpp
   for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
     cin >> arr[i];
     if (arr[i] > min)
       min = arr[i];
     sum += arr[i];
   }
   ```
   Here, we use `+=` operator to add the current array element to the sum, which is more concise.
5. Replace the line `double ans = double((sum - min) / (n - 1)) + min;` with `int ans = (sum - min) / (n - 1) + min;`:
   ```cpp
   int ans = (sum - min) / (n - 1) + min;
   ```
   Since all the variables involved are integers, we can use integer division and avoid the overhead of floating-point division.
6. Move the calculation of `ans` and the output printing outside the if condition:
   ```cpp
   int ans = (sum - min) / (n - 1) + min;
   cout << setprecision(8) << ans << endl;
   ```
   This way, the calculation is performed for all test cases, avoiding unnecessary checks.
7. Remove the line `return 0;` at the end of the `main` function, as it is not necessary.

Optimized Code:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <iomanip>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int test;
  cin >> test;
  while (test--) {
    int n;
    cin >> n;
    vector<int> arr(n);
    int sum = 0;
    int min = INT_MIN;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      cin >> arr[i];
      if (arr[i] > min)
        min = arr[i];
      sum += arr[i];
    }
    int ans = (sum - min) / (n - 1) + min;
    cout << setprecision(8) << ans << endl;
  }
}
```
