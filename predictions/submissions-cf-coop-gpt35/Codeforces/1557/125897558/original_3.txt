Code Analysis:
1. The code reads an integer `test` which represents the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, the code reads an integer `n` which represents the number of elements in the array.
3. The code then reads the elements of the array and calculates the sum of the elements.
4. It also keeps track of the minimum element in the array.
5. Finally, if `n` is greater than 1, it calculates the average of the array elements excluding the minimum element and adds the minimum element to it.
6. The result is printed with a precision of 8 decimal places.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Avoid using `bits/stdc++.h` header as it includes unnecessary headers and can slow down the compilation process. Instead, include only the necessary headers like `iostream`, `iomanip`, and `limits`.
2. Avoid using variable-length arrays (`int arr[n]`) as they are not part of the C++ standard and can lead to undefined behavior. Instead, use `std::vector<int>` for dynamic arrays.
3. Avoid using `double` for intermediate calculations involving integers. This can lead to loss of precision and unnecessary floating-point operations. Instead, perform the calculations using integers and convert the result to `double` only when necessary.
4. Avoid using `std::endl` to flush the output stream after each line. This can be inefficient, especially when printing a large number of lines. Instead, use `'\n'` to insert a newline character and manually flush the output stream at the end of the program.
5. Use `static_cast` instead of C-style casts for type conversions. This provides better type safety and makes the code more readable.
6. Avoid unnecessary conditional checks and calculations. For example, there is no need to calculate the sum of the elements if `n` is less than or equal to 1.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Replace `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` with the necessary headers: `#include <iostream>`, `#include <iomanip>`, and `#include <limits>`.
2. Replace the variable-length array `int arr[n]` with `std::vector<int> arr(n)`.
3. Replace `double` with `long long int` for the `min` variable, as it is used to track the minimum element in the array.
4. Move the calculation of `sum` and `min` inside the loop to avoid unnecessary conditional checks.
5. Replace the division and floating-point addition in the calculation of `ans` with integer arithmetic. Calculate the sum excluding the minimum element and divide it by `n - 1`. Then add the minimum element to the result.
6. Replace `cout << setprecision(8) << ans << endl;` with `std::cout << std::fixed << std::setprecision(8) << ans << '\n';` to set the precision to 8 decimal places and use `'\n'` instead of `std::endl`.
7. Add `std::cout.flush();` at the end of the program to manually flush the output stream.

Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <iomanip>
#include <limits>
#include <vector>

int main() {
  int test;
  std::cin >> test;
  while (test--) {
    int n;
    std::cin >> n;
    std::vector<int> arr(n);
    long long int sum = 0;
    long long int min = std::numeric_limits<long long int>::min();
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      std::cin >> arr[i];
      sum += arr[i];
      if (arr[i] > min)
        min = arr[i];
    }
    if (n > 1) {
      long long int ans = (sum - min) / (n - 1) + min;
      std::cout << std::fixed << std::setprecision(8) << ans << '\n';
    }
  }
  std::cout.flush();
  return 0;
}
```

The optimized code makes the following changes:
1. It includes only the necessary headers.
2. It replaces the variable-length array with `std::vector`.
3. It uses `long long int` instead of `double` for the `min` variable.
4. It moves the calculation of `sum` and `min` inside the loop.
5. It performs the calculations using integer arithmetic instead of floating-point arithmetic.
6. It uses `std::fixed` and `std::setprecision` to set the precision of the output.
7. It manually flushes the output stream at the end of the program.
