The given code reads an integer `test_case` as input and then calls the `find_answer()` function `test_case` number of times. In the `find_answer()` function, it reads a double `array_size` and an array of doubles `data`, calculates the maximum value in the array, and then calculates the answer using the maximum value and the sum of all elements in the array.

There are several areas in this code that can be optimized for efficiency:

1. Unnecessary inclusion of headers: The code includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header, which is not recommended as it includes unnecessary headers and can slow down compilation. Instead, we should include only the necessary headers, such as `<iostream>` and `<iomanip>`.

2. Inefficient data structure: The code uses a C-style array `data` to store the input values. Using `std::vector<double>` instead of a C-style array can provide better memory management and performance.

3. Redundant computation: The code calculates the sum of all elements in the array twice - once in the loop and again when calculating the answer. We can eliminate the redundant computation by calculating the sum only once, inside the loop.

4. Unoptimized loop: The loop in the `find_answer()` function can be optimized by using pre-increment (`++i`) instead of post-increment (`i++`) for the loop variable `i`. This can potentially improve performance.

5. Compiler optimizations: We can suggest the use of compiler optimizations, such as loop unrolling or auto-vectorization, to improve the performance of the code. These optimizations are compiler-specific and can be enabled using compiler flags or pragma directives.
