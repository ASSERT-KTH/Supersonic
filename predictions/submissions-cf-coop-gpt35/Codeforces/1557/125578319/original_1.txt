Upon analyzing the given code, we can identify several potential areas for optimization:

1. Unnecessary inclusion of headers: The code includes both `<bits/stdc++.h>` and `<iomanip>`, which are not required for this program.

2. Inefficient use of the `double` data type: The array `data` is of type `double`, but the input values are read as `double` and then compared with `maximum`, which is of type `double`. However, the values in `data` are always integers, so it would be more efficient to use the `int` data type instead.

3. Inefficient use of `std::cin` and `std::cout`: The code uses `std::cin` and `std::cout` for input and output operations, respectively. However, these operations are relatively slower compared to other input/output methods. It would be more efficient to use `scanf` and `printf` functions for input and output.

4. Redundant calculation of sum: The sum of all elements in the `data` array is calculated using a loop. This can be optimized by using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series.

5. Inefficient loop structure: The loop in the `find_answer` function iterates from 0 to `array_size-1`, but the loop variable `i` is not used inside the loop. This loop can be optimized by using a range-based `for` loop.

Based on these observations, we can propose the following optimization steps:

1. Remove unnecessary headers: Remove the inclusion of `<bits/stdc++.h>` and `<iomanip>` as they are not required for this program.

2. Change the data type of `data` array: Change the data type of the `data` array from `double` to `int`.

3. Use `scanf` and `printf` for input/output: Replace the usage of `std::cin` and `std::cout` with `scanf` and `printf` functions for input and output operations, respectively.

4. Optimize the calculation of sum: Rather than calculating the sum using a loop, compute the sum of the arithmetic series using the formula `(n/2) * (first_element + last_element)`.

5. Optimize the loop structure: Replace the loop in the `find_answer` function with a range-based `for` loop.

Now, let's implement these optimization steps in the code block:
