The given code has a few potential performance bottlenecks and areas for optimization:

1. The use of `double data[100000]` creates a static array with a fixed size of 100,000. This can lead to wasted memory when the actual input size is smaller. Additionally, reading the array elements one by one using `cin` can be slow.

2. The `max` function is called inside the loop to find the maximum value in the array. This is an unnecessary computation since the maximum value can be found while reading the array elements.

3. The sum of all array elements is calculated using a loop, which can be optimized by using the `accumulate` function from the `<numeric>` library.

4. The loop in the `main` function can be parallelized using OpenMP directives to improve performance on multi-core processors.

Based on these observations, the following optimization strategy can be formulated:

1. Replace the static array `double data[100000]` with a dynamic array using `std::vector` to minimize memory usage.

2. Find the maximum value while reading the array elements and calculate the sum using the `accumulate` function.

3. Replace the loop in the `main` function with a parallelized loop using OpenMP directives.
