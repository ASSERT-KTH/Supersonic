First, let's analyze the code and identify potential performance bottlenecks and inefficient memory usage:

1. Inefficient memory usage: The code uses a 2D vector `adj` to represent the adjacency list. However, the size of `adj` is fixed to `n`, the number of nodes in the graph. This can lead to memory wastage if the graph is sparse, as many elements in `adj` will be unused.

2. Redundant computations: The functions `compute_depth` and `compute_below` both traverse the adjacency list in a recursive manner. This can lead to redundant computations, as the same nodes can be visited multiple times.

3. Sorting the score vector: The code sorts the `score` vector using `std::sort` in descending order. This operation has a time complexity of O(n log n), which can be improved.

Based on the analysis, the following optimization strategy can be formulated:

1. Efficient data structure: Replace the 2D vector `adj` with a more memory-efficient data structure. One option is to use an `unordered_map<int, vector<int>>` to represent the adjacency list, where each node is mapped to a vector of its adjacent nodes.

2. Avoid redundant computations: Modify the `compute_depth` and `compute_below` functions to avoid redundant computations. This can be achieved by keeping track of visited nodes and skipping already visited nodes during traversal.

3. Optimize sorting: Instead of sorting the entire `score` vector, we can use a partial sorting algorithm to find the top `k` elements. This can be achieved using the `std::partial_sort` algorithm, which has a time complexity of O(n log k).

Now, let's go through each optimization step in detail:

1. Efficient data structure: Replace the `vector<vector<int>> adj` with an `unordered_map<int, vector<int>> adj`. This will reduce memory usage by only allocating space for the adjacent nodes of each node, rather than allocating space for all nodes in the graph.

2. Avoid redundant computations: Modify the `compute_depth` and `compute_below` functions to keep track of visited nodes. This can be done by maintaining a `visited` vector of size `n` and setting the visited nodes to `true`.

3. Optimize sorting: Replace the `std::sort(score.begin(), score.end(), greater<int>())` with `std::partial_sort(score.begin(), score.begin() + k, score.end(), greater<int>())`. This will sort only the first `k` elements, resulting in better performance compared to sorting the entire vector.

Here's the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <ios>
#include <iostream>
#include <numeric>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

void compute_depth(int u, int p, unordered_map<int, vector<int>> &adj, vector<int> &depth, vector<bool> &visited) {
  visited[u] = true;
  for (int v : adj[u]) {
    if (!visited[v]) {
      depth[v] = depth[u] + 1;
      compute_depth(v, u, adj, depth, visited);
    }
  }
}

void compute_below(int u, int p, unordered_map<int, vector<int>> &adj, vector<int> &below, vector<bool> &visited) {
  visited[u] = true;
  for (int v : adj[u]) {
    if (!visited[v]) {
      compute_below(v, u, adj, below, visited);
      below[u] += below[v] + 1;
    }
  }
}

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(nullptr);
  
  int n, k;
  cin >> n >> k;
  
  unordered_map<int, vector<int>> adj;
  for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; ++i) {
    int u, v;
    cin >> u >> v;
    --u;
    --v;
    adj[u].push_back(v);
    adj[v].push_back(u);
  }
  
  vector<int> depth(n);
  vector<bool> visited(n, false);
  compute_depth(0, -1, adj, depth, visited);
  
  vector<int> below(n);
  fill(visited.begin(), visited.end(), false);
  compute_below(0, -1, adj, below, visited);
  
  vector<int> score(n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    score[i] = depth[i] - below[i];
  }
  
  partial_sort(score.begin(), score.begin() + k, score.end(), greater<int>());
  
  cout << accumulate(score.begin(), score.begin() + k, 0ll) << '\n';
  
  return 0;
}
```

This optimized code addresses the memory wastage issue by using an `unordered_map` for the adjacency list, avoids redundant computations by keeping track of visited nodes, and optimizes the sorting operation by using `std::partial_sort` instead of `std::sort`.
