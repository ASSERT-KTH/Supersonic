The given code appears to be a C++ program that takes an input value `n` followed by `n` integers. The program then performs some calculations on the input data and prints the results.

Upon analyzing the code, the following potential performance bottlenecks and areas for optimization can be identified:

1. Library Inclusion: The code includes the entire `bits/stdc++.h` library, which is not recommended as it includes unnecessary headers and can increase the compilation time. It is better to include only the required headers.

2. Macros: The code uses macros extensively for loop iterations and vector operations. While macros can provide convenience, they can also lead to code duplication and make it difficult to debug or understand the code. It is recommended to replace these macros with inline functions or templates.

3. Data Structures: The code uses a `vector` to store the input values and a `map` to perform some calculations. While these data structures are generally efficient, there might be more efficient alternatives depending on the specific requirements of the calculations.

4. Loop Optimization: The code contains two nested loops that iterate over the input values. These loops can potentially be optimized by eliminating redundant computations or by unrolling the loops.

5. Precision: The code uses `std::fixed` and `std::setprecision` to set the output precision. While this is necessary for the specific requirements of the program, it can impact performance. It is worth considering whether the precision can be reduced without affecting the results.

Based on these observations, the following optimization strategy can be formulated:

1. Replace the `bits/stdc++.h` library inclusion with the required headers.

2. Replace the macros with inline functions or templates to improve code readability and maintainability.

3. Analyze the data structures used in the code and identify more efficient alternatives, if any.

4. Optimize the two nested loops by eliminating redundant computations or unrolling the loops.

5. Consider reducing the output precision if it does not affect the results.

Now, let's proceed with the step-by-step explanation and optimizations.
