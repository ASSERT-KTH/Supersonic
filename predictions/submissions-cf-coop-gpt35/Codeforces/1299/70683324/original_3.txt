The provided code is a C++ program that takes an input integer `n` followed by `n` integers, and then performs some calculations on the input to produce a set of output values. The code uses various data structures and functions to achieve the desired result.

Upon analyzing the code, I have identified several areas that can be optimized to improve performance and reduce memory usage:

1. Unnecessary includes: The code includes unnecessary headers, such as `bits/stdc++.h` and `iostream`. These headers include a large number of other headers, which can increase compile time. It is recommended to include only the necessary headers.

2. Macros: The code uses macros for various purposes, such as defining loops (`fo`, `repA`, `repD`), defining common functions (`all`, `sz`), and defining constants (`endl`). Using macros can make the code harder to read and debug. It is recommended to replace the macros with inline functions or constants.

3. Data structures: The code uses several data structures, such as `map`, `vector`, and `pair`, which can be inefficient for large data sizes. Replacing these data structures with more efficient alternatives, such as arrays or custom data structures, can improve performance.

4. Redundant computations: The code performs some redundant computations, such as calculating the sum of elements in the `a` vector for each iteration of the loop. These computations can be avoided by calculating them once and storing the result in a variable.

5. Binary search optimization: The code uses a binary search algorithm to find a specific index in the `c` vector. This binary search can be optimized by avoiding unnecessary calculations and comparisons.

Based on these observations, I propose the following optimization strategy:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: Remove the unnecessary headers `bits/stdc++.h` and `iostream`.

2. Replace macros with inline functions or constants: Replace the macros `fo`, `repA`, `repD`, `all`, `sz`, and `endl` with inline functions or constants.

3. Replace data structures: Replace the `map` and `vector` data structures with more efficient alternatives, such as arrays or custom data structures.

4. Avoid redundant computations: Calculate the sum of elements in the `a` vector once and store the result in a variable.

5. Optimize binary search: Optimize the binary search algorithm by avoiding unnecessary calculations and comparisons.

Now, I will provide a step-by-step explanation of each optimization step and present the optimized code.
