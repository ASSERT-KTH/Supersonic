Upon analyzing the given code, there are several potential performance bottlenecks and areas for optimization:

1. Inefficient data structures: The code uses a `std::vector` of pairs to store the equations. This can be improved by using a more efficient data structure, such as a `std::array` or a simple array, as the number of equations is fixed and known in advance.

2. Redundant computations: The code computes the least common multiple (LCM) multiple times in the `lcm` function and inside the main loop. This can be optimized by computing the LCM only once and reusing it.

3. Inefficient loop: The main loop iterates over the equations and computes the current modulus and remainder for each equation. This can be optimized by combining the computation of modulus and remainder into a single step.

4. Unnecessary function calls: The code calls the `gcd` function multiple times within the loop. Since the values being passed to `gcd` are constant within the loop, this computation can be moved outside the loop and performed only once.

5. Unnecessary exit: The code calls `exit(0)` inside the `lcm` function, which terminates the program. This can be replaced with a return statement to exit the function and continue execution in the main function.

6. Unnecessary modulo operation: The code uses a modulo operation in the `binmul` function to handle even and odd values of `b`. This can be optimized by using bit shifting to check if `b` is even or odd, and perform the necessary computations accordingly.

Based on these observations, here is an optimization strategy:

1. Replace the `std::vector` of pairs with a `std::array` or a simple array to store the equations.

2. Compute the LCM only once and reuse it in the main loop.

3. Combine the computation of modulus and remainder into a single step in the main loop.

4. Move the computation of `gcd` outside the loop to avoid redundant function calls.

5. Replace the `exit(0)` statement with a return statement in the `lcm` function.

6. Optimize the `binmul` function by using bit shifting instead of modulo operation.

Here is the optimized code:

In this optimized code, the changes made are minimal yet effective. The code now uses a `std::array` instead of a `std::vector`, and the LCM is computed only once and reused. The computation of modulus and remainder is combined into a single step, and the `gcd` function is moved outside the loop to avoid redundant function calls. The `exit(0)` statement is replaced with a return statement in the `lcm` function, and the `binmul` function is optimized using bit shifting instead of modulo operation.
