Code Analysis:
- The code includes unnecessary headers, such as `<bits/stdc++.h>`, which can slow down compilation time.
- The `debug` macro is not used in the code and can be removed.
- The `fastIO` macro disables synchronization between C and C++ input/output, but it is not necessary in this code as there is no mixing of C and C++ I/O operations.
- The `NAME` macro is defined but not used in the code.
- The code includes unnecessary global variables, such as `rnd`, `PI`, `INF`, and `LINF`.
- The `gcd` and `lcm` functions are recursive, which can be inefficient for large inputs.
- The `gcdEx` function is recursive and can be optimized.
- The `binmul` function is recursive and can be optimized.
- The `solve` function can be optimized by removing unnecessary calculations.
- The `run` function can be optimized by reducing the number of function calls and unnecessary calculations.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Remove unnecessary headers: Remove the unnecessary `<bits/stdc++.h>` header and include only the necessary headers, such as `<cstdio>` for `printf` and `scanf`.

2. Remove unused macros and global variables: Remove the `debug` macro, `fastIO` macro, and the unused global variables (`rnd`, `PI`, `INF`, `LINF`, `a`).

3. Optimize the `gcd` function:
   - Replace the recursive implementation with an iterative one using a while loop.
   - This eliminates the need for additional stack frames and improves performance, especially for large inputs.

4. Optimize the `lcm` function:
   - Replace the recursive implementation with an iterative one using the formula `lcm(a, b) = (a * b) / gcd(a, b)`.
   - This eliminates the need for additional stack frames and improves performance, especially for large inputs.

5. Optimize the `gcdEx` function:
   - Replace the recursive implementation with an iterative one using a while loop.
   - This eliminates the need for additional stack frames and improves performance, especially for large inputs.

6. Optimize the `binmul` function:
   - Replace the recursive implementation with an iterative one using a while loop.
   - This eliminates the need for additional stack frames and improves performance, especially for large inputs.

7. Optimize the `solve` function:
   - Simplify the calculations by removing unnecessary steps.
   - Instead of using the `gcd` and `lcm` functions, use the formula `lcm(a, b) = (a * b) / gcd(a, b)` directly to calculate `curMod`.

8. Optimize the `run` function:
   - Remove the unnecessary calculations and function calls.
   - Simplify the loop by combining the calculations of `curMod` and `curR` into a single step.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Remove unnecessary headers:
```cpp
#include <cstdio>
```

2. Remove unused macros and global variables:
```cpp
#define debug(x) 238;
```

3. Optimize the `gcd` function:
```cpp
ll gcd(ll a, ll b) {
  while (b != 0) {
    ll temp = b;
    b = a % b;
    a = temp;
  }
  return a;
}
```

4. Optimize the `lcm` function:
```cpp
ll lcm(ll a, ll b) {
  ll d = gcd(a, b);
  a /= d;
  if (a > LINF / b) {
    printf("NO\n");
    exit(0);
  }
  return a * b;
}
```

5. Optimize the `gcdEx` function:
```cpp
ll gcdEx(ll a, ll b, ll &x, ll &y) {
  ll x0 = 1, y0 = 0, x1 = 0, y1 = 1;
  while (b != 0) {
    ll q = a / b;
    ll temp = b;
    b = a - q * b;
    a = temp;
    temp = x0 - q * x1;
    x0 = x1;
    x1 = temp;
    temp = y0 - q * y1;
    y0 = y1;
    y1 = temp;
  }
  x = x0;
  y = y0;
  return a;
}
```

6. Optimize the `binmul` function:
```cpp
ll binmul(ll a, ll b, ll mod) {
  ll result = 0;
  while (b != 0) {
    if (b % 2 == 1) {
      result = (result + a) % mod;
    }
    a = (a + a) % mod;
    b /= 2;
  }
  return result;
}
```

7. Optimize the `solve` function:
```cpp
ll solve(ll r1, ll mod1, ll r2, ll mod2) {
  ll g = gcd(mod1, mod2);
  if (r1 % g != r2 % g) {
    printf("NO\n");
    exit(0);
  }
  ll a = mod1 / g;
  ll b = (r2 - r1) / g;
  ll c = mod2 / g;
  ll x, y;
  gcdEx(a, c, x, y);
  x = (x % c + c) % c;
  ll k = binmul(b, x, c);
  ll ans = (r1 + k * mod1) % (mod1 * mod2 / g);
  return ans;
}
```

8. Optimize the `run` function:
```cpp
void run() {
  ll n, m;
  int k;
  scanf("%lld%lld%d", &n, &m, &k);
  ll l = 1;
  for (int i = 0; i < k; ++i) {
    scanf("%lld", &a[i]);
    l = lcm(l, a[i]);
  }
  if (l > n) {
    printf("NO\n");
    return;
  }
  ll r1 = ((-0) % a[0] + a[0]) % a[0];
  ll mod1 = a[0];
  for (int i = 1; i < k; ++i) {
    ll curMod = lcm(mod1, a[i]);
    ll curR = solve(r1, mod1, ((-i) % a[i] + a[i]) % a[i], a[i]);
    r1 = (curR % curMod + curMod) % curMod;
    mod1 = curMod;
  }
  if (r1 == 0) {
    r1 += mod1;
  }
  if (r1 + k - 1 > m) {
    printf("NO\n");
    return;
  }
  for (int i = 0; i < k; ++i) {
    if (gcd(l, r1 + i) != a[i]) {
      printf("NO\n");
      return;
    }
  }
  printf("YES\n");
}
```

  ll k = binmul(b, x, c);
  ll ans = (r1 + k * mod1) % (mod1 * mod2 / g);
  return ans;
