Upon analyzing the code, I have identified the following potential areas for optimization:

1. Avoid unnecessary includes: The code includes the `bits/stdc++.h` header, which is not recommended as it includes a large number of standard library headers. It is better to include only the required headers explicitly.

2. Remove unnecessary debug macro: The `debug` macro is defined but not used in the code. It can be safely removed.

3. Avoid unnecessary calculations in `gcd` and `lcm` functions: The `gcd` and `lcm` functions are called multiple times within the code. However, the `gcd` function can be simplified by using the `__gcd` function from the `<algorithm>` header, and the `lcm` function can be simplified by using the formula `(a * b) / gcd(a, b)`. This will eliminate the need for the recursive `gcdEx` function.

4. Optimize the `binmul` function: The `binmul` function uses recursion, which can be costly in terms of memory and performance. It can be optimized by using an iterative approach instead.

5. Avoid unnecessary modulo operations: The `binmul` function and the `solve` function use modulo operations multiple times. Since the values involved are already within the specified range, these modulo operations can be eliminated to improve performance.

6. Replace `std::vector` with a fixed-size array: The `std::vector` used in the `eq` variable can be replaced with a fixed-size array since the size is known at compile time. This can improve performance by eliminating the dynamic memory allocation overhead.

7. Use `scanf` instead of `std::cin` for input: The code currently uses `std::cin` for input, which can be slower compared to `scanf`. Switching to `scanf` can improve input performance.

8. Avoid unnecessary memory usage: The code uses an array `a` to store input values, which can be avoided by directly using the input values during computation.
