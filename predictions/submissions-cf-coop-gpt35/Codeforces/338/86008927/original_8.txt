The provided code appears to be solving a mathematical problem involving finding a sequence of numbers that satisfy certain conditions. To optimize this code, we can focus on the following areas:

1. Avoiding unnecessary computations:
   - The `gcd` function is called multiple times within the `lcm` function. We can optimize this by calculating the `gcd` only once and reusing the result.
   - The `lcm` function performs a division operation which can be expensive. We can optimize this by performing the division only if necessary, i.e., when `a > LINF / b`.
   - The `binmul` function uses recursion, which can be expensive for large values of `b`. We can optimize this by converting it to an iterative loop.

2. Optimizing loops:
   - The loop that calculates the `lcm` can be optimized by starting from the second element of the array and calculating the `lcm` iteratively. This avoids unnecessary function calls and improves the overall efficiency.
   - The loop that checks if the sequence satisfies the conditions can be optimized by using the `gcd` function to check the condition `gcd(l, r1 + i) != a[i]` directly, instead of calculating `r1 + i` for each iteration.

3. Compiler optimizations:
   - We can suggest enabling compiler optimizations, such as `-O2` or `-O3`, to let the compiler apply various optimization techniques automatically.
   - We can also suggest using the `-march=native` flag to generate code optimized for the host architecture.

Now, let's proceed with the step-by-step explanation of each optimization and provide the optimized code.
