This code appears to be solving a problem that involves calculating the maximum value of `x` such that a certain condition is satisfied. The code reads input values, performs some calculations, and outputs the result.

Let's analyze the code and identify potential areas for optimization:

1. Use of `#define` macros: The code uses several `#define` macros such as `js`, `all`, and `endl`. While these macros can be convenient, they can also lead to code bloat and potential performance issues. It would be better to replace these macros with inline functions or constants.

2. Input/Output functions: The code uses custom input/output functions (`read` and `print`) for faster I/O operations. However, these functions are implemented using character manipulation, which can be slower than standard I/O functions. It would be better to use `std::cin` and `std::cout` for input/output operations.

3. Data structures: The code uses arrays, vectors, and a structure to store and manipulate data. There might be opportunities to optimize the data structures to reduce memory usage and improve access times.

4. Loop optimization: The code contains multiple nested loops, including a loop that iterates over a vector. Loop optimization techniques such as loop unrolling or loop interchange might be applicable to improve performance.

5. Use of STL algorithms: The code uses `std::sort` to sort a vector. While `std::sort` is a highly optimized algorithm, there might be opportunities to use other STL algorithms or data structures to improve performance.

Based on these observations, let's formulate an optimization strategy:

1. Replace `#define` macros: Replace the `#define` macros with inline functions or constants.

2. Replace custom input/output functions: Replace the custom input/output functions (`read` and `print`) with `std::cin` and `std::cout` for input/output operations.

3. Optimize data structures: Analyze the usage of arrays, vectors, and the `Node` structure to identify potential optimizations. Consider using more efficient data structures or optimizing the existing ones.

4. Apply loop optimizations: Analyze the nested loops and the loop over the vector to identify opportunities for loop optimizations such as loop unrolling or loop interchange.

5. Utilize STL algorithms and data structures: Analyze the usage of `std::sort` and consider using other STL algorithms or data structures to improve performance.

Now, let's proceed with the step-by-step explanation and provide the optimized code.
