The provided code is a C++ program that solves a problem using binary search. The program reads input values, performs some calculations, and outputs the result.

Upon analyzing the code, I have identified several potential areas for optimization:

1. The use of unnecessary headers: The code includes the `bits/stdc++.h` header, which is not recommended for use in production code as it includes all standard headers. It is better to include only the necessary headers.

2. The use of macros: The code uses several macros, such as `js`, `all`, `endl`, `pai`, `ms`, `rep`, and `repp`. Macros can often lead to code that is difficult to read and debug. It is better to replace them with inline functions or constants.

3. The use of unnecessary functions: The code includes several functions that are not used in the main logic of the program, such as `qpow` and `gcd`. These functions can be removed to simplify the code and improve performance.

4. The use of unnecessary data structures: The code uses a vector (`p`) and an array of vectors (`s`) to store input values. However, these data structures are not efficiently used. It is better to use a map or a multi-map to store the input values, as it will improve the efficiency of searching and inserting elements.

5. The use of unnecessary loops: The code includes nested loops that iterate over the vector `s[i]`. However, these loops can be simplified or removed to improve performance.

6. The use of unnecessary variables: The code includes several variables that are not used or can be replaced with more efficient alternatives. For example, the variable `i` in the `check` function can be replaced with a loop variable.

Based on these observations, I propose the following optimization strategy:

1. Remove the unnecessary headers and macros.
2. Remove the unused functions.
3. Replace the vector `p` and the array of vectors `s` with a map or a multi-map.
4. Simplify or remove unnecessary loops.
5. Replace unnecessary variables with more efficient alternatives.

Now, let's proceed with the step-by-step explanation of each optimization step.
