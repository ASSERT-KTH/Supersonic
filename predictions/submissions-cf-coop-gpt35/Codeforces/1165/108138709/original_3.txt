The given code appears to be a C++ program that solves a problem by finding the maximum value of x such that a certain condition is satisfied. However, the code contains several areas that can be optimized for better performance:

1. Unnecessary includes: The code includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header, which is not a standard C++ header and can be replaced with specific headers that are actually used in the code. This will reduce the compilation time and unnecessary memory usage.

2. Excessive macro usage: The code uses several macros, such as `js`, `all`, `pai`, `ms`, `rep`, and `repp`, which can make the code harder to read and understand. It is recommended to replace these macros with inline functions or regular code to improve code maintainability.

3. Inefficient data structures: The code uses a vector `p` to store certain values and later sorts it. However, since the vector `p` is only used for sorting and binary searching, it can be replaced with a simple array to improve performance.

4. Redundant calculations: The `check` function performs some redundant calculations. For example, the line `repp(i, min(N - 1, x), 1)` can be simplified to `for (int i = x; i >= 1; --i)`. Additionally, the line `if (now == 0 or ned == 0)` can be replaced with `if (now == 0 || ned == 0)` for better readability.

5. Inefficient loop iterations: The `check` function iterates through the vector `s[i]` using a range-based for loop. However, since the loop modifies the elements of `s[i]`, it is more efficient to use a regular for loop with an index to avoid unnecessary copying.

6. Compiler optimizations: The code can benefit from compiler optimizations. Compiler flags like `-O2` can be used to enable optimizations, but it is also important to verify that the code behaves correctly after applying these optimizations.

Based on these observations, here is an optimized version of the code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <cstring>

using namespace std;

const int N = 2e5 + 7;
int n, m;
int k[N], t[N], sum;
int p[N], s[N][N];

bool check(int x) {
  memset(t, 0, sizeof(t));
  int now = x, ned = sum, cnt = 0;
  int i = lower_bound(p, p + m, x) - p;
  for (int i = x; i >= 1; --i) {
    now = min(now, i);
    if (now == 0 || ned == 0)
      break;
    for (int j = 0; j < s[i][0]; j++) {
      int it = s[i][j + 1];
      int buy = min(now, k[it] - t[it]);
      t[it] += buy;
      ned -= buy;
      now -= buy;
      cnt += buy;
    }
  }
  return x - cnt >= ned * 2;
}

void solve() {
  cin >> n >> m;
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
    cin >> k[i];
    sum += k[i];
  }
  for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
    int d, t;
    cin >> d >> t;
    p[i] = d;
    s[d][++s[d][0]] = t;
  }
  sort(p, p + m);
  int l = 1, r = sum * 2, ans = 1;
  while (l <= r) {
    int mid = l + r >> 1;
    if (check(mid))
      ans = mid, r = mid - 1;
    else
      l = mid + 1;
  }
  cout << ans << endl;
}

int main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(0);
  cout.tie(0);
  solve();
  return 0;
}
```

In this optimized version, unnecessary headers are removed, macros are replaced with regular code, inefficient data structures are replaced with arrays, redundant calculations are simplified, and loop iterations are optimized. Compiler optimizations can also be applied during the compilation process to further improve the performance of the code.
