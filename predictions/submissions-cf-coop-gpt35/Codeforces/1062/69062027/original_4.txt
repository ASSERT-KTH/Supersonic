Optimization Strategy:

1. Use a more efficient data structure for the `adj` vector: Currently, the `adj` vector is implemented as a vector of vectors. This can be optimized by using a single vector of pairs, where each pair represents an edge. This will reduce the memory usage and improve cache locality.

2. Avoid unnecessary computations in the `dfs1` function: The `dfs1` function currently uses the `remove` and `erase` functions to remove the parent node from the `adj` vector. This can be optimized by using a separate vector to store the children of each node. This will eliminate the need for removing and erasing elements from the `adj` vector.

3. Optimize the `combine` function: The `combine` function currently performs multiple comparisons and assignments. This can be optimized by using a more efficient approach. For example, instead of comparing all four values individually, we can find the maximum and minimum values in a single pass.

4. Use loop unrolling: The loop in the `build` function can be optimized by unrolling it. Unrolling the loop will reduce the number of iterations and improve cache locality.

5. Use compiler optimizations: Enable compiler optimizations, such as loop unrolling and function inlining, to further improve the performance of the code.

Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. Use a more efficient data structure for the `adj` vector:
   - Replace the `adj` vector with a vector of pairs, where each pair represents an edge.
   - Update the code to use the new data structure when accessing the adjacent nodes of a vertex.

2. Avoid unnecessary computations in the `dfs1` function:
   - Replace the `adj[s].erase(remove(adj[s].begin(), adj[s].end(), p), adj[s].end())` code with a loop that constructs a new vector containing only the children of the current node.
   - Update the code to use the new vector when accessing the adjacent nodes of a vertex.

3. Optimize the `combine` function:
   - Replace the current implementation of the `combine` function with a more efficient approach.
   - Iterate over the four values and find the maximum and minimum values in a single pass.

4. Use loop unrolling:
   - Unroll the loop in the `build` function by manually expanding it.
   - Update the code to use the unrolled loop.

5. Use compiler optimizations:
   - Enable compiler optimizations, such as loop unrolling and function inlining, by adding appropriate compiler flags or pragma directives.
