Code Analysis:

1. The code includes unnecessary header files, such as `<bits/stdc++.h>`, which includes all standard library headers. It is better to include only the required headers to reduce compilation time and avoid potential conflicts.

2. The code uses various preprocessor directives, such as `#define` and `typedef`, to define shortcuts for data types and constants. While this can make the code more concise, it can also make it less readable and harder to understand.

3. The code uses `using namespace std;`, which brings all names from the `std` namespace into the global namespace. This can lead to naming conflicts and make the code less maintainable.

4. The code uses `vector` and other STL containers but does not utilize their full potential. For example, the `all(v)` macro is unnecessary as it simply returns the range `[v.begin(), v.end())`.

5. The code uses a while loop to calculate `temp *= a` until `temp` exceeds `n`. This approach can be inefficient for large values of `n` and `a`.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Remove unnecessary header files and preprocessor directives to improve compilation time and code readability.

2. Replace the use of preprocessor directives with explicit code to improve code readability.

3. Avoid using the `std` namespace to prevent naming conflicts and improve code maintainability.

4. Simplify the logic for checking if `n` is divisible by `b` or if `n` is equal to `a` or `b`.

5. Use the `pow` function from the `<cmath>` header to calculate `temp = pow(a, i)` instead of using a loop.

Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. Remove unnecessary header files and preprocessor directives:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <cmath>
```

2. Replace preprocessor directives with explicit code:

```cpp
const int MOD = 1000000007;
const int MOD2 = 998244353;
const int MX = 1000000000;
const int nax = 100005;
const long double PI = 3.14159265;
```

3. Avoid using the `std` namespace:

```cpp
using std::cout;
using std::cin;
using std::endl;
```

4. Simplify the logic for checking if `n` is divisible by `b` or if `n` is equal to `a` or `b`:

```cpp
if (n % b == 1 || n % b == a || b == 1) {
  cout << "YES\n";
} else if (a == 1 && n % b == 1) {
  cout << "YES\n";
} else {
  cout << "NO\n";
}
```

5. Use the `pow` function to calculate `temp = pow(a, i)` instead of using a loop:

```cpp
if (a != 1) {
  ll i = 0;
  ll temp = 1;
  while (temp <= n) {
    if (temp == n || (n - temp) % b == 0) {
      cout << "YES\n";
      return;
    }
    i++;
    temp = pow(a, i);
  }
}
cout << "NO\n";
```

Optimized Code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <cmath>

typedef unsigned long long ull;
typedef long long ll;

void solve() {
  ll n, a, b;
  std::cin >> n >> a >> b;
  if (n % b == 1 || n % b == a || b == 1) {
    std::cout << "YES\n";
  } else if (a == 1 && n % b == 1) {
    std::cout << "YES\n";
  } else {
    if (a != 1) {
      ll i = 0;
      ll temp = 1;
      while (temp <= n) {
        if (temp == n || (n - temp) % b == 0) {
          std::cout << "YES\n";
          return;
        }
        i++;
        temp = std::pow(a, i);
      }
    }
    std::cout << "NO\n";
  }
}

int main() {
  int t = 1;
  std::cin >> t;
  for (int tc = 1; tc <= t; tc++) {
    solve();
  }
  return 0;
}
```
