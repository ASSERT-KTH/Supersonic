Code Analysis:
- The code includes a lot of unnecessary header files and typedefs that are not used in the program.
- There are several unnecessary macros defined, which can be replaced with their respective values for better readability.
- The code uses a lot of unnecessary checks and conditions, which can be simplified to improve efficiency.
- The loop in the solve() function can be optimized to avoid unnecessary calculations.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Remove unnecessary header files and typedefs.
2. Replace macros with their respective values for better readability.
3. Simplify conditions and checks.
4. Optimize the loop in the solve() function to avoid unnecessary calculations.
5. Compile the code with optimization flags to enable compiler optimizations.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Remove unnecessary header files and typedefs:
   - The code includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header file, which is not recommended as it includes a lot of unnecessary standard library headers. We can remove this line and include only the necessary standard headers instead.
   - The typedefs `ull` and `ll` are not used in the code. We can remove these typedefs.

2. Replace macros with their respective values for better readability:
   - Instead of using macros like `MOD`, `MOD2`, `MX`, `nax`, `MXL`, and `PI`, we can replace them with their respective values to improve code readability.

3. Simplify conditions and checks:
   - The condition `if (n % b == 1 || n % b == a || b == 1)` can be simplified to `if (n % b == 1 || b == 1 || n % b == a)` for better readability.
   - The condition `if (n % b == 1)` inside the `else if (a == 1)` block can be removed since it is redundant.

4. Optimize the loop in the solve() function:
   - The loop in the solve() function can be optimized to avoid unnecessary calculations.
   - Instead of multiplying `temp` by `a` in each iteration, we can keep multiplying `temp` by `a` until it becomes greater than `n`. This way, we can reduce the number of loop iterations and improve efficiency.

5. Compile the code with optimization flags:
   - We can enable compiler optimizations by using the `-O2` flag during compilation. This will allow the compiler to apply various optimization techniques to improve code performance.
