To optimize the given code, we can focus on the following areas:

1. Remove unnecessary header files: The code includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header, which is not necessary and can be replaced with specific header files that are actually needed. This will reduce the compilation time and unnecessary inclusion of unused code.

2. Simplify the namespace usage: Instead of importing the entire `std` namespace using `using namespace std`, we can use the specific objects and functions that are required. This will reduce the chances of name clashes and improve code readability.

3. Remove unnecessary preprocessor macros: The code includes multiple preprocessor macros that are not used in the program. These macros can be removed to simplify the code and improve readability.

4. Use more efficient data types: The code uses `ll` and `ull` types for `long long` and `unsigned long long` respectively. These larger data types can be replaced with smaller data types if the values being stored do not require the larger types.

5. Optimize the loop: The loop in the `solve()` function can be optimized by checking for the condition `(temp <= n)` in the loop itself instead of checking it multiple times within the loop. Additionally, we can use a while loop instead of a for loop to avoid unnecessary iterations.

6. Use modular arithmetic: The code uses the modulus operator to check for specific conditions. We can use modular arithmetic properties to optimize these conditions and reduce the number of operations.

Based on these optimizations, the optimized code is as follows:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

void solve() {
  int n, a, b;
  std::cin >> n >> a >> b;

  if (n % b == 1 || n % b == a || b == 1) {
    std::cout << "YES\n";
  } else if (a == 1) {
    if (n % b == 1)
      std::cout << "YES\n";
    else
      std::cout << "NO\n";
  } else {
    int temp = 1;
    bool flag = false;
    while (temp <= n) {
      if (temp == n || (n - temp) % b == 0) {
        flag = true;
        break;
      }
      temp *= a;
    }
    if (flag)
      std::cout << "YES\n";
    else
      std::cout << "NO\n";
  }
}

int main() {
  int t = 1;
  std::cin >> t;
  for (int tc = 1; tc <= t; tc++) {
    solve();
  }
  return 0;
}
```

These optimizations simplify the code, remove unnecessary macros, and improve the efficiency of the loop. The overall functionality and output of the original code are preserved.
