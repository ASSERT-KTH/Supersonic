The given code is an implementation of a segment tree data structure, which is used to efficiently query and update ranges of elements in an array. The code initializes two segment trees, `low` and `hig`, each with a size of `n`. The `low` segment tree is used to store the bitwise AND of all values within a range, while the `hig` segment tree is used to store the bitwise OR of all values within a range.

The main function reads input values for `k` (the logarithm of the segment tree size) and `q` (the number of queries to be performed). It then iterates over each query, updating the `low` and `hig` segment trees accordingly. After performing the queries, the code checks if the segment tree properties are maintained, and if so, prints the values stored in the `low` and `hig` segment trees.

To optimize this code for efficiency, we can focus on the following areas:

1. Improve memory usage: The code currently uses three separate vectors (`sand`, `sor`, and `lazy`) to store the segment tree data. We can optimize memory usage by using a single vector of pairs (`data`), where each pair stores the values for `sand`, `sor`, and `lazy`. This reduces the memory overhead and improves cache locality.

2. Optimize segment tree updates: The `update` function currently performs updates in a recursive manner, which can be inefficient for large segment trees. We can optimize this by using an iterative approach instead of recursion. Additionally, we can optimize the `push` function by checking if updates are necessary before performing them.

3. Optimize segment tree queries: The `get` function currently performs queries in a recursive manner, which can be inefficient for large segment trees. We can optimize this by using an iterative approach instead of recursion.

4. Compiler optimizations: We can suggest compiler optimizations or pragma directives to hint the compiler to optimize certain parts of the code, such as loop unrolling or vectorization.

Let's now go through each optimization step in detail.
