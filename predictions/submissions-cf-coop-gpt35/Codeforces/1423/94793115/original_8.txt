This code implements a segment tree data structure with two operations: `update` and `get`. The `update` operation updates the values in a range of the segment tree, while the `get` operation retrieves the values in a range of the segment tree. The code also includes a main function that reads input values and performs the necessary operations.

Upon analyzing the code, we can identify several potential areas for optimization:

1. Inefficient Memory Usage:
   - The `sand`, `sor`, and `lazy` vectors are initialized with size `n * 2`, which is unnecessary. The size of these vectors only needs to be `n` because the segment tree has `2 * n - 1` nodes. This can help reduce memory usage.

2. Redundant Computations:
   - The `upd` function performs bitwise OR operations on `sand`, `sor`, and `lazy` vectors. However, the same operation is already performed in the `update` function. We can avoid redundant computations by removing the `upd` function and performing the OR operations directly in the `update` function.

3. Potential Loop Optimization:
   - The `push` function is called recursively, which can lead to unnecessary function call overhead. We can optimize this by converting the recursive calls to iterative loops.

4. Compiler Optimizations:
   - We can suggest using compiler optimizations, such as loop unrolling or vectorization, to improve the performance of loops in the code.

Now, let's optimize the code step-by-step.
