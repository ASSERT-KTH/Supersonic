Upon analyzing the code provided, I have identified a few potential areas for optimization:

1. Inefficient Data Structure: The `sand`, `sor`, and `lazy` vectors are being used to store the state of the segment tree. However, since the segment tree is a complete binary tree, we can optimize the memory usage by using a single flat array instead of two separate vectors.

2. Redundant Computations: The `upd` function updates three different vectors (`sand`, `sor`, and `lazy`) with the same value. This can be simplified to a single update operation.

3. Inefficient Push Function: The `push` function is currently checking if `lazy[id]` is zero before performing any updates. However, since the `upd` function already updates all three vectors with the same value, we can remove this check and unconditionally update `il` and `ir`.

4. Inefficient Get Function: The `get` function is currently returning a pair of values. However, since the `sand` and `sor` vectors are updated together in the update function, we can simplify the `get` function to only return the `sand` value.

5. Unoptimized Loop: The main loop for checking the consistency of the segment tree (`cek` function) uses a range-based for loop. However, this loop can be optimized by using a traditional for loop with an index.

Based on these observations, I propose the following optimization strategy:

1. Replace the separate `sand`, `sor`, and `lazy` vectors with a single flat array to optimize memory usage.

2. Simplify the `upd` function to perform a single update operation instead of updating three different vectors.

3. Remove the unnecessary check in the `push` function and unconditionally update `il` and `ir`.

4. Modify the `get` function to only return the `sand` value, as the `sand` and `sor` vectors are updated together.

5. Replace the range-based for loop in the `cek` function with a traditional for loop.
