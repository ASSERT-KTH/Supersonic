Code Analysis:
- The code uses various preprocessor macros to define shortcuts for common operations, such as `pb` for `push_back`, `pob` for `pop_back`, `S` for `second`, `F` for `first`, etc.
- The code includes a large number of unnecessary header files, such as `bits/stdc++.h`, which includes every standard library header. This can lead to increased compilation time and unnecessary memory usage.
- The code defines a number of unnecessary constants, such as `mod` and `mod2`, which are not used in the code.
- The code uses a `vector` of `long long int` to store the dynamic programming array. However, since the maximum value of `N` is `1e6 + 15`, it would be more memory-efficient to use a `vector` of `int` instead.
- The code sorts the `divs` vector in descending order using `sort(divs.rbegin(), divs.rend())`. However, this sorting step is not necessary for the subsequent calculations and can be removed.
- The code uses a loop to calculate the sum of `dp` array elements from 1 to `n`. However, this can be simplified by using `accumulate` function from the `<numeric>` header.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Remove unnecessary header files.
2. Remove unnecessary preprocessor macros.
3. Change the `vector<long long int>` to `vector<int>` for the `dp` array.
4. Remove the unnecessary sorting of the `divs` vector.
5. Replace the loop for calculating the sum of `dp` array elements with `accumulate` function from `<numeric>` header.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Remove unnecessary header files:
   - The `<bits/stdc++.h>` header file includes every standard library header, which is unnecessary and can lead to increased compilation time and memory usage. Instead, include only the necessary header files.
   - Remove the line `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`.

2. Remove unnecessary preprocessor macros:
   - The preprocessor macros `pb`, `pob`, `S`, `F`, `FAST`, `vll`, `pll`, `mod`, `mod2`, `ld`, `pi`, `Endl`, and `endl` are not used in the code and can be removed.

3. Change the `vector<long long int>` to `vector<int>` for the `dp` array:
   - Since the maximum value of `N` is `1e6 + 15`, it would be more memory-efficient to use a `vector<int>` instead of `vector<long long int>`.
   - Change the line `vll dp(N);` to `vector<int> dp(N);`.

4. Remove the unnecessary sorting of the `divs` vector:
   - The sorting step `sort(divs.rbegin(), divs.rend())` is not necessary for the subsequent calculations and can be removed.
   - Remove the line `sort(divs.rbegin(), divs.rend());`.

5. Replace the loop for calculating the sum of `dp` array elements with `accumulate` function:
   - Instead of using a loop to calculate the sum of `dp` array elements from 1 to `n`, we can use the `accumulate` function from the `<numeric>` header.
   - Replace the lines:
     ```
     ll ans = 0;
     for (ll i = 1; i <= n; i++)
       ans += dp[i], ans %= mod;
     ```
     with:
     ```
     ll ans = accumulate(dp.begin(), dp.begin() + n + 1, 0LL) % mod;
     ```

Optimized Code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <numeric>
using namespace std;

const int N = 1e6 + 15;
const int mod = 1000000007;

void solve() {
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  vector<int> dp(N);
  dp[0] = 1;
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    int x;
    cin >> x;
    vector<int> divs;
    for (int j = 1; j * j <= x; j++) {
      if (x % j == 0) {
        divs.push_back(j);
        if (j * j != x)
          divs.push_back(x / j);
      }
    }
    for (auto x : divs) {
      dp[x] += dp[x - 1];
      dp[x] %= mod;
    }
  }
  int ans = accumulate(dp.begin(), dp.begin() + n + 1, 0LL) % mod;
  cout << ans;
}

int main() {
  solve();
  return 0;
}
```
