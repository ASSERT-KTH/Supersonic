First, let's analyze the given code and identify potential areas for optimization:

1. The code includes unnecessary headers, such as `bits/stdc++.h` and `ext/pb_ds/assoc_container.hpp`. We should remove these to minimize compilation time and reduce potential conflicts.

2. The code uses the `using namespace std` statement, which can lead to naming conflicts and make the code less readable. It is better to avoid this and explicitly qualify the standard library functions and types.

3. The code uses the `typedef` keyword to create aliases for types. While this can improve code readability, it can also lead to confusion and make the code harder to understand. We can replace the `typedef` statements with explicit type declarations.

4. The code uses the `tree` data structure from the `__gnu_pbds` library. While this data structure provides some useful features, it may not be necessary for the given problem. We should evaluate whether we can replace it with a more efficient data structure or algorithm.

5. The code uses the `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false)` statement, which disables the synchronization between C and C++ standard streams. This can improve runtime performance, but it may also lead to unexpected behavior when mixing C and C++ I/O functions. We should assess whether this statement is necessary for the given problem.

6. The code uses the `freopen` function to redirect standard input and output to files. This is useful for debugging purposes, but it adds unnecessary overhead in the final optimized code. We should remove these function calls.

Based on these observations, we can formulate an optimization strategy:

1. Remove unnecessary headers (`bits/stdc++.h` and `ext/pb_ds/assoc_container.hpp`).

2. Avoid using the `using namespace std` statement and explicitly qualify standard library functions and types.

3. Replace `typedef` statements with explicit type declarations.

4. Evaluate whether the `tree` data structure is necessary and, if possible, replace it with a more efficient data structure or algorithm.

5. Assess whether the `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false)` statement is necessary for the given problem.

6. Remove the `freopen` function calls.

Now let's proceed with the step-by-step explanation and optimization of the code.
