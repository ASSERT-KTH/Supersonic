The provided code is a program that takes an integer `t` as input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it takes an integer `n` followed by a string `s` as input. The program then tries to find a substring in `s` that matches the pattern "abacaba" and replaces any question marks ('?') in that substring with the appropriate characters such that the resulting string contains exactly one occurrence of the pattern "abacaba". If such a substring is found, it prints "YES" followed by the modified string. Otherwise, it prints "NO".

However, the code can be optimized in several ways to improve its efficiency and reduce memory usage. Let's go through each optimization step by step.

Step 1: Code Analysis
- The `counts` function is called for each modified string to check if it contains exactly one occurrence of the pattern "abacaba". This function has a time complexity of O(n*m), where n is the length of the string and m is the length of the pattern. This can be a performance bottleneck if the input strings are large.
- The `goto` statement is used to restart the loop when a valid string is found. The use of `goto` is generally discouraged as it makes the code harder to understand and maintain.

Step 2: Optimization Strategy
1. Avoid unnecessary string copies: Instead of creating a copy of the input string `s` in each iteration of the loop, we can directly modify the characters in `s`. This will reduce memory usage.
2. Precompute the count of occurrences of the pattern "abacaba" in the input string: Instead of calling the `counts` function for each modified string, we can compute the count beforehand and use it to check if the modified string contains exactly one occurrence of the pattern. This will reduce the time complexity of the solution.
3. Use a more efficient algorithm to find the pattern: Instead of checking each substring of `s` for a match with the pattern "abacaba", we can use a more efficient algorithm like the KMP algorithm to find all occurrences of the pattern in `s`. This will further reduce the time complexity of the solution.

Step 3: Explanation of Optimizations
1. Avoid unnecessary string copies:
   - Instead of creating a copy of the input string `s` in each iteration of the loop, we can directly modify the characters in `s` using the index `i` and `j`.
   - By doing this, we eliminate the need for creating a new string `ss` and copying the characters from `s` to `ss` in each iteration.
   - This reduces memory usage and improves efficiency.

2. Precompute the count of occurrences of the pattern "abacaba" in the input string:
   - Instead of calling the `counts` function for each modified string, we can compute the count beforehand and use it to check if the modified string contains exactly one occurrence of the pattern.
   - To do this, we can iterate over the input string `s` and count the number of occurrences of the pattern.
   - We can store this count in a variable `patternCount`.

3. Use a more efficient algorithm to find the pattern:
   - Instead of checking each substring of `s` for a match with the pattern "abacaba", we can use a more efficient algorithm like the KMP algorithm to find all occurrences of the pattern in `s`.
   - The KMP algorithm uses a preprocessed array called the failure function to efficiently match the pattern against the input string.
   - By using the KMP algorithm, we can find all occurrences of the pattern in `s` in linear time, reducing the time complexity of the solution.
