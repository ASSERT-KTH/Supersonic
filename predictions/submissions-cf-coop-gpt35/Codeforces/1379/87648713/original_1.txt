The given code is a C++ program that takes an integer `t` as input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it takes an integer `n` and a string `s` as input. The program then checks if there is a substring in `s` that can be replaced by the string "abacaba" to obtain a new string that contains exactly one occurrence of the string "abacaba". If such a substring exists, the program replaces all question marks in the substring with the character 'd' and outputs "YES" followed by the modified string. If no such substring exists, the program outputs "NO".

Upon analyzing the code, we can identify several potential areas for optimization:

1. Inefficient string comparison: The code uses a nested loop to compare each character of `s` with each character of `p`. This results in a time complexity of O(n^2), where n is the length of the input string. We can optimize this by using the `std::string::substr` function to extract substrings of the same length as `p` from `s` and compare them directly.

2. Redundant string copy: The code creates a copy of `s` for each iteration of the outer loop. This is unnecessary and can be avoided.

3. Inefficient counting: The code uses the `counts` function to count the number of occurrences of the string "abacaba" in a given string. However, this function uses a similar nested loop approach as mentioned in point 1, resulting in the same time complexity issue.

4. Inefficient string modification: The code uses a nested loop to replace all question marks in the substring with the character 'd'. This can be optimized by using the `std::string::replace` function to replace the entire substring in one step.

5. Unnecessary loop label and goto statement: The code uses a loop label and a goto statement to repeat the loop iteration. This can be replaced with a simple while loop.

Based on these observations, we can propose the following optimization strategy:

1. Replace the nested loop in the `counts` function with a direct comparison using `std::string::substr`.
2. Remove the redundant string copy in the main loop.
3. Replace the nested loop for string modification with a single call to `std::string::replace`.
4. Remove the loop label and goto statement, and replace them with a while loop.

Now, let's implement these optimization steps in the code.
