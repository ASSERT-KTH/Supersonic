Upon analyzing the provided code, I have identified a few potential optimization opportunities:

1. Unnecessary #includes: The code includes several unnecessary headers such as `<cmath>`, `<cstdio>`, `<cstring>`, `<iostream>`, `<map>`, `<queue>`, `<set>`, `<stack>`, and `<string>`. These headers can be removed to reduce the compilation time and improve performance.

2. Redundant macros: The code defines two macros, `mul_mod` and `add_mod`, but they are not used anywhere in the code. These macros can be safely removed to simplify the code.

3. Sorting unnecessary array: The array `A` is sorted using `std::sort`, but it is not used anywhere in the code. This sorting operation can be removed to save computation time.

4. Redundant memory initialization: The array `suf` is initialized with zeros using `memset`, but it is immediately overwritten in the following loop. This memory initialization is unnecessary and can be removed.

5. Loop optimization: The loop `for (int i = 1; i <= m; i++)` can be optimized to start from `i = m` and decrement `i` in each iteration. This avoids the need for the reverse loop `for (int i = m; i >= 1; i--)` to compute the suffix sum.

6. Loop unrolling: The loop `for (int i = 1; i <= m; i++)` can be unrolled and optimized to process two elements in each iteration. This reduces the number of loop iterations and improves performance.

7. Compiler optimizations: Compiler optimizations such as loop unrolling, function inlining, and vectorization can be enabled using appropriate compiler flags or pragma directives. These optimizations can improve the performance of the code without any changes to the source code.

Now, I will proceed to optimize the code step by step, explaining each optimization along the way.
