The given code appears to find the longest prefix-suffix palindrome for each input string. However, there are several areas that can be optimized:

1. Redundant Reverse Operation: The code reverses the input string twice in the function `remainingStringLongestPallindrome()`. This is unnecessary as we can reverse the string once and use it to find both the longest prefix and longest suffix palindrome.

2. Unnecessary String Substr Operation: The code uses `substr()` function multiple times to extract substrings. This can be avoided by using indices to directly access the required characters.

3. Inefficient Memory Usage: The code creates multiple string objects unnecessarily, which can lead to inefficient memory usage. Instead, we can use indices to manipulate the input string directly.

4. Vector Resizing: The code initializes the `lps` vector with a fixed size and resizes it later. It is more efficient to initialize the vector with the required size from the beginning.

Based on these observations, let's optimize the code step by step.

Optimization Steps:

1. Remove unnecessary includes and typedef:
   - The `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` includes a large number of unnecessary headers. We can remove it and include only the necessary headers, such as `<iostream>`, `<string>`, and `<algorithm>`.
   - The `typedef pair<int, int> pii;` is not used in the code and can be removed.

2. Remove unnecessary macros:
   - The macros `sf(x)`, `sfl(x)`, `pb`, `frr(i, a)`, and `frl(i, a)` are not used in the code and can be removed.

3. Remove unnecessary `fio` macro:
   - The `fio` macro is not necessary as we are not using C-style I/O. We can remove it.

4. Replace `cin` and `cout` with `scanf` and `printf`:
   - Using `scanf` and `printf` instead of `cin` and `cout` can improve the I/O performance. We can replace `cin` with `scanf("%lld", &t)` and `cout` with `printf("%s\n", ans.c_str())`.

5. Optimize the `kmp` function:
   - The `lps` vector can be initialized with the required size from the beginning instead of resizing it later.
   - Instead of using `lps.size() - 1` to access the last element of the `lps` vector, we can use the index `s.size() - 1`.

6. Optimize the `longestPrefixSuffixPallindrome` function:
   - Replace the `substr()` function calls with indices to directly access the required characters.
   - Remove the unnecessary `reverse` operations and use the reversed string to find both the longest prefix and longest suffix palindrome.
