Upon analyzing the given code, I have identified several potential areas for optimization:

1. Redundant Header Inclusion: The code includes the entire `<bits/stdc++.h>` header, which is generally not recommended as it includes many unnecessary headers. It is better to include only the necessary headers, such as `<iostream>`, `<vector>`, `<algorithm>`, and `<string>`.

2. Unnecessary Typedefs: The code uses typedefs for `pii`, `lli`, and `ll64`, which are not used anywhere in the code. These typedefs should be removed.

3. Inefficient Memory Usage: The code uses a vector `lps` to store the longest proper prefix which is also a suffix for each index of the input string `s`. However, the vector is not used for any other purpose except for returning its last element. Instead of using a vector, we can use a single integer variable to store the length of the longest proper prefix which is also a suffix. This will reduce the memory usage.

4. Unnecessary String Copying: In the `remainingStringLongestPallindrome` function, the code creates a new string `t` by concatenating the input string `s` with a "?" character and its reverse. This is done to find the longest palindrome in the remaining part of the string. However, we can achieve the same result without creating a new string. We can directly use the `kmp` function on the remaining part of the string by passing the index from where the remaining part starts.

5. Inefficient String Substr Operations: In the `longestPrefixSuffixPallindrome` function, the code uses the `substr` function to extract substrings from the input string `s`. This function creates new string objects and copies the required characters, which can be inefficient. Instead, we can use two integer variables to keep track of the start and end indices of the required substrings.

6. Redundant String Reversal: In the `longestPrefixSuffixPallindrome` function, the code reverses the `remaining` string twice to find the longest prefix and suffix palindromes. We can optimize this by reversing the `remaining` string only once and using two separate indices to iterate from the start and end to find the longest prefix and suffix palindromes.

7. Use of `endl` Instead of `'\n'`: The code uses `endl` to end lines while printing the output. However, `endl` flushes the output buffer, which can be expensive. It is better to use `'\n'` to end lines, which will provide better performance.
