The given code appears to be a program that performs a series of operations on a deque. The goal is to optimize this code for efficiency, with a focus on improving running time and minimizing memory usage.

After a thorough analysis of the code, the following potential performance bottlenecks and areas for optimization can be identified:

1. Input Reading: The code uses `scanf` and `cin` to read input values. However, `scanf` is generally faster than `cin` for reading integers. Therefore, it would be beneficial to replace `cin` with `scanf` throughout the code.

2. Data Structure: The code uses a `deque` to store the elements. However, a `deque` is not the most efficient data structure for this scenario. Since the program only performs operations at the front and back of the deque, a `vector` would be a more efficient choice. Using a `vector` would eliminate the need for the `pop_front` function and the associated function call overhead.

3. Loop Optimization: The main loop in the code iterates until the deque's front element becomes the maximum value. However, the code does not take advantage of the fact that the maximum value is known. Instead of repeatedly checking if the front element is equal to the maximum, the code can simply compare the front element once and break out of the loop if it is equal to the maximum.

4. Indexing Optimization: In the second part of the code, the program calculates the final element to output based on the query value. However, the calculation can be simplified by using modular arithmetic to wrap around the index, rather than subtracting `cnt + 1` and adding `1`.

Based on these observations, the following optimization strategy can be formulated:

1. Replace `cin` with `scanf` for faster input reading.
2. Replace the `deque` with a `vector` for more efficient data storage.
3. Optimize the main loop by breaking out of it once the maximum value is found.
4. Simplify the calculation of the final element using modular arithmetic.

Let's now implement these optimizations step-by-step in the code.
