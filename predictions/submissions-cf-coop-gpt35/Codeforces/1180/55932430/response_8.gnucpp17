The given code appears to solve a problem involving a deque data structure. The deque is initially filled with integers, and then a series of operations are performed on the deque. Finally, a series of queries are answered based on the state of the deque.

Upon analyzing the code, several potential areas for optimization can be identified:

1. The use of `deque<int>`: While a deque is a suitable data structure for this problem, using a `vector<int>` instead may provide better performance due to its contiguous memory layout. This would avoid potential cache misses associated with deque's non-contiguous memory allocation.

2. The use of `pair<int, int>`: The vector `v` is used to store pairs of integers. Instead of using `pair<int, int>`, a custom struct or class with two integer members can be used to reduce memory overhead and improve cache coherence.

3. The use of `scanf` and `printf`: The use of `scanf` and `printf` for input and output operations can be replaced with the more efficient `cin` and `cout` streams.

4. Optimization of the deque operations: The operations performed on the deque involve repeatedly popping the front elements and pushing them to the back. This can be optimized by using a circular buffer or by swapping elements directly.

Based on these observations, the following optimization strategy can be formulated:

1. Replace `deque<int>` with `vector<int>`.
2. Replace `pair<int, int>` with a custom struct or class.
3. Replace `scanf` and `printf` with `cin` and `cout`.
4. Optimize the deque operations to avoid popping and pushing elements multiple times.
