The given code seems to implement a solution to a problem that involves manipulating a deque data structure. However, there are several areas of the code that can be optimized for better performance and memory usage. Let's analyze each part and propose optimizations:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The line `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` includes a large number of standard library headers. It is better to include only the necessary headers to minimize compile time and reduce the chance of namespace pollution.

2. Replace `scanf` with `cin`: The code uses `scanf` to read input values. However, `cin` is a safer and more convenient option for input reading. We can replace `scanf("%d", &temp)` with `cin >> temp`.

3. Avoid storing unnecessary data: The code uses a vector `v` to store pairs of integers. However, this data is not used for anything other than printing the output. We can remove this vector to save memory.

4. Optimize the deque manipulation loop: The loop that manipulates the deque can be optimized in several ways:
   a. Instead of repeatedly calling `pop_front` to get the front elements, we can use a single iterator to traverse the deque.
   b. Instead of using `push_front` and `push_back`, we can use `emplace_back` to directly append elements to the end of the deque. This avoids unnecessary copying of elements.
   c. We can avoid using `make_pair` and use direct initialization of the pair. This is more efficient as it avoids unnecessary function calls.

5. Optimize the handling of queries: The code handles queries by iterating over a vector `finalarray`. However, this vector can be replaced with a simple calculation to find the correct element based on the query value.

6. Remove unnecessary typedefs: The typedefs for `ULL` and `LL` are not used in the code and can be removed.
