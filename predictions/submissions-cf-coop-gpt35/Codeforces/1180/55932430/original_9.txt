Analysis:
1. The code uses a deque to store integers. Deque is a double-ended queue that allows efficient insertion and deletion at both ends. However, it is not the most efficient data structure for this problem, as there are multiple operations that require accessing and modifying elements in the middle of the deque.
2. The code uses a vector of pairs to store the values of a and b for each step in the algorithm. This can be optimized to reduce memory usage.
3. The code uses a while loop to perform the sorting algorithm. A more efficient sorting algorithm can be used.
4. The code uses a vector to store the final sorted array. This can be optimized to reduce memory usage.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Replace the deque with a vector. This will allow efficient access and modification of elements in the middle of the vector. The elements can be inserted and removed from the end of the vector using the push_back and pop_back functions.
2. Replace the vector of pairs with two separate vectors for a and b. This will reduce memory usage, as we only need to store the values of a and b for each step.
3. Replace the while loop with a more efficient sorting algorithm, such as quicksort or mergesort. This will reduce the number of comparisons and swaps needed to sort the array.
4. Replace the vector for the final sorted array with a single integer to store the maximum value. This will further reduce memory usage.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Replace the deque with a vector:
   - Replace the declaration of deque<int> deq with vector<int> deq.
   - Replace the function pop_front with a custom function that removes the first element of the vector and returns its value.
   - Update the implementation of the custom function pop_front to remove and return the first element of the vector using the erase function.
   - Update the implementation of the while loop to use the custom function pop_front instead of the pop_front function for deque.
   - Update the implementation of the if statement inside the while loop to check if deq[0] == mx instead of deq.front() == mx.
2. Replace the vector of pairs with two separate vectors:
   - Declare two vectors, vector<int> a and vector<int> b, to store the values of a and b for each step.
   - Inside the while loop, instead of pushing the pair (a, b) into the vector v, push the values of a and b into the vectors a and b.
3. Replace the while loop with a more efficient sorting algorithm:
   - After the while loop, sort the vectors a and b together based on the values of a.
   - This can be done by creating a vector<pair<int, int>> ab and populating it with pairs (a[i], b[i]) for each i.
   - Use the sort function to sort the vector ab based on the first value of each pair.
   - After sorting, update the vectors a and b with the sorted values.
4. Replace the vector for the final sorted array with a single integer:
   - Declare a single integer sorted_max to store the maximum value.
   - Inside the while loop, instead of pushing each element into the vector finalarray, update sorted_max with the maximum value.
   - After the while loop, remove the declaration and usage of the vector finalarray.

Optimized Code:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
typedef unsigned long long ULL;
typedef long long LL;
#define FOR(i, a, b) for (int i = (a); i <= (b); ++i)
#define REP(i, n) FOR(i, 0, (int)(n - 1))
using namespace std;

int pop_front(vector<int>& v) {
  int a = v[0];
  v.erase(v.begin());
  return a;
}

int main() {
  int n, q;
  cin >> n >> q;
  vector<int> deq;
  vector<int> a;
  vector<int> b;
  int mx = -1;
  int pos;
  REP(i, n) {
    int temp;
    scanf("%d", &temp);
    deq.push_back(temp);
    if (temp > mx) {
      mx = temp;
      pos = i;
    }
  }
  int cnt = 0;
  while (true) {
    if (deq[0] == mx) {
      break;
    }
    int a_val = pop_front(deq);
    int b_val = pop_front(deq);
    if (a_val > b_val) {
      deq.insert(deq.begin(), a_val);
      deq.push_back(b_val);
    } else {
      deq.insert(deq.begin(), b_val);
      deq.push_back(a_val);
    }
    a.push_back(a_val);
    b.push_back(b_val);
    cnt++;
  }

  vector<pair<int, int>> ab;
  REP(i, cnt) {
    ab.push_back(make_pair(a[i], b[i]));
  }
  sort(ab.begin(), ab.end());

  REP(i, cnt) {
    a[i] = ab[i].first;
    b[i] = ab[i].second;
  }

  REP(i, q) {
    LL query;
    cin >> query;
    if (query <= cnt) {
      printf("%d %d\n", a[query - 1], b[query - 1]);
    } else {
      query -= cnt + 1;
      query %= n - 1;
      printf("%d %d\n", mx, b[query + 1]);
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Trade-offs:
1. The optimized code introduces a few additional variables and data structures to improve efficiency. This may slightly increase the code complexity, but the improvements in performance and memory usage outweigh the added complexity.
2. The optimized code uses the erase function to remove elements from the vector deq. This operation has a complexity of O(n), where n is the number of elements in the vector. However, since the vector is small and the number of elements to be removed is limited, the impact on performance is negligible.
