The given code appears to solve a problem involving arrays `n` and `m`. It reads input values for `N` and `M`, and then fills the arrays `n` and `m` with additional values. It calculates `ans` by iterating through `n` and `m` arrays using nested loops. The code uses binary search to find the maximum `ans` value.

To optimize this code, we can focus on the following areas:

1. Minimize unnecessary calculations: The code currently calculates the cumulative sums for both `n` and `m` arrays. However, we only need to calculate the cumulative sums once before the main loop. We can move these calculations outside the loops to avoid redundant computations.

2. Use more efficient data structures: The code currently uses arrays `n` and `m` to store the cumulative sums. However, we can use `vector` containers instead, which provide better memory management and resizing capabilities.

3. Improve binary search efficiency: The binary search algorithm can be optimized by using a different approach. Instead of performing two nested loops, we can use a single loop and leverage prefix sums to calculate `s_n` and `s_m` values. This approach will reduce the time complexity and improve performance.

4. Use appropriate data types: The code uses `long long` for array indices and loop variables. However, `int` data type should be sufficient for these variables, as the maximum values for `N` and `M` are given as input.

Here is the optimized code with explanations for each optimization step:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int N, M, x;
  cin >> N >> M;

  // Step 1: Calculate cumulative sums for n and m arrays
  vector<long long> n(N + 1), m(M + 1);
  for (int i = 1; i <= N; i++) {
    cin >> n[i];
    n[i] += n[i - 1];
  }
  for (int j = 1; j <= M; j++) {
    cin >> m[j];
    m[j] += m[j - 1];
  }

  cin >> x;
  long long ans = 0;

  // Step 3: Optimize binary search using prefix sums
  for (int n_i = 1; n_i <= N; n_i++) {
    int min_m = 1, max_m = M;
    while (min_m <= max_m) {
      int mid_m = (min_m + max_m) / 2;

      // Calculate s_n and s_m using prefix sums
      long long s_n = n[n_i] - n[n_i - 1];
      long long s_m = m[mid_m] - m[mid_m - 1];

      if (s_m * s_n <= x) {
        ans = max(ans, static_cast<long long>(mid_m * n_i));
        min_m = mid_m + 1;
      } else {
        max_m = mid_m - 1;
      }
    }
  }

  cout << ans;
  return 0;
}
```

By following the optimization steps outlined above, we have minimized redundant calculations, used more efficient data structures, improved the binary search algorithm, and used appropriate data types. This should result in improved performance and reduced memory usage compared to the original code.
