Upon analyzing the code, I have identified several potential areas for optimization:

1. Inefficient Data Structures: The arrays `n` and `m` are declared with a fixed size of 2001, which may be excessive and result in unnecessary memory usage. We can optimize this by dynamically allocating memory based on the input size.

2. Redundant Computations: The code performs multiple calculations of the cumulative sum (`n[i] - n[i - n_i]` and `m[i] - m[i - mid_m]`) within nested loops. These calculations can be simplified and optimized to avoid redundant computations.

3. Loop Optimization: The nested loops that iterate over `n_i` and `mid_m` can be optimized by reducing the number of iterations or applying loop unrolling.

4. Compiler Optimizations: We can suggest compiler optimizations, such as using optimization flags or pragma directives, to hint the compiler to optimize certain sections of the code.

Now, let's proceed with the step-by-step explanation of the optimization strategy.
