The given code is a program that reads in two integers N and M, followed by N and M elements for two arrays n[] and m[] respectively. It then reads in another integer x. The program then performs a binary search to find the maximum size of a submatrix such that the product of the sums of its rows and columns is less than or equal to x. Finally, it outputs the maximum size of the submatrix.

Here are some potential optimizations for this code:

1. Use more appropriate data types: The code uses `long long` for array elements and loop variables, which may not be necessary. For example, using `int` instead of `long long` can save memory and improve performance. Since the problem statement does not specify the size of N and M, we can assume they are within the range of an `int`.

2. Remove unnecessary variable assignments: The variables `min_n`, `max_n`, `min_m`, and `max_m` are not necessary. We can directly use `1` and `N` for `min_n` and `max_n`, and `1` and `M` for `min_m` and `max_m` respectively.

3. Optimize the binary search: Currently, the code performs a binary search for each value of `n_i`. However, we can optimize this by performing the binary search only once and reusing the results for different values of `n_i`. We can calculate the minimum sum for each row outside the inner loop and store the results in an array. Then, within the inner loop, we only need to calculate the minimum sum for each column once and reuse the results for different values of `n_i`.

4. Use `vector` instead of arrays: Using `vector` instead of arrays can provide more flexibility and better memory management. We can dynamically allocate memory as needed and avoid any potential memory wastage.

5. Avoid unnecessary calculations: The code calculates `n[i] - n[i - n_i]` and `m[i] - m[i - mid_m]` multiple times for the same values of `i` within the inner loop. We can optimize this by calculating and storing these values outside the inner loop and reusing them.

6. Use `constexpr` for constant values: The constant values `10e10` can be replaced with `constexpr` variables to improve code readability and potentially allow for better compiler optimizations.

7. Use `std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false)` to improve input/output performance: By default, C++ synchronizes the C++ streams with the C streams, which can lead to slower input/output performance. By disabling this synchronization, we can improve the input/output performance.

Here is the optimized code with the mentioned optimizations:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

int main() {
  std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);

  int N, M;
  std::cin >> N >> M;

  std::vector<int> n(N + 1), m(M + 1);
  for (int i = 1; i <= N; i++) {
    int t;
    std::cin >> t;
    n[i] = t + n[i - 1];
  }
  for (int j = 1; j <= M; j++) {
    int t;
    std::cin >> t;
    m[j] = t + m[j - 1];
  }

  int x;
  std::cin >> x;

  std::vector<int> min_row_sum(N + 1);
  for (int i = 1; i <= N; i++) {
    int min_sum = INT_MAX;
    for (int j = i; j <= N; j++) {
      min_sum = std::min(min_sum, n[j] - n[j - i]);
      min_row_sum[j] = min_sum;
    }
  }

  int ans = 0;
  for (int n_i = 1; n_i <= N; n_i++) {
    int min_col_sum = INT_MAX;
    for (int mid_m = 1; mid_m <= M; mid_m++) {
      int s_n = min_row_sum[N] - min_row_sum[N - n_i];
      int s_m = m[mid_m] - m[mid_m - 1];
      min_col_sum = std::min(min_col_sum, s_m);
      if (s_m * s_n <= x) {
        ans = std::max(ans, mid_m * n_i);
      } else {
        break;
      }
    }
  }

  std::cout << ans;

  return 0;
}
```

These optimizations aim to improve both the running time and memory usage of the code. By using more appropriate data types, optimizing the binary search, and avoiding unnecessary calculations, we can achieve better performance. Additionally, using `vector` instead of arrays and enabling `std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false)` can further improve memory management and input/output performance respectively.
