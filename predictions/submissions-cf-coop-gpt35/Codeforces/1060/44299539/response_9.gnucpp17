The given code appears to be solving a problem that involves finding the maximum rectangle area in a grid, given certain constraints. However, there are several areas of improvement that can be made to optimize the code for efficiency. 

1. Avoid using the `bits/stdc++.h` header: This header includes a large number of standard library headers, which can significantly increase compilation time and memory usage. Instead, include only the necessary headers for your program, such as `<iostream>` and `<algorithm>`.

2. Use `int` instead of `long long`: The variables `n`, `m`, `s_n`, `s_m`, and `ans` can be safely changed to `int` data type, as the maximum value they can hold is within the range of an `int`.

3. Avoid unnecessary array initialization: The arrays `n` and `m` are initialized with zeros before being populated. However, this step is unnecessary since the array elements are directly assigned values later in the code. Removing this initialization step will save memory and execution time.

4. Use prefix sum arrays: Instead of calculating the sum of elements repeatedly in each iteration of the binary search loop, create prefix sum arrays `prefix_n` and `prefix_m` to store the cumulative sums. This will allow for constant time retrieval of the required sum in each iteration.

5. Use `std::numeric_limits<long long>::max()` instead of `10e10`: The constant value `10e10` is not an accurate representation of the maximum possible value for a `long long` variable. Instead, use `std::numeric_limits<long long>::max()` to represent the maximum value.

6. Use `mid_n` instead of `n_i` in the binary search loop: The variable `n_i` is used as a loop iterator in the outer loop, but it is also used in the binary search loop. To avoid confusion, rename `n_i` to `mid_n` in the binary search loop.

7. Use `std::max_element` instead of repeated comparisons: Instead of using a loop to find the maximum value in the `mid_m` array, use `std::max_element` algorithm from the `<algorithm>` header. This will simplify the code and improve its readability.

8. Optimize the binary search loop: The binary search loop can be optimized by removing unnecessary computations. The minimum value `min_m` can be set to `mid_m + 1` instead of `1`, and the maximum value `max_m` can be set to `M` instead of `M - 1`. This will reduce the number of iterations in the loop.

9. Use `std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false)` and `std::cin.tie(NULL)`: These function calls can improve the input/output performance of the code by disabling the synchronization of C++ streams with C streams.
