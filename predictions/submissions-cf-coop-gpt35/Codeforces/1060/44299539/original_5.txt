The given code appears to be solving a problem that involves finding the maximum area of a rectangle that satisfies a certain condition. The code uses binary search to find the optimal rectangle dimensions.

Upon analyzing the code, the following potential optimizations can be identified:

1. Unnecessary memory usage: The arrays `n` and `m` are being used to store cumulative sums. However, we can calculate the cumulative sums on the fly without storing them in arrays. This will save memory space.

2. Redundant computation: The code calculates the cumulative sums `n[i] - n[i - n_i]` and `m[i] - m[i - mid_m]` in each iteration of the inner loops. These calculations can be moved outside the loops to eliminate redundant computations.

3. Inefficient search space: The search space for the binary search is not being optimized. The maximum value of `min_m` is being set to `M` in each iteration of the outer loop. We can optimize this by setting the maximum value of `min_m` to `max_m + 1` after each iteration.

4. Compiler optimizations: We can use compiler optimizations and pragma directives to hint the compiler to optimize certain parts of the code. For example, we can use `-O3` optimization level and pragma directives such as `#pragma GCC optimize("Ofast")` to enable aggressive compiler optimizations.

Now, let's proceed with optimizing the code step by step.
