The provided code appears to solve a problem that involves finding the maximum area of a rectangle, with one side being a subarray from array `n` and the other side being a subarray from array `m`. The code uses binary search to find the maximum area that satisfies a given condition.

While the code seems to work correctly, there are several areas that can be optimized to improve performance and reduce memory usage. 

1. Avoid unnecessary memory usage: The code declares two arrays, `n` and `m`, with a fixed size of 2001. However, the size of these arrays is determined by the input values `N` and `M`. We can modify the code to dynamically allocate memory for these arrays based on the input size, which will avoid unnecessary memory usage.

2. Optimize input/output operations: The code uses `cin` and `cout` for input and output operations respectively. These operations can be slow, especially when dealing with large inputs and outputs. We can optimize this by using a faster input/output method, such as `scanf` and `printf`.

3. Optimize the binary search: The binary search in the code can be optimized further. Currently, it performs two nested loops to calculate `s_n` and `s_m` for each combination of `n_i` and `mid_m`. We can optimize this by precomputing the values of `n` and `m` arrays outside the binary search loop.

4. Use more efficient data types: The code uses `long long` for most variables, which may not be necessary in all cases. We can use more efficient data types, such as `int` or `unsigned int`, if the values are within the range of these data types.
