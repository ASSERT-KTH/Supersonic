Code Analysis:

1. The code includes multiple unnecessary header files, such as `<bits/stdc++.h>` and `<stdio.h>`. These can be removed as they are not used.

2. The code uses several macros for common operations like vector, pair, push_back, pop_back, etc. However, using macros for these operations can make the code less readable and error-prone. It is better to use the actual function names instead.

3. The code includes a lot of unnecessary typedefs and defines that are not used. These can be removed to simplify the code.

4. The code uses a global boolean array `prm[]` to check for prime numbers. However, this array is not used in the code and can be removed.

5. The code uses a global vector `factor` to store factors of a number. However, this vector is not used in the code and can be removed.

6. The code uses a global array `pascal_tri[][]` to store values of Pascal's triangle. However, this array is not used in the code and can be removed.

7. The code uses a global boolean array `vis[]` to mark visited nodes in the depth-first search (DFS). However, this array can be replaced with a local boolean array in the `dfs()` function.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Remove unnecessary header files: Remove the unnecessary header files `<bits/stdc++.h>` and `<stdio.h>` as they are not used in the code.

2. Replace macros with actual function names: Replace the macros with actual function names to improve code readability and avoid potential errors.

3. Remove unnecessary typedefs and defines: Remove the unnecessary typedefs and defines that are not used in the code to simplify the code.

4. Remove unused global arrays and vectors: Remove the unused global arrays `prm[]`, `factor[]`, and `pascal_tri[][]` to reduce memory usage.

5. Replace global boolean array with local array: Replace the global boolean array `vis[]` with a local boolean array in the `dfs()` function to avoid unnecessary global variable access.

6. Other optimizations: There are no other major optimizations that can be applied to this code. The main focus should be on removing unnecessary code and simplifying the existing code.

Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. Remove unnecessary header files: Remove the unnecessary header files `<bits/stdc++.h>` and `<stdio.h>` from the code.

2. Replace macros with actual function names: Replace the macros `v(i)`, `p(aa, bb)`, `pb`, `pp`, `co`, `ci`, `nl`, `fio(a, b)`, and `ios` with actual function names to improve code readability. For example, replace `v(i)` with `vector<i>` and `pb` with `push_back`.

3. Remove unnecessary typedefs and defines: Remove the unnecessary typedefs and defines that are not used in the code, such as `typedef long long ll`, `typedef unsigned long long ul`, `#define len (int)1e6 + 5`, `#define mod (ll)(1e9 + 7)`, etc.

4. Remove unused global arrays and vectors: Remove the unused global arrays `prm[]`, `factor[]`, and `pascal_tri[][]` to reduce memory usage.

5. Replace global boolean array with local array: Replace the global boolean array `vis[]` with a local boolean array in the `dfs()` function. Update the function signature to pass the `vis[]` array as an argument. This will avoid unnecessary global variable access and improve performance.
