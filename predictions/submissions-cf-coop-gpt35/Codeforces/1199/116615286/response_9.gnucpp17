This code appears to solve a problem involving matching and independent sets in a graph. However, there are several optimizations that can be made to improve its performance and memory usage. 

1. Remove unnecessary header files: The code includes several unnecessary header files, such as `<algorithm>`, `<climits>`, `<cmath>`, `<cstdlib>`, `<ctime>`, `<iostream>`, `<map>`, `<set>`, `<stack>`, and `<string>`. These header files are not used in the code and can be safely removed.

2. Remove unnecessary macro definitions: The code defines the macro `FAST`, which disables synchronization between the C and C++ standard streams. However, this macro is not used in the code and can be removed.

3. Replace `memset` with `std::fill`: The code uses `memset` to set all elements of the `match` array to zero. However, `memset` is not type-safe and may lead to undefined behavior. It is better to use `std::fill` instead, which is type-safe and provides a cleaner implementation.

4. Use range-based for loops: The code uses iterators to iterate over the elements of the `adj` vector. Instead, it can use range-based for loops, which provide a more concise and readable syntax.

5. Avoid unnecessary vector clear: The code clears the vector `v` after printing the output. However, this is unnecessary because the vector is immediately destroyed at the end of the loop iteration. Removing the `v.clear()` statement will improve performance slightly.

6. Optimize matching algorithm: The current matching algorithm has a time complexity of O(mn), where m is the number of edges and n is the number of vertices. This can be improved to O(m + n) by using a more efficient algorithm, such as the Hopcroft-Karp algorithm or the Edmonds' Blossom algorithm.
