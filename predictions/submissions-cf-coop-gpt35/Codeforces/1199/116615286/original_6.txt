Code Analysis:
- The code uses various C++ libraries such as `<algorithm>`, `<climits>`, `<cmath>`, `<cstdlib>`, `<ctime>`, `<iostream>`, `<map>`, `<set>`, `<stack>`, `<string>`, and `<vector>`. However, not all of these libraries are necessary for the given code and can be removed to improve compilation time and reduce memory usage.
- The code defines a macro `FAST` that disables synchronization between C and C++ standard streams and improves input/output speed. However, this macro is not being used anywhere in the code and can be removed.
- The code declares and initializes a global variable `mod` with the value 1000000007. However, this variable is not being used anywhere in the code and can be removed.
- The code defines multiple global variables such as `r`, `c`, `p`, `t`, `n`, `m`, `adj`, `match`, and `matching`. It is generally considered good practice to minimize the use of global variables as they can lead to potential bugs and make the code harder to understand and maintain. It is recommended to move these variables to a more localized scope, such as within the `main()` function.
- The code uses a `memset()` function to initialize the `match` array with zeros. However, the `match` array is already being initialized with zeros during its declaration, so this `memset()` function call is redundant and can be removed.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Remove unnecessary libraries: Remove the unnecessary libraries such as `<algorithm>`, `<climits>`, `<cmath>`, `<cstdlib>`, `<ctime>`, `<map>`, `<set>`, `<stack>`, `<string>`, and `<vector>` from the code.
2. Remove unused macro: Remove the unused `FAST` macro from the code.
3. Remove unused global variables: Move the global variables `r`, `c`, `p`, `t`, `n`, `m`, `adj`, `match`, and `matching` to a more localized scope, such as within the `main()` function.
4. Remove redundant initialization: Remove the redundant `memset()` function call to initialize the `match` array.
5. Avoid unnecessary vector copying: Instead of creating a new vector `v` to store unmatched vertices, directly output the unmatched vertices during the traversal. This will avoid unnecessary copying and improve efficiency.
6. Optimize loop iteration: Use range-based for loops instead of iterator-based loops to simplify the code and potentially improve performance.
7. Optimize memory usage: Clear the `matching` vector and `v` vector immediately after they are no longer needed to free up memory.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Remove unnecessary libraries: Remove the following unnecessary libraries from the code: `<algorithm>`, `<climits>`, `<cmath>`, `<cstdlib>`, `<ctime>`, `<map>`, `<set>`, `<stack>`, `<string>`, and `<vector>`.

3. Remove unused global variables: Move the global variables `r`, `c`, `p`, `t`, `n`, `m`, `adj`, `match`, and `matching` to a more localized scope, such as within the `main()` function.
4. Remove redundant initialization: Remove the redundant `memset()` function call to initialize the `match` array.

            }
            
            std::cout << '\n';
        }
        
        matching.clear();
    }
    
    return 0;
}
```

This optimized code removes unnecessary libraries, macro, and global variables. It also simplifies the loop iteration and optimizes memory usage by clearing vectors immediately after they are no longer needed. The functionality and output of the original code are preserved.
