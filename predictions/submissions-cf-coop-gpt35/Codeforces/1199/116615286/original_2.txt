After analyzing the provided code, I have identified several areas that can be optimized for efficiency:

1. Unnecessary includes: The code includes several unnecessary headers such as `algorithm`, `climits`, `cmath`, `cstdlib`, `ctime`, `iostream`, `map`, `set`, `stack`, and `string`. These headers are not used in the code and can be removed.

2. Redundant variables: The variables `r`, `c`, and `p` are not used in the code and can be removed.

3. Inefficient data structures: The code uses a vector of pairs (`vector<pair<int, int>>`) to represent adjacency lists. However, this data structure is not efficient for this particular problem. Since the maximum number of nodes is 3 * n, we can use a fixed-size array of vectors (`vector<int> adj[300005]`) to represent the adjacency lists. This will reduce the overhead of dynamically resizing the vectors.

4. Unnecessary memset: The `memset` function is used to initialize the `match` array to false. However, this is not necessary because the `match` array is already initialized to false when it is declared.

5. Inefficient loop: The loop that iterates over the adjacency list can be optimized. Instead of using an iterator, we can directly access the elements using the index. This will eliminate the overhead of iterator initialization and comparison.

6. Unnecessary clear: The `matching` vector is unnecessarily cleared at the beginning of each iteration of the while loop. We can remove this clearing step to improve efficiency.

Based on these observations, the following is an optimization strategy:

1. Remove unnecessary includes.
2. Remove unused variables.
3. Replace the vector of pairs with a fixed-size array of vectors.
4. Remove the unnecessary memset.
5. Optimize the loop that iterates over the adjacency list.
6. Remove the unnecessary clearing of the `matching` vector.

Now, let's proceed with the optimization steps:
