Code Analysis:
1. The code imports a large number of unnecessary libraries, such as `<bits/stdc++.h>` and `<cstdlib>`.
2. The code uses a lot of unnecessary global variables, such as `r`, `c`, `p`, and `mod`. 
3. The code uses `memset` to initialize the `match` array, which can be replaced with a simple loop.
4. The code uses a vector of pairs to represent the adjacency list, which can be replaced with a more efficient data structure.
5. The code uses a nested loop to find a matching, which can be optimized to reduce unnecessary iterations.
6. The code uses a vector to store the matching, which can be replaced with a fixed-size array to improve efficiency.
7. The code uses a vector to store the remaining vertices, which can be replaced with a fixed-size array to improve efficiency.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Remove unnecessary library imports to reduce compilation time.
2. Replace unnecessary global variables with local variables to reduce memory usage.
3. Replace `memset` with a simple loop to initialize the `match` array to reduce unnecessary function calls.
4. Replace the vector of pairs with a more efficient data structure, such as an array of vectors or a 2D array, to reduce memory allocation and improve cache locality.
5. Optimize the matching algorithm to reduce unnecessary iterations and improve efficiency.
6. Replace the vector used to store the matching with a fixed-size array to improve efficiency and reduce memory allocation.
7. Replace the vector used to store the remaining vertices with a fixed-size array to improve efficiency and reduce memory allocation.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Remove unnecessary library imports: 
   - Remove the line `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` as it includes unnecessary libraries.
   - Remove the line `#include <cstdlib>` as it is not used.
2. Replace unnecessary global variables:
   - Remove the lines `int r[4] = {1, 0, 0, -1};`, `int c[4] = {0, -1, 1, 0};`, `char p[4] = {'D', 'L', 'R', 'U'};`, and `int mod = 1000000007;` as they are not used.
3. Replace `memset` with a simple loop:
   - Replace the line `memset(match, 0, sizeof(match));` with a simple loop `for (int i = 1; i <= 3 * n; i++) match[i] = false;` to initialize the `match` array.
4. Replace the vector of pairs with a more efficient data structure:
   - Replace the line `vector<pair<int, int>> adj[300005];` with `vector<int> adj[300005];` to represent the adjacency list as an array of vectors.
   - Modify the code accordingly to use the new data structure (e.g., replace `adj[x].pb(make_pair(y, i));` with `adj[x].pb(i);`).
5. Optimize the matching algorithm:
   - Modify the loop `for (; it != adj[i].end(); it++)` to use an index-based loop instead of an iterator-based loop to improve efficiency.
   - Replace the nested loop with a single loop that iterates over the adjacency list once to find a matching. Use two arrays, `match` and `matching`, to keep track of the matching.
   - Break the loop as soon as a matching is found to avoid unnecessary iterations.
6. Replace the vector used to store the matching:
   - Replace the line `vector<int> matching;` with `int matching[n];` to use a fixed-size array to store the matching.
   - Replace `matching.pb(ed);` with `matching[i] = ed;` to store the matching in the array.
   - Modify the code accordingly to use the new array (e.g., replace `matching.size()` with `n` and `matching[i]` with `matching[i]`).
7. Replace the vector used to store the remaining vertices:
   - Replace the line `vector<int> v;` with `int v[3 * n];` to use a fixed-size array to store the remaining vertices.
   - Replace `v.pb(i);` with `v[i-1] = i;` to store the remaining vertices in the array.
   - Modify the code accordingly to use the new array (e.g., replace `v.size()` with `3 * n` and `v[i]` with `v[i-1]`).
8. Remove unnecessary memory clearing:
   - Remove the line `v.clear();` as it is not necessary.
