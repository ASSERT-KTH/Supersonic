Code Analysis:
- The code is using the `bits/stdc++.h` header, which includes several other headers. This can lead to longer compilation times and unnecessary inclusion of unused headers.
- The `FAST` macro disables synchronization between C and C++ standard streams, which can improve performance. However, it is not necessary in this code as it does not involve any input/output operations.
- The code includes unnecessary headers such as `<algorithm>`, `<climits>`, `<cmath>`, `<cstdlib>`, `<ctime>`, `<iostream>`, `<map>`, `<set>`, `<stack>`, `<string>`, and `<vector>`.
- The code is using a `typedef` for `long long` and `unsigned long long`, which can be replaced with the `using` keyword for improved readability.
- The code defines a global `mod` variable, which is not used anywhere in the code.
- The code uses magic numbers such as `4` and `300005` without any explanation.
- The code uses a fixed-size array for `r`, `c`, and `p`, which limits the flexibility and scalability of the code.
- The code uses a fixed-size array for `adj`, which limits the number of vertices that can be handled.
- The code uses a `memset` call to initialize the `match` array, which can be replaced with a loop for clarity.
- The code uses a nested loop to find a matching, which can be optimized.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Remove unnecessary headers: Remove the unnecessary headers such as `<algorithm>`, `<climits>`, `<cmath>`, `<cstdlib>`, `<ctime>`, `<iostream>`, `<map>`, `<set>`, `<stack>`, `<string>`, and `<vector>`.
2. Replace `typedef` with `using`: Replace the `typedef` for `long long` and `unsigned long long` with the `using` keyword for improved readability.
3. Use constants instead of magic numbers: Replace the magic numbers `4` and `300005` with constants and provide meaningful names for them.
4. Replace fixed-size arrays with vectors: Replace the fixed-size arrays for `r`, `c`, and `p` with vectors to allow for better flexibility and scalability.
5. Use vectors for adjacency list: Replace the fixed-size array `adj` with a vector of vectors for the adjacency list.
6. Initialize `match` array using a loop: Replace the `memset` call to initialize the `match` array with a loop for better clarity.
7. Optimize matching algorithm: Use a more efficient algorithm to find a matching.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Remove unnecessary headers:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
```
2. Replace `typedef` with `using`:
```cpp
using ll = long long;
using ull = unsigned long long;
```
3. Use constants instead of magic numbers:
```cpp
const int MAXN = 300005;
const int DIRECTIONS = 4;
```
4. Replace fixed-size arrays with vectors:
```cpp
std::vector<int> r = {1, 0, 0, -1};
std::vector<int> c = {0, -1, 1, 0};
std::vector<char> p = {'D', 'L', 'R', 'U'};
```
5. Use vectors for adjacency list:
```cpp
std::vector<std::vector<std::pair<int, int>>> adj(MAXN);
```
6. Initialize `match` array using a loop:
```cpp
std::fill(match, match + MAXN, false);
```
7. Optimize matching algorithm:
- Instead of using a nested loop to find a matching, we can use a greedy algorithm to find a matching in a single pass.
- Iterate over the adjacency list and check if the current node and its neighbor are unmatched. If they are unmatched, add them to the matching and mark them as matched.
- This approach will find a maximum matching in a graph with a complexity of O(N), where N is the number of vertices.
- Replace the existing matching algorithm with the optimized one.

Optimized Code:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

const int MAXN = 300005;
const int DIRECTIONS = 4;

std::vector<int> r = {1, 0, 0, -1};
std::vector<int> c = {0, -1, 1, 0};
std::vector<char> p = {'D', 'L', 'R', 'U'};

int t, n, m;
std::vector<std::vector<std::pair<int, int>>> adj(MAXN);
bool match[MAXN];

int main() {
    std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    std::cin.tie(0);
    std::cout.tie(0);

    std::cin >> t;
    while (t--) {
        std::cin >> n >> m;
        std::vector<int> matching;
        for (int i = 1; i <= 3 * n; i++) {
            adj[i].clear();
        }
        std::fill(match, match + MAXN, false);
        for (int i = 1; i <= m; i++) {
            int x;
            int y;
            std::cin >> x >> y;
            adj[x].emplace_back(y, i);
        }
        for (int i = 1; i <= 3 * n; i++) {
            if (match[i]) {
                continue;
            }
            for (const auto& neighbor : adj[i]) {
                int nd = neighbor.first;
                int ed = neighbor.second;
                if (!match[nd]) {
                    matching.push_back(ed);
                    match[nd] = true;
                    match[i] = true;
                    break;
                }
            }
        }
        if (matching.size() >= n) {
            std::cout << "Matching\n";
            for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
                std::cout << matching[i] << " ";
            }
            std::cout << '\n';
        } else {
            std::vector<int> v;
            for (int i = 1; i <= 3 * n; i++) {
                if (!match[i]) {
                    v.push_back(i);
                }
            }
            if (v.size() >= n) {
                std::cout << "IndSet\n";
                for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
                    std::cout << v[i] << " ";
                }
            } else {
                std::cout << "Impossible";
            }
            std::cout << '\n';
        }
    }
    return 0;
}
