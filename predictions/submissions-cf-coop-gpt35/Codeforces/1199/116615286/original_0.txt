Optimization Strategy:

1. Use a more efficient data structure: The current code uses a vector of pairs to represent the adjacency list. However, searching for a match within this structure can be inefficient. Instead, we can use an unordered_map or a set to store the adjacency list, which provides faster search operations.

2. Avoid unnecessary loop iterations: The code iterates over the entire adjacency list for each node. This can be avoided by using a set to keep track of the matched nodes and checking if a node has been matched before iterating over its adjacency list.

3. Remove unnecessary vector clearing: The code clears the "matching" and "v" vectors at the end of each iteration. However, this is not necessary since the vectors are cleared at the beginning of each iteration.

4. Optimize input/output: The code uses the "cin" and "cout" functions, which can be slower compared to other input/output methods like "scanf" and "printf". By using these faster alternatives, we can improve the overall performance of the program.

5. Remove unnecessary includes: The code includes multiple unnecessary header files. We can remove these includes to improve compilation time and reduce clutter.

Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. Replace the vector of pairs with an unordered_map: Instead of using a vector of pairs to represent the adjacency list, we can use an unordered_map. This will provide faster search operations when checking if a node has been matched.
```cpp
unordered_map<int, set<int>> adj;
```

2. Use a set to keep track of matched nodes: Instead of iterating over the entire adjacency list for each node, we can use a set to keep track of matched nodes. This will allow us to quickly check if a node has been matched before iterating over its adjacency list.
```cpp
set<int> matched;
```

3. Optimize the input/output operations: Replace the "cin" and "cout" functions with the faster "scanf" and "printf" functions. This will improve the overall performance of the program.
```cpp
scanf("%d", &t);
while (t--) {
    scanf("%d %d", &n, &m);
    // ...
    if (matching.size() >= n) {
        printf("Matching\n");
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            printf("%d ", matching[i]);
        }
        printf("\n");
        continue;
    }
    // ...
    if (v.size() >= n) {
        printf("IndSet\n");
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            printf("%d ", v[i]);
        }
    } else {
        printf("Impossible");
    }
    printf("\n");
}
```

4. Remove unnecessary vector clearing: Remove the unnecessary vector clearing statements for "matching" and "v" at the end of each iteration since they are already cleared at the beginning of each iteration.

5. Remove unnecessary includes: Remove the unnecessary includes for the header files that are not used in the code (algorithm, cmath, cstdlib, ctime, map, stack). This will improve compilation time and reduce clutter.
```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
#define FAST ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false), cin.tie(0), cout.tie(0);
#include <iostream>
#include <set>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <vector>
```

int main() {
  FAST;
  scanf("%d", &t);
  while (t--) {
    scanf("%d %d", &n, &m);
    matching.clear();
    adj.clear();
    matched.clear();
    for (int i = 1; i <= m; i++) {
      int x;
      int y;
      scanf("%d %d", &x, &y);
      adj[x].insert(y);
    }
    for (int i = 1; i <= 3 * n; i++) {
      if (matched.find(i) != matched.end())
        continue;
      for (int nd : adj[i]) {
        if (matched.find(nd) == matched.end()) {
          matching.push_back(nd);
          matched.insert(i);
          matched.insert(nd);
          break;
        }
      }
    }
    if (matching.size() >= n) {
      printf("Matching\n");
      for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        printf("%d ", matching[i]);
      }
      printf("\n");
      continue;
    }
    vector<int> v;
    for (int i = 1; i <= 3 * n; i++) {
      if (matched.find(i) == matched.end())
        v.push_back(i);
    }
    if (v.size() >= n) {
      printf("IndSet\n");
      for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        printf("%d ", v[i]);
      }
    } else {
      printf("Impossible");
    }
    printf("\n");
  }
}
```

This optimized code improves performance by using more efficient data structures, avoiding unnecessary loop iterations, optimizing input/output operations, and removing unnecessary includes. The changes made preserve the functionality and output of the original code while improving efficiency.
