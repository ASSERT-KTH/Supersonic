The provided code calculates a value based on an input number `n` and outputs the result. However, there are several areas where the code can be optimized for improved performance and memory usage.

1. The inclusion of the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header is not recommended as it includes all the standard library headers, which can lead to longer compilation times and potential conflicts. It is better to include only the necessary headers.

2. The `FASTIO` macro is unnecessary and can be removed. It disables synchronization between C and C++ standard streams, which might not be necessary in this case.

3. The `using namespace std;` statement brings all the names in the `std` namespace into the global namespace, which can cause naming conflicts. It is better to explicitly use the `std` namespace where needed.

4. The use of `ll` as a macro for `long long` is unnecessary and can be replaced with the `long long` type directly.

5. The code checks if `n` is odd and immediately outputs "0" if true. This check can be moved to the end of the code to eliminate the need for an `else` condition.

6. The expression `((n / 2) - 1) / 2` can be simplified to `(n - 2) / 4`. This eliminates the need for division and modulo operations.

7. The code can be optimized further by avoiding unnecessary calculations and reducing the number of operations.

Considering these points, the optimized code is as follows:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  long long n;
  std::cin >> n;

  if (n % 2 == 0) {
    std::cout << (n - 2) / 4;
  } else {
    std::cout << "0";
  }

  return 0;
}
```

This optimized code improves performance by simplifying the calculation and eliminating unnecessary operations. It also reduces memory usage by removing unnecessary headers and macros. The code is easier to read and understand without sacrificing functionality or output.
