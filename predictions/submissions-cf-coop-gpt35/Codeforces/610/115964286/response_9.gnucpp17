The given code calculates and prints a value based on the input number `n`. 

Let's analyze the code for potential optimizations:

1. The code includes unnecessary header files, such as `bits/stdc++.h`, which includes all the standard library headers. It is recommended to include only the necessary headers for better code organization and compilation time.

2. The code uses preprocessor macros `ll` and `FASTIO`. While using macros can improve code readability, they can also lead to unexpected behavior and make the code harder to debug. It is advised to use explicit type declarations and avoid unnecessary macros.

3. The code uses `using namespace std;`, which is generally considered bad practice because it pollutes the global namespace. It is better to explicitly specify the namespace for each standard library function used.

4. The code performs a check for `n` being odd or even using the modulo operator. This check is unnecessary because the subsequent calculation only depends on `n` being even. The code can be simplified by removing the check.

5. The code uses integer division (`/`) to calculate the result. However, for better accuracy, it is recommended to use floating-point division (`/`) or use the integer division result and then convert it to a floating-point number.

6. The code performs unnecessary calculations. The expression `((n / 2) - 1) / 2` can be simplified to `(n - 2) / 4`.
