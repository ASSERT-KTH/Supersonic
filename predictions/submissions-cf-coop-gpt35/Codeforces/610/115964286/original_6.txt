Analysis:

1. The code reads an input integer `n` and checks if it is odd or even.
2. If `n` is odd, it prints `0`.
3. If `n` is even, it calculates `(n/2 - 1)/2` and prints the result.

Potential optimizations:

1. The `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` header includes all standard headers, which can be unnecessary and slow down compilation time. We can replace it with the specific headers that are actually needed.
2. The `using namespace std;` statement imports the entire `std` namespace, which can lead to name clashes and increase compile time. It's better to avoid using this statement and explicitly qualify the names from the `std` namespace.
3. The `FASTIO` macro disables synchronization between C and C++ standard streams, which can improve input/output performance. However, it's not necessary in this code as there is only one input and output operation. We can remove this macro.
4. The code checks if `n` is odd by calculating `n % 2 != 0`. Instead, we can directly check `n % 2` for better efficiency.
5. The calculation `((n / 2) - 1) / 2` can be simplified to `(n - 2) / 4` without changing the result.
6. The code can benefit from using more descriptive variable names to improve code readability.

Optimization strategy:

1. Replace the `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` with the specific headers needed, such as `<iostream>`.
2. Remove the `using namespace std;` statement.
3. Remove the `FASTIO` macro.
4. Replace `n % 2 != 0` with `n % 2`.
5. Replace `((n / 2) - 1) / 2` with `(n - 2) / 4`.
6. Rename the variable `n` to a more descriptive name, such as `input`.

Optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  int input;
  std::cin >> input;
  
  if (input % 2) {
    std::cout << "0";
  } else {
    std::cout << (input - 2) / 4;
  }

  return 0;
}
```
