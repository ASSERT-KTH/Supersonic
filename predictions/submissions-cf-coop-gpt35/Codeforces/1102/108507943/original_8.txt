The given code seems to be solving a problem related to string manipulation. However, there are several areas where improvements can be made to optimize the code.

1. Avoid unnecessary includes: The line `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` includes a large number of standard library headers, which can slow down the compilation process. It is better to include only the necessary headers.

2. Avoid using `using namespace std;`: While using the `using namespace std;` directive can save some typing, it is generally considered a bad practice in large codebases. It is better to use the `std::` prefix to explicitly indicate that a name belongs to the standard library.

3. Avoid unnecessary type definitions: The line `#define int long long` is not necessary in this code and can be removed.

4. Avoid unnecessary function parameters: The `count` vector is passed as a parameter to the `forward` and `backward` functions, but it is not modified within these functions. It can be accessed directly within the functions without passing it as a parameter.

5. Avoid unnecessary conversions: The expression `s[i] - '0'` is used multiple times in the code to convert a character to an integer. It can be converted once and stored in a variable to avoid repeated conversions.

6. Use `const` references where possible: The `s` vector is passed by reference to the `forward` and `backward` functions, but it is not modified within these functions. It can be passed as a `const` reference to avoid unnecessary copying.

7. Optimize the forward and backward functions: The `forward` and `backward` functions can be optimized by using two pointers approach instead of iterating over the entire string. This will reduce the number of comparisons and assignments.

8. Use a more efficient data structure: The `count` vector is used to keep track of the count of each digit in the string. Instead of using a vector, a simple array of size 3 can be used since there are only 3 possible digits.

9. Optimize the counting loop: The loop that counts the occurrences of each digit can be optimized by using a switch statement instead of accessing the vector elements directly.

Taking these optimizations into consideration, the optimized code is as follows:
