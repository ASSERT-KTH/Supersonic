Code Analysis:

1. The code uses the `map` data structure to keep track of the cumulative sum and its corresponding index. However, using a `map` can be inefficient in terms of both time complexity and memory usage. Each insertion or access to the map has a time complexity of O(log n), which can slow down the program for large inputs.

2. The code uses an `if` statement for each character in the input string to update the cumulative sum. This results in redundant code and can be simplified.

3. The code initializes the `l` and `r` variables to 0, which can be avoided since the initial value is not used.

4. The code checks if `ans` is equal to 1e9 to determine if a solution exists. However, using a large value like 1e9 for comparison can make the code less readable.

5. The `sort` function is defined as a template function, but it is not used in the code.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Replace the `map` with a `vector` to store the cumulative sum and its corresponding index. This change will improve both time complexity and memory usage.

2. Use a switch statement instead of multiple if statements to update the cumulative sum based on the character in the input string. This change will simplify the code and reduce redundancy.

3. Remove the unnecessary initialization of `l` and `r`.

4. Change the comparison of `ans` to a smaller value, such as `INT_MAX`, which is more readable.

5. Remove the unused `sort` function.

Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. Replace the `map` with a `vector` to store the cumulative sum and its corresponding index. This change will improve both time complexity and memory usage.

```cpp
vector<int> mp(N, -1);
```

2. Use a switch statement instead of multiple if statements to update the cumulative sum based on the character in the input string. This change will simplify the code and reduce redundancy.

```cpp
for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
  switch (s[i]) {
    case 'L':
      sum += 1e9;
      break;
    case 'R':
      sum -= 1e9;
      break;
    case 'U':
      sum += 7;
      break;
    case 'D':
      sum -= 7;
      break;
  }
  if (mp[sum] != -1) {
    int left = mp[sum];
    int right = i;
    if ((right - left + 1) < ans) {
      ans = right - left + 1;
      l = left;
      r = right;
    }
  }
  mp[sum] = i;
}
```

3. Remove the unnecessary initialization of `l` and `r`.

```cpp
int l, r, ans = INT_MAX;
```

4. Change the comparison of `ans` to a smaller value, such as `INT_MAX`, which is more readable.

```cpp
if (ans == INT_MAX) {
  cout << "-1\n";
} else {
  cout << l << " " << r << "\n";
}
```

5. Remove the unused `sort` function.

Optimized Code:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
typedef long long ll;
const ll oo = 0x3f3f3f3f;
const ll OO = 0x3f3f3f3f3f3f3f3f;
const ll mod = 1e9 + 7;
const int N = 1.5e5 + 500;

void run_case() {
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  string s;
  cin >> s;
  s = " " + s;
  vector<int> mp(N, -1);
  ll sum = 0;
  int l, r, ans = INT_MAX;
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    switch (s[i]) {
      case 'L':
        sum += 1e9;
        break;
      case 'R':
        sum -= 1e9;
        break;
      case 'U':
        sum += 7;
        break;
      case 'D':
        sum -= 7;
        break;
    }
    if (mp[sum] != -1) {
      int left = mp[sum];
      int right = i;
      if ((right - left + 1) < ans) {
        ans = right - left + 1;
        l = left;
        r = right;
      }
    }
    mp[sum] = i;
  }
  if (ans == INT_MAX) {
    cout << "-1\n";
  } else {
    cout << l << " " << r << "\n";
  }
}

int main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(false), cin.tie(nullptr);
  int tc = 1;
  cin >> tc;
  while (tc--)
    run_case();
}
```
