**Code Analysis:**

Upon analyzing the given code, we can identify a few potential areas for optimization:

1. Redundant Sort Functions: The code includes two sort functions, one for vectors and one for strings. However, these functions are not used anywhere in the program. We can safely remove them to eliminate unnecessary code.

2. Unnecessary Use of `map`: The program uses a `map` to keep track of the sum of each prefix of the input string. However, the `map` is not really needed in this case. A simple array or vector could be used instead to achieve the same result with better performance.

3. Inefficient String Concatenation: The code concatenates a space character to the beginning of the input string `s`. This is done to simplify the indexing when accessing the characters of `s`. However, this operation has a time complexity of O(n) and can be avoided.

4. Inefficient Loop Iteration: The loop used to iterate over the characters of the input string could be optimized to avoid unnecessary iterations. Currently, it iterates over all characters, including the first space character. We can modify the loop to start from index 1 and end at index `n`, excluding the first space character.

5. Use of Magic Numbers: The code uses magic numbers like `1e9` and `7` to represent certain values. These magic numbers make the code less readable and harder to understand. It would be better to define named constants for these values to improve code readability.

6. Redundant Conditional Checks: The code includes multiple conditional checks to determine the type of character (`L`, `R`, `U`, `D`) and update the `sum` variable accordingly. However, these conditional checks can be simplified by using a lookup table or switch statements.

7. Inefficient Memory Allocation: The code uses an array of size `N` to store the input string. However, the actual size of the input string can be much smaller than `N`. This leads to inefficient memory allocation and a waste of memory resources.

**Optimization Strategy:**

Based on the identified areas for optimization, we can formulate the following optimization strategy:

1. Remove the unnecessary sort functions from the code.

2. Replace the `map` with a more efficient data structure, such as a vector or array, to store the sum of each prefix.

3. Avoid string concatenation by modifying the loop iteration to start from index 1 and end at index `n`, excluding the first space character.

4. Replace magic numbers with named constants for better code readability.

5. Simplify the conditional checks for character types by using a lookup table or switch statements.

6. Optimize memory allocation by using a dynamically allocated array for the input string instead of a fixed-size array.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. Remove the unnecessary sort functions from the code. These functions are not used anywhere in the program, so we can safely remove them.

2. Replace the `map` with a more efficient data structure, such as a vector or array, to store the sum of each prefix. The `map` has a higher memory overhead and slower access time compared to a vector or array. We can use a vector of `ll` (long long) to store the sum of each prefix.

3. Avoid string concatenation by modifying the loop iteration to start from index 1 and end at index `n`, excluding the first space character. This eliminates the need to concatenate a space character to the input string.

4. Replace magic numbers with named constants for better code readability. Define constants `LEFT_VALUE` and `UP_VALUE` to represent the values used to update the `sum` variable.

5. Simplify the conditional checks for character types by using a lookup table. Create a lookup table `charToValue` that maps each character to its corresponding value. Use this lookup table to update the `sum` variable based on the character type.

6. Optimize memory allocation by using a dynamically allocated array for the input string instead of a fixed-size array. The size of the input string can vary, so it is more efficient to allocate memory dynamically based on the actual size.

**Optimized Code:**

```cpp

#include <vector>

const int N = 1.5e5 + 500;

const ll LEFT_VALUE = 1e9;
const ll UP_VALUE = 7;

void run_case() {
    int n;
    cin >> n;
    
    char* s = new char[n+1];
    cin >> s;
    
    vector<ll> prefixSum(n+1, 0);
    prefixSum[0] = 0;
    
    int l = 0, r = 0, ans = 1e9;
  
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        prefixSum[i] = prefixSum[i-1];
        switch (s[i-1]) {
            case 'L':
                prefixSum[i] += LEFT_VALUE;
                break;
            case 'R':
                prefixSum[i] -= LEFT_VALUE;
                break;
            case 'U':
                prefixSum[i] += UP_VALUE;
                break;
            case 'D':
                prefixSum[i] -= UP_VALUE;
                break;
        }
        
        if (prefixSum[i] != 0) {
            if (prefixSum[i] == prefixSum[i-l]) {
                l = i - r;
            } else if (prefixSum[i] == prefixSum[i-r]) {
                r = i - l;
            }
            
            if ((r - l + 1) < ans) {
                ans = r - l + 1;
            }
        }
    }
  
    if (ans == 1e9) {
        cout << "-1\n";
    } else {
        cout << l << " " << r << "\n";
    }
    
    delete[] s;
}

int main() {
    ios::sync_with_stdio(false), cin.tie(nullptr);
    int tc = 1;
    cin >> tc;
    while (tc--)
        run_case();
    return 0;
}
