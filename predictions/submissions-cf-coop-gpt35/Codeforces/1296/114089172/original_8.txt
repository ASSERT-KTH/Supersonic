**Code Analysis:**

Upon analyzing the given code, the following potential performance bottlenecks and inefficient memory usage can be identified:

1. The code includes unnecessary header files (`<bits/stdc++.h>` and `<iostream>`), which can increase compilation time and use unnecessary memory.

2. The `sort` function templates are not used in the code, making them redundant and adding unnecessary code complexity.

3. The `map<ll, int> mp` is used to store the sum values and their corresponding indices. However, using a map requires additional memory and has a logarithmic time complexity for insertion and retrieval operations. 

4. The `sum` variable is updated based on the characters in the string `s`. However, the addition and subtraction operations are performed multiple times, even when the character is the same. This can be optimized to reduce redundant computations.

5. The `mp[sum]` is checked for non-zero value multiple times, which is not necessary and can be optimized.

6. The maximum value of `ans` is initialized to `1e9`, which is not a valid index value. This can lead to undefined behavior.

7. The `l` and `r` variables are initialized to `0`, which is not a valid index value. This can lead to incorrect results if the answer is `0`.

8. The `run_case` function is called multiple times in a loop with `tc` being decremented each time. However, the loop does not have any effect as `tc` is not used inside the loop.

9. The `ios::sync_with_stdio(false)` and `cin.tie(nullptr)` statements can improve input/output performance, but they are not necessary in this code as there are no interactions with C-style input/output functions.

**Optimization Strategy:**

Based on the code analysis, the following optimization strategy can be implemented:

1. Remove unnecessary header files (`<bits/stdc++.h>` and `<iostream>`).

2. Remove the unused `sort` function templates.

3. Replace the `map<ll, int> mp` with a simple array of size `N` to store the sum values and their corresponding indices. This will reduce memory usage and improve access time.

4. Optimize the update of the `sum` variable by checking the character in `s` only once and then updating the `sum` accordingly. This will reduce redundant computations.

5. Remove the unnecessary check for `mp[sum]` being non-zero multiple times and instead use a single check after updating the `sum` value.

6. Initialize `ans` to a large value instead of `1e9` to avoid undefined behavior.

7. Initialize `l` and `r` to `-1` instead of `0` to avoid incorrect results if the answer is `0`.

8. Remove the unnecessary loop in the `main` function.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. Remove unnecessary header files (`<bits/stdc++.h>` and `<iostream>`).

The unnecessary header files are removed as they are not used in the code.

2. Remove the unused `sort` function templates.

The `sort` function templates are not used in the code, so they can be removed to reduce code complexity.

3. Replace the `map<ll, int> mp` with a simple array of size `N` to store the sum values and their corresponding indices.

Instead of using a map, which requires additional memory and has a logarithmic time complexity for insertion and retrieval operations, a simple array of size `N` can be used. This will reduce memory usage and improve access time.

4. Optimize the update of the `sum` variable by checking the character in `s` only once and then updating the `sum` accordingly.

Instead of checking the character in `s` multiple times and performing addition or subtraction operations each time, the character can be checked only once and the `sum` can be updated accordingly. This will reduce redundant computations.

5. Remove the unnecessary check for `mp[sum]` being non-zero multiple times and instead use a single check after updating the `sum` value.

Instead of checking `mp[sum]` multiple times, a single check can be performed after updating the `sum` value. This will reduce unnecessary checks and improve performance.

6. Initialize `ans` to a large value instead of `1e9` to avoid undefined behavior.

To avoid undefined behavior, `ans` can be initialized to a large value instead of `1e9`. This will ensure that the comparison `if ((right - left + 1) < ans)` is valid.

7. Initialize `l` and `r` to `-1` instead of `0` to avoid incorrect results if the answer is `0`.

To avoid incorrect results if the answer is `0`, `l` and `r` can be initialized to `-1` instead of `0`. This will ensure that if `ans` remains unchanged, the output will be `-1 -1` instead of `0 0`.

8. Remove the unnecessary loop in the `main` function.

The loop with `tc` can be removed from the `main` function as it does not have any effect on the code.

    fill(mp.begin(), mp.end(), 0); // Initialize array with 0
    ll sum = 0;
    mp[0] = 1;

    int l = -1, r = -1; // Initialize l and r to -1
    int ans = oo; // Initialize ans to a large value

    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        ll val = 0; // Store the value to be added or subtracted from sum

        if (s[i] == 'L')
            val = 1e9;
        else if (s[i] == 'R')
            val = -1e9;

            val = 7;
        else if (s[i] == 'D')
            val = -7;

        sum += val;
        
        if (mp[sum] != 0) {
            int left = mp[sum];
            int right = i;
            if ((right - left + 1) < ans) {
                ans = right - left + 1;
                l = left;
                r = right;
            }
        }
        
        mp[sum] = i + 1;
    }

    if (ans == oo) {
        cout << "-1\n";
    } else {
        cout << l << " " << r << "\n";
    }
}

int main() {
    ios::sync_with_stdio(false), cin.tie(nullptr);

    run_case();
