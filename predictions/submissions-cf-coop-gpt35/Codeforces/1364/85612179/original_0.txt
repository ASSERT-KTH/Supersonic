After analyzing the given code, here are some potential optimizations that can be made:

1. Remove unnecessary header files: The code includes the entire `<bits/stdc++.h>` header, which includes many standard library headers. This can increase compilation time and use unnecessary memory. We can replace it with the necessary standard headers required by the code.

2. Avoid unnecessary typedefs: The code includes several typedefs for different types of unordered maps, maps, and pairs. These typedefs can make the code harder to understand and maintain. We can remove these typedefs and use the standard types directly.

3. Avoid unnecessary preprocessor directives: The preprocessor directives `#ifndef mehul` and `#ifdef mehul` are used to conditionally compile code based on the `mehul` macro. However, these directives are not used in the code and can be removed.

4. Optimize the loop to find the missing numbers: The code uses a loop to find the missing numbers in the `ans` vector. This loop has a time complexity of O(n^2) because it iterates over the `s1` set for each missing number. We can optimize this loop by using a set instead of a vector to store the missing numbers. This will reduce the time complexity to O(n) because set operations have an average time complexity of O(1).

5. Remove unnecessary comments and debug statements: The code includes several commented-out lines and debug statements that are not needed. We can remove these to improve code readability.

Here is the optimized code with the above optimizations:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <set>

int main() {
    std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    std::cin.tie(NULL);
    
    int n;
    std::cin >> n;
    
    std::vector<int> v(n);
    std::set<int> s1;
    
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        std::cin >> v[i];
        s1.insert(v[i]);
        if (v[i] > i + 1) {
            std::cout << -1 << '\n';
            return 0;
        }
    }
    
    std::vector<int> ans(n, -1);
    
    for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
        if (v[i - 1] != v[i]) {
            ans[i] = v[i - 1];
        }
    }
    
    int start = !v[0];
    
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (ans[i] == -1) {
            while (s1.find(start) != s1.end()) {
                start++;
            }
            ans[i] = start++;
        }
    }
    
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        std::cout << ans[i] << ' ';
    }
    
    return 0;
}
```

The optimized code is more readable and avoids unnecessary operations, resulting in improved performance.
