To optimize the given code, we can focus on the following aspects:

1. Unnecessary includes and typedefs: The code includes unnecessary headers (`<bits/stdc++.h>`, `<chrono>`) and typedefs. These should be removed to reduce compilation time and improve code readability.

2. Unordered sets and maps: The code uses unordered sets and maps (`umapii`, `umapib`, `umapsi`, `umapss`, `useti`) which can have performance overhead due to hash calculations. We can replace these with regular sets and maps to improve performance.

3. Redundant `exist` function: The `exist` function is unnecessary as it is not used in the code. We can safely remove it.

4. Unnecessary macros: The macros `debug`, `uset`, `it`, `INF`, `MOD`, `EPS`, `PI`, `sz`, `fr`, `rep`, `repr`, `frr`, `trav`, `fil`, `trace`, `end_routine` are not used in the code and can be removed.

5. Unnecessary `#ifdef` blocks: The `#ifdef mehul` blocks can be removed as they are not used in the code.

6. Unnecessary `freopen`: The `freopen("input.txt", "r", stdin);` statement can be removed as it is not used in the code.

7. Redundant initialization: The `ans` vector is initialized with `-1` which is not necessary as we are assigning values to it later in the code.

8. Unnecessary `ranges` vector: The `ranges` vector is not used in the code and can be removed.

9. Inefficient loop: The loop `while (s1.find(start) != s1.end())` can be optimized by using a `set` instead of a `vector` to check for the presence of an element. This will reduce the time complexity from O(n) to O(log n).

Based on these observations, here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <set>

using namespace std;

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);

  int n;
  cin >> n;
  vector<int> v(n);
  set<int> s1;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> v[i];
    s1.insert(v[i]);
    if (v[i] > i + 1) {
      cout << -1 << '\n';
      return 0;
    }
  }
  vector<int> ans(n);
  int start = !v[0];
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    if (v[i - 1] != v[i]) {
      ans[i] = v[i - 1];
    }
  }
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    if (ans[i] == 0) {
      while (s1.count(start) != 0) {
        start++;
      }
      ans[i] = start++;
    }
  }
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cout << ans[i] << ' ';
  }
  cout << endl;

  return 0;
}
```

This optimized code removes unnecessary includes, typedefs, macros, and `#ifdef` blocks. It replaces unordered sets with regular sets for better performance. It also optimizes the loop for checking the presence of an element.
