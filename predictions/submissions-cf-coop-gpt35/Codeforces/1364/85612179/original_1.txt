Code Analysis:
- The code includes unnecessary header files and typedefs that are not used in the program.
- The code includes debugging macros and functions that are not used in the program.
- The code uses some unnecessary macros like `INF`, `MOD`, `EPS`, `PI`.
- The code uses unnecessary `typedef` for unordered_map and map.
- The code includes a custom hash function that is not used in the program.
- The code uses unnecessary `chrono` library.
- The code uses a `set` to check if an element already exists in the vector, which can be done using a more efficient method.
- The code uses unnecessary loops and conditions to fill the `ans` vector.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Remove unnecessary header files and typedefs.
2. Remove unnecessary macros.
3. Remove the custom hash function.
4. Remove the `chrono` library.
5. Replace the use of `set` with a more efficient method to check if an element exists in the vector.
6. Simplify the logic to fill the `ans` vector.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Remove unnecessary header files and typedefs:
   - The `bits/stdc++.h` header file includes many unnecessary standard library headers. We can remove it and include only the necessary headers.
   - We can remove the `chrono` library as it is not used in the program.
   - We can remove the typedefs that are not used in the program.

2. Remove unnecessary macros:
   - We can remove the macros `INF`, `MOD`, `EPS`, `PI` as they are not used in the program.

3. Remove the custom hash function:
   - The custom hash function `custom_hash` is not used in the program. We can remove it.

4. Replace the use of `set` with a more efficient method:
   - The code uses a `set` to check if an element already exists in the vector. However, this can be done more efficiently using a boolean array of size `n+1`. We can initialize the array with `false`, and when we encounter an element `x`, we can set `arr[x] = true` to mark it as visited. Then, we can check if an element `x` exists in the vector by checking `arr[x]`.

5. Simplify the logic to fill the `ans` vector:
   - The code uses unnecessary loops and conditions to fill the `ans` vector. We can simplify this logic by iterating over the vector and filling the `ans` vector directly.

Optimized Code Block:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);

  int n;
  cin >> n;
  
  vector<int> v(n);
  vector<int> ans(n, -1);
  vector<bool> visited(n+1, false);

  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> v[i];
    if (v[i] > i + 1) {
      cout << -1 << '\n';
      return 0;
    }
    visited[v[i]] = true;
  }

  int start = 1;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    if (ans[i] == -1) {
      while (visited[start]) {
        start++;
      }
      ans[i] = start++;
    }
  }

  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cout << ans[i] << ' ';
  }

  return 0;
}
```

The optimized code maintains the functionality and output of the original code while improving performance by removing unnecessary code and using more efficient data structures and logic.
