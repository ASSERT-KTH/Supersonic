The given code seems to be solving a problem that involves calculating the length of the longest subarray whose sum is not divisible by a given number. Here are some potential optimizations that can be applied to the code:

1. Remove unnecessary header files: The code includes the entire `bits/stdc++.h` header, which is not recommended. Instead, include only the necessary headers like `<iostream>`, `<vector>`, and `<algorithm>`.

2. Use `constexpr` instead of `#define` for constants: Instead of using `#define` for constants like `ll` and `pb`, use `constexpr` to define them. This will allow the compiler to evaluate the constant at compile-time, resulting in potential performance improvements.

3. Avoid `using namespace std`: It is generally considered a good practice to avoid using the `using namespace std` directive, as it can lead to naming conflicts and make the code less readable. Instead, use the `std::` prefix when necessary.

4. Avoid unnecessary calculations and iterations:
   - The loop `fon sum += a[i];` can be replaced with `int sum = accumulate(a.begin(), a.end(), 0);`. This will calculate the sum of all elements in the vector `a` in a single operation, rather than iterating through the loop.
   - The loop `for (i = 0; i < n; i++) if (a[i]) break;` can be replaced with `int pos = find_if(a.begin(), a.end(), [](int val) { return val != 0; }) - a.begin() + 1;`. This will find the first non-zero element in the vector `a` and calculate its position in a more concise way.
   - Similarly, the loop `for (i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) if (a[i]) break;` can be replaced with `int pos = n - (find_if(a.rbegin(), a.rend(), [](int val) { return val != 0; }) - a.rbegin());`. This will find the last non-zero element in the vector `a` and calculate its position from the end of the vector.

5. Optimize the loop that calculates the final result: The loop `cout << n - pos << endl;` can be replaced with `cout << max(n - pos, 0) << endl;`. This will ensure that the result is always non-negative, even if `pos` exceeds `n`.

Here's the optimized code with the proposed changes:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <numeric>

int main() {
  std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  int t;
  std::cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    int n, x;
    std::cin >> n >> x;
    std::vector<int> a(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      std::cin >> a[i];
      a[i] %= x;
    }
    int sum = std::accumulate(a.begin(), a.end(), 0);
    if (sum % x != 0) {
      std::cout << n << std::endl;
      continue;
    }
    int pos = std::min(
      std::find_if(a.begin(), a.end(), [](int val) { return val != 0; }) - a.begin() + 1,
      n - (std::find_if(a.rbegin(), a.rend(), [](int val) { return val != 0; }) - a.rbegin())
    );
    std::cout << std::max(n - pos, 0) << std::endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```

By applying these optimizations, the code should run more efficiently and consume less memory.
