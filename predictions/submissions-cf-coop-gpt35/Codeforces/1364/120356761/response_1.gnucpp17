The given code calculates the length of the longest subarray whose sum is not divisible by a given number 'x'. However, the code can be optimized to improve its efficiency. Here is the step-by-step optimization strategy:

1. Remove unnecessary headers: The line `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` includes all the standard library headers, which is not recommended. We can remove this line and include only the necessary headers, such as `<iostream>` and `<vector>`.

2. Avoid using `using namespace std`: It is not recommended to use the entire `std` namespace. Instead, use the `std::` prefix before the standard library functions and types.

3. Remove unnecessary macros: The macros `ll`, `pb`, and `fon` are not being used in the code. We can remove them to simplify the code.

4. Minimize the number of variable declarations: Declare variables as close as possible to their usage. For example, the variables `i`, `j`, `k`, and `answer` are declared at the beginning of the `main()` function but are not used until later in the code. We can declare them at their respective usage points.

5. Optimize the calculation of the sum: Instead of separately calculating the sum of the elements in the array, we can calculate it while reading the input. This eliminates the need for the loop to calculate the sum.

6. Optimize the search for the leftmost and rightmost non-zero elements: The current implementation uses two separate loops to find the leftmost and rightmost non-zero elements. We can combine these loops into a single loop to find both the leftmost and rightmost non-zero elements in a single pass.

7. Use more efficient data structures: The code currently uses a vector to store the input array. However, since the size of the array is fixed, we can use a regular C-style array instead to save memory.

8. Eliminate unnecessary checks: The code checks if `sum % x` is non-zero before calculating the leftmost and rightmost non-zero elements. However, this check is unnecessary because if `sum % x` is zero, then the answer will be `n`.

9. Consider compiler optimizations: We can use compiler optimizations to further improve the performance of the code. For example, we can enable compiler optimizations using pragmas or command-line options.
