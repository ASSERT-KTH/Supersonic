Code Analysis:
1. The code includes unnecessary header files, such as `<bits/stdc++.h>`, `<cstdio>`, and `<string>`. These headers are not used in the code and can be removed.
2. There are several unnecessary `#define` statements, such as `pii`, `In`, `NO`, `m1`, `No`, `YES`, `Yes`, `pb`, `bug`, `all`, and `sz`. These can be removed.
3. The code contains global variables that are not used or initialized, such as `ev`, `od`, `tt`, `vis`, `edge`, `l`, `c2`, and `chid`. These variables can be removed.
4. The `dfs` function is not used in the code and can be removed.
5. The code includes unnecessary vector `aa` and vector array `vec`. These can be removed.
6. The code initializes and uses multiple variables with the same name, such as `n` and `m`. This can lead to confusion and should be avoided.
7. The code has unnecessary sorting of vectors, which is not required for the output.
8. The code prints unnecessary debug output, such as the size of vector `v`.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Remove unnecessary header files and `#define` statements.
2. Remove unused global variables.
3. Remove unused function `dfs`.
4. Remove unnecessary vectors `aa` and vector array `vec`.
5. Remove unnecessary sorting of vectors.
6. Remove unnecessary debug output.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Remove unnecessary header files and `#define` statements:
   - The header files `<bits/stdc++.h>`, `<cstdio>`, and `<string>` are not used in the code and can be removed.
   - The `#define` statements `pii`, `In`, `NO`, `m1`, `No`, `YES`, `Yes`, `pb`, `bug`, `all`, and `sz` are not used in the code and can be removed.

2. Remove unused global variables:
   - Remove the global variables `ev`, `od`, `tt`, `vis`, `edge`, `l`, `c2`, and `chid` as they are not used or initialized.

3. Remove unused function `dfs`:
   - The function `dfs` is not used in the code and can be removed.

4. Remove unnecessary vectors `aa` and vector array `vec`:
   - Remove the vector `aa` as it is not used in the code.
   - Remove the vector array `vec` as it is not used in the code.

5. Remove unnecessary sorting of vectors:
   - Remove the sorting of vector `v` as it is not required for the output.

6. Remove unnecessary debug output:
   - Remove the debug output that prints the size of vector `v`.
