The given code appears to be a C++ program that takes input values from a file and performs some calculations on the input data. However, the code includes a number of unnecessary includes, preprocessor directives, and redundant code snippets. Therefore, the optimization strategy will focus on the following areas:

1. Removing unnecessary includes and preprocessor directives.
2. Eliminating redundant computations and variables.
3. Improving memory allocation and usage.
4. Optimizing loops and recursive calls.
