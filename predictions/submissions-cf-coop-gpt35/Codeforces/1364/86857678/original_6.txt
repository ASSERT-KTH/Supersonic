Code Analysis:
- The code includes unnecessary header files and macros that are not being used.
- The code includes multiple unnecessary print statements (cout statements) that are not required for the final output.
- The code contains redundant variable declarations, such as `m` and `pos` which are not used.
- The code includes unnecessary vector `v2`, which is not used in the final output.
- The code uses an inefficient approach to find the elements where the sequence `a` changes from increasing to decreasing or vice versa. This can be done in a more optimized way.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Remove unnecessary header files and macros.
2. Remove unnecessary print statements.
3. Remove redundant variable declarations.
4. Optimize the approach to find the elements where the sequence `a` changes from increasing to decreasing or vice versa.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Remove unnecessary header files and macros:
   - Remove the following unnecessary header files:
     ```
     #include <bits/stdc++.h>
     #include <cstdio>
     #include <string>
     ```
   - Remove the following unnecessary macros:
     ```
     #define pii pair<ll, ll>
     #define In freopen("ahsan.txt", "r", stdin);
     #define NO cout << "NO" << endl
     #define m1 cout << "-1" << endl
     #define No cout << "No" << endl
     #define YES cout << "YES" << endl
     #define Yes cout << "Yes" << endl
     #define pb push_back
     #define bug(a) cerr << #a << " : " << a << endl
     #define all(v) (v.begin(), v.end())
     #define sz(x) x.size()
     ```

2. Remove unnecessary print statements:
   - Remove the following unnecessary print statements:
     ```
     cout << v.size() << endl;
     for (auto it : v)
       cout << it << " ";
     cout << endl;
     ```

3. Remove redundant variable declarations:
   - Remove the following redundant variable declarations:
     ```
     ll mx = 1, mn = 1, x = -1;
     ```

4. Optimize the approach to find the elements where the sequence `a` changes from increasing to decreasing or vice versa:
   - Replace the existing approach to find the elements where the sequence `a` changes from increasing to decreasing or vice versa with an optimized approach.
   - The optimized approach can be implemented by iterating over the array `a` and checking if the current element is different from the previous element. If it is different, add it to the `v` vector.
   - This approach avoids the need to check for the first and last elements separately, as well as the need to check the condition for each element.
