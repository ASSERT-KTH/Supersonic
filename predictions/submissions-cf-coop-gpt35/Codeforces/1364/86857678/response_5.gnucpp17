Code Analysis:
1. The code includes unnecessary header files that are not used in the program.
2. There are multiple macro definitions that are not used in the code, such as `pii`, `In`, `NO`, `m1`, `No`, `YES`, `Yes`.
3. The code uses a mix of C and C++ syntax, which can be simplified and made consistent.
4. There are redundant variables and arrays, such as `ev`, `od`, `tt`, `l`, `c2`, `ok`.
5. The code uses a vector of vectors (`vec`) to represent a graph, which can be replaced with a more efficient data structure.
6. The code uses recursion for depth-first search (DFS), which can be optimized using an iterative approach.
7. There are unnecessary vector copies and iterations, which can be avoided to improve performance.
8. The code does not utilize any compiler optimizations.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Remove unnecessary header files and macro definitions.
2. Simplify and make the code consistent by removing unused variables and arrays, and fixing the syntax.
3. Replace the vector of vectors (`vec`) with a more efficient data structure, such as an adjacency list.
4. Optimize the DFS function by using an iterative approach instead of recursion.
5. Avoid unnecessary vector copies and iterations.
6. Utilize compiler optimizations to further improve performance.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Remove unnecessary header files and macro definitions:
   - The code includes unnecessary header files `<bits/stdc++.h>` and `<string>`. Remove them.
   - Remove the unused macro definitions `pii`, `In`, `NO`, `m1`, `No`, `YES`, `Yes`.

2. Simplify and make the code consistent:
   - Remove the unused variables `ev`, `od`, `tt`, `l`, `c2`, `ok`.
   - Remove the unused array `chid`.
   - Fix the inconsistent indentation and spacing.
   - Replace the `endl` with `"\n"` for better performance.

3. Replace the vector of vectors (`vec`) with an adjacency list:
   - Replace the declaration `vector<int> vec[mx]` with `vector<int> vec[mx];`.
   - Instead of using `vec[s].push_back(u)` to add an edge between vertices `s` and `u`, use `vec[s].emplace_back(u)` for better performance.
   - Replace the loop `for (int i = 0; i < vec[s].size(); i++)` with a range-based loop `for (int u : vec[s])` for better readability and performance.

4. Optimize the DFS function:
   - Replace the recursive DFS function with an iterative approach using a stack.
   - Create a stack and push the starting vertex onto it.
   - While the stack is not empty, pop a vertex from the stack and mark it as visited.
   - Iterate through the adjacent vertices of the popped vertex and push any unvisited vertices onto the stack.
   - If the destination vertex is found, set the `ok` flag to true and break the loop.
   - This iterative approach avoids the overhead of function calls and stack operations.

5. Avoid unnecessary vector copies and iterations:
   - Instead of creating a new vector `v` and copying elements from `a` to `v`, iterate through `a` directly.
   - Use a flag to keep track of whether the previous element was smaller or larger, and push the current element to a new vector `v` only if it is different from the previous element.
   - This avoids the need for a separate loop to print the elements of `v` and reduces memory usage.

6. Utilize compiler optimizations:
   - Use compiler optimizations to further improve performance. Enable optimizations such as `-O2` or `-O3` to allow the compiler to apply various optimization techniques, such as loop unrolling, inlining, and common subexpression elimination.
