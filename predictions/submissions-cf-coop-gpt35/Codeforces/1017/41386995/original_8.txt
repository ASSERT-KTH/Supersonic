The provided code seems to be calculating the sum of the function `f(i)` for values of `i` from 2 to `n`. The function `f(i)` is a cubic polynomial, and the sum is calculated by iterating over the values of `i` and multiplying `f(i)` by the number of times `i` divides `n`.

However, the code contains several areas that can be optimized for better performance:

1. The `read()` function uses `getchar()` to read characters one by one and convert them to integers. This can be slow and inefficient. A better approach would be to use `scanf()` or `cin` to read integers directly.

2. The function `qwq()` is called to calculate a specific formula for a given value of `x`. This function can be simplified and made more efficient.

3. The code uses an array `P` to store prime numbers, but it doesn't seem to be used effectively. A better approach would be to use a more efficient prime number generation algorithm, such as the Sieve of Eratosthenes, to generate primes up to `n` directly.

4. The code uses an array `p` to store a bitmap of numbers that have been checked for primality. This bitmap could be optimized to use a more compact data structure, such as a bitset or a boolean array.

5. There are several unnecessary calculations and checks in the code that can be removed to improve performance.

Based on these observations, the following step-by-step optimization strategy can be proposed:

Step 1: Replace the `read()` function with `scanf()` or `cin` for faster input reading.

Step 2: Simplify the `qwq()` function to remove unnecessary calculations.

Step 3: Use the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to generate prime numbers up to `n` and store them in a vector.

Step 4: Use a bitset or a boolean array instead of the `p` array to store the primality bitmap.

Step 5: Simplify the main calculation loop by removing unnecessary checks and calculations.

Now, let's implement these optimizations in the code:
