Code Analysis:

1. The code reads a positive integer `n` and four coefficients `A`, `B`, `C`, and `D` from the input.
2. It then calculates the value of `ans` by iterating over all numbers from 2 to `n` and updating `ans` based on some conditions.
3. The function `f(x)` calculates a polynomial expression using the coefficients `A`, `B`, `C`, and `D`.
4. The function `qwq(x)` calculates a formula using `x` and some arithmetic operations.
5. The code uses an array `p` to store a bitmap representation of numbers that are not prime.

Potential Optimizations:

1. The `read()` function can be optimized to read the input more efficiently. Currently, it reads one character at a time and checks if it is a digit. This can be slow for large inputs. It can be improved using a more efficient method like `scanf()` or `cin`.
2. The `f(x)` function can be optimized by using a more efficient method to calculate the polynomial expression. Currently, it uses multiple multiplication operations, which can be time-consuming for large values of `x`.
3. The `qwq(x)` function can be optimized by using a more efficient formula or method to calculate the result. The current formula involves multiple arithmetic operations, which can be simplified or optimized.
4. The code uses a bitmap representation to store non-prime numbers in the array `p`. This can be improved by using a more efficient data structure to store and check for non-prime numbers.
5. The loops in the code can be optimized by using loop unrolling, loop fusion, or loop interchange techniques to reduce loop overhead and improve cache utilization.
6. Compiler optimizations and pragmas can be used to guide the compiler to optimize certain parts of the code, such as loop unrolling, vectorization, or parallelization.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Replace the `read()` function with a more efficient input reading method like `scanf()` or `cin`.
2. Optimize the `f(x)` function by using a more efficient method to calculate the polynomial expression.
3. Optimize the `qwq(x)` function by simplifying or optimizing the formula.
4. Replace the bitmap representation in the array `p` with a more efficient data structure to store and check for non-prime numbers.
5. Apply loop optimizations like loop unrolling, loop fusion, or loop interchange to reduce loop overhead and improve cache utilization.
6. Use compiler optimizations and pragmas to guide the compiler to optimize certain parts of the code.

Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. Optimization 1: Replace the `read()` function with a more efficient input reading method like `scanf()` or `cin` to improve input reading performance. This will reduce the time spent on reading the input.

2. Optimization 2: Optimize the `f(x)` function by using a more efficient method to calculate the polynomial expression. Currently, it uses multiple multiplication operations. We can optimize this by using Horner's method, which reduces the number of multiplications. The optimized `f(x)` function would be:

```c++
unsigned int f(unsigned int x) {
  return (((A * x + B) * x + C) * x + D);
}
```

This reduces the number of multiplications from 3 to 2.

3. Optimization 3: Optimize the `qwq(x)` function by simplifying or optimizing the formula. The current formula involves multiple arithmetic operations. We can optimize this by using a simplified formula. After simplification, the optimized `qwq(x)` function would be:

```c++
unsigned int qwq(int x) {
  return (unsigned int)(x - x / 2 - x / 3 - x / 5 + x / 6 + x / 10 + x / 15 - x / 30);
}
```

This simplifies the formula and reduces the number of arithmetic operations.

4. Optimization 4: Replace the bitmap representation in the array `p` with a more efficient data structure to store and check for non-prime numbers. One possible optimization is to use the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to generate a list of prime numbers up to `n` and then use this list to check for non-prime numbers. This would eliminate the need for the bitmap representation and improve the efficiency of the prime number checking.

5. Optimization 5: Apply loop optimizations like loop unrolling, loop fusion, or loop interchange to reduce loop overhead and improve cache utilization. This can be done by analyzing the loops in the code and identifying opportunities for optimizing the loop structure.

6. Optimization 6: Use compiler optimizations and pragmas to guide the compiler to optimize certain parts of the code. This can be done by adding appropriate compiler optimizations flags or pragma directives to suggest optimizations like loop unrolling, vectorization, or parallelization.

      F1 = f(i);
      while (j <= n) {

        if ((long long)j * i > n)

  cout << ans;

  return 0;

Note: The code has been optimized based on the proposed optimizations. However, it is important to note that the actual performance gain may vary depending on the specific input and system configuration. It is recommended to perform further testing and profiling to evaluate the effectiveness of the optimizations.
