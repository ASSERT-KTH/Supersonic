Code Analysis:
1. The code uses the `bits/stdc++.h` header, which includes all the standard C++ libraries. This can lead to slower compile times and increased memory usage.
2. The `read()` function is used to read integers from the input. It uses `getchar()` to read characters one by one and convert them to integers. This can be slow and inefficient, especially for large inputs.
3. The `f()` function calculates a polynomial expression. It is called multiple times in the code, which can result in redundant computations.
4. The `qwq()` function calculates a formula involving integer divisions. It is called multiple times in the code and can be optimized.
5. The code uses a sieve-like approach to find prime numbers and perform some calculations based on them. However, the implementation can be improved for better performance.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Replace the `bits/stdc++.h` header with specific headers that are actually required by the code. This can reduce compile times and memory usage.
2. Modify the `read()` function to use a more efficient method for reading integers from the input. One possible approach is to use the `scanf()` function, which is faster than `getchar()`.
3. Avoid redundant computations of the `f()` function. Calculate the polynomial expression once and store the result in a variable, instead of recalculating it multiple times.
4. Optimize the `qwq()` function by eliminating the division operations. This can be done by precomputing the values of the formula for a given range of input values and storing them in an array.
5. Improve the prime number generation and calculation logic. Use a more efficient algorithm, such as the Sieve of Eratosthenes, to find prime numbers and perform the required calculations. This can reduce the number of iterations and improve overall performance.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Replace the `bits/stdc++.h` header with specific headers that are actually required by the code. In this case, the code uses `iostream`, `cstdlib`, `cmath`, and `cstring`. Replace `bits/stdc++.h` with these headers to reduce compile times and memory usage.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <cmath>
#include <cstring>
```

2. Modify the `read()` function to use a more efficient method for reading integers from the input. Replace the `read()` function with the `scanf()` function to read integers directly from the input. This is faster than using `getchar()`.

```cpp
inline int read() {
  int k;
  scanf("%d", &k);
  return k;
}
```

3. Avoid redundant computations of the `f()` function. Calculate the polynomial expression once and store the result in a variable, instead of recalculating it multiple times. Modify the code to calculate `F1` only once and reuse it in the loop.

```cpp
unsigned int F1 = f(i);
```

4. Optimize the `qwq()` function by eliminating the division operations. Precompute the values of the formula for a given range of input values and store them in an array. Replace the `qwq()` function with an array `qwq[]` that contains the precomputed values.

```cpp
unsigned int qwq[] = {0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 5, 6, 6, 6, 7, 8, 8, 9, 9, 10, 10, 10, 11, 12, 12, 13, 13, 14, 14, 14, 15, 16, 16, 17, 17, 18, 18, 18, 19, 20, 20, 21, 21, 22, 22, 22, 23, 24, 24, 25, 25, 26, 26, 26, 27, 28, 28, 29, 29, 30, 30, 30};
```

5. Improve the prime number generation and calculation logic. Use the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to find prime numbers and perform the required calculations. This can be done as follows:

```cpp
const int MAX_N = 2500000 + 2;
bool is_prime[MAX_N];
unsigned int P[MAX_N], l = 0;

void sieve() {
  memset(is_prime, true, sizeof(is_prime));
  is_prime[0] = is_prime[1] = false;

  for (int i = 2; i < MAX_N; i++) {
    if (is_prime[i]) {
      P[++l] = i;
      for (int j = i + i; j < MAX_N; j += i) {
        is_prime[j] = false;
      }
    }
  }
}
```

6. Replace the loop that starts with `for (; i <= n; i++)` with a loop that iterates over the prime numbers found using the Sieve of Eratosthenes. This will reduce the number of iterations and improve performance.

```cpp
for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
  if (is_prime[i]) {
    unsigned int j = i;
    unsigned int F1 = f(i);
    while (j <= n) {
      ans += (n / j) * F1;
      if ((ll)j * i > n)
        break;
      j *= i;
    }
  }
}
```

  return A * x * x * x + B * x * x + C * x + D;
}

const int MAX_N = 2500000 + 2;

      l--;
    for (j = 1; j <= l && (ll)P[j] * i <= n; j++) {
      x = P[j] * i;
      if ((x & 1) && x % 3 != 0 && x % 5 != 0) {
        x = qwq[x];
        p[x >> 5] |= (unsigned int)1 << (x & xx);
      }
      if (i % P[j] == 0)
        break;
    }
  }
  for (; i <= n; i++) {
    if (is_prime[i] || ((i & 1) && i % 3 != 0 && i % 5 != 0 && !(p[(x = qwq[i]) >> 5] & ((unsigned int)1 << (x & xx))))) {
      j = i;

This optimized code should have improved performance and reduced memory usage compared to the original code. However, it is always recommended to profile the code and measure the performance improvements to validate the optimizations.
