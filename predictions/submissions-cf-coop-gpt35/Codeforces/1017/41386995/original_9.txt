The given code calculates the sum of values of the function f(x) for all x from 2 to n, where f(x) is a polynomial function. The code uses a combination of prime sieving and factorization techniques to optimize the calculation process.

Upon analyzing the code, we can identify several areas that can be optimized for better performance:

1. Input Reading: The current implementation reads input values character by character using the `getchar()` function. This can be slow, especially for large inputs. We can improve the input reading process by using a more efficient input function, such as `scanf()`.

2. Unnecessary Variable Declarations: The code declares several unnecessary variables, such as `F`, `P`, and `l`, which are not used in the computation. Removing these declarations can improve both memory usage and code readability.

3. Redundant Function Calls: The function `qwq()` is called multiple times with the same argument value. We can optimize this by storing the result of the function call in a variable and reusing it where needed.

4. Bitwise Operations: The code uses bitwise operations to calculate index and bit positions in the `p` array. Instead of using bitwise operators, we can use division and modulo operations, which are generally faster and more efficient.

5. Loop Optimization: The code contains two nested loops that iterate over a range of values. We can optimize these loops by applying loop unrolling techniques to reduce loop overhead and improve cache utilization.

6. Compiler Optimizations: We can suggest the use of compiler-specific optimization flags or pragma directives to hint the compiler to optimize certain parts of the code. This can include enabling loop unrolling, inline function expansion, and vectorization.

Now, let's optimize the code step by step.
