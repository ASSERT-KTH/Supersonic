The provided code calculates the sum of a function `f(x)` for all values of `x` from 1 to `n`. The function `f(x)` is defined as `A * x * x * x + B * x * x + C * x + D`. The code also uses a sieve-like approach to filter out prime numbers.

Upon analyzing the code, we can identify several areas that can be optimized:

1. Input Reading:
   - The `read()` function is used to read integers from input. However, this function is not efficient and can be replaced with standard input reading functions like `scanf()` or `cin`.

2. Sieve Implementation:
   - The code uses an array `p` to store a sieve-like filter for prime numbers. However, this implementation is not efficient and can be replaced with a more optimized algorithm like the Sieve of Eratosthenes.

3. Loop Optimization:
   - The code uses two separate loops to calculate the sum of `f(x)` for different ranges of values. These two loops can be combined into a single loop to improve performance.

4. Redundant Computations:
   - Some computations are performed multiple times within the loops. These redundant computations can be eliminated by storing the computed values in variables.

5. Compiler Optimizations:
   - Compiler optimizations, such as loop unrolling, can be used to improve the performance of the code.
