The provided code reads a number `t` from input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads a number `n`, followed by `n` integers. The code then inserts these `n` integers into a set data structure and prints the size of the set.

Upon analyzing the code, we can identify a few areas for optimization:

1. Using `bits/stdc++.h` header: This header includes all the standard library headers, which can slow down the compilation process. It is recommended to include only the necessary headers.

2. Using `set` data structure: Although `set` provides automatic sorting and uniqueness, it has a higher memory overhead compared to other data structures. In this case, since we are only interested in the number of unique elements, we can use a more memory-efficient alternative.

3. Using `ll` as a type alias for `long long`: While it is good practice to use a type alias for `long long`, the use of `bits/stdc++.h` is not recommended. It is better to include the `<cstdint>` header and use the `int64_t` type instead.

4. Using `endl` instead of `'\n'`: The `endl` manipulator not only inserts a newline character but also flushes the output buffer. This can significantly impact performance, especially when used in a loop. It is more efficient to use `'\n'` to insert a newline character without flushing the buffer.

Based on these observations, we can propose the following optimization steps:

Step 1: Replace the `bits/stdc++.h` header with the necessary standard library headers.

Step 2: Replace the `set` data structure with a more memory-efficient alternative.

Step 3: Replace the `ll` type alias with `int64_t` and include the `<cstdint>` header.

Step 4: Replace `endl` with `'\n'` to improve performance.
