The given code reads a number `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads a number `n` followed by `n` integers. It then inserts these integers into a set and prints the size of the set.

Let's analyze the code to identify potential areas for optimization:

1. The `bits/stdc++.h` header file includes a lot of unnecessary standard library headers, which can slow down the compilation process. We should only include the necessary headers.

2. The `set` data structure is used to store the input integers and remove duplicates. However, using a `set` comes with a significant performance cost, especially when inserting elements. We should consider using a more efficient data structure to store the integers.

3. The input integers are being inserted into the set one by one in a loop. This can be a bottleneck if there are a large number of input integers. We should try to optimize this loop.

4. The `size()` function is called on the set to get the number of unique elements. While this is a constant-time operation for a set, we can avoid the function call and directly access the size of the set.

Based on these observations, here is an optimization strategy:

1. Remove the unnecessary `bits/stdc++.h` include statement and include only the necessary headers (`iostream` and `unordered_set`).

2. Replace the `set` with an `unordered_set`, which provides constant-time average insertion and search operations. This will eliminate the performance overhead of using a `set`.

3. Instead of inserting the input integers one by one in a loop, read all the integers into a vector and then insert the vector into the `unordered_set` using the range constructor. This will reduce the number of insert operations from `n` to 1.

4. Update the code to directly print the size of the `unordered_set` instead of calling the `size()` function.

Now let's implement these optimizations step by step:
