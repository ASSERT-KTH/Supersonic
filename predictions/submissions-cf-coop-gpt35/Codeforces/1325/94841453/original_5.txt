The given code reads a number `t` as input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads a number `n`, followed by `n` integers. It then inserts these integers into a set and prints the size of the set.

Let's analyze the code to identify potential areas for optimization:

1. The `bits/stdc++.h` header is included, which is not a standard C++ header. It includes many unnecessary headers and can slow down the compilation process. It's better to include only the necessary headers explicitly.

2. The code uses a `set` to store the unique integers and then prints the size of the set. While this ensures that only unique elements are stored, it has a performance cost. The insertion operation has a time complexity of O(log n), and finding the size of the set also has a time complexity of O(log n). We can optimize this by using a `unordered_set` instead, which has an average constant time complexity for insertion and finding the size.

3. The code uses a `while` loop to read the integers and insert them into the set. Instead, we can use a `for` loop with a predefined iteration count `n`. This will avoid the need to decrement `n` in each iteration.

4. The code uses a `while` loop to iterate over the test cases. We can optimize this by using a `for` loop with a predefined iteration count `t`.

Based on these observations, let's proceed with the optimization strategy.
