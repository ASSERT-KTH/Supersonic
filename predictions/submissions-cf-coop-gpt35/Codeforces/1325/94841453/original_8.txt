The provided code reads an integer `t` as the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` followed by `n` integers and inserts them into a set. Finally, it prints the size of the set.

To optimize this code, we can make the following improvements:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The line `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` is a non-standard include that includes all standard library headers. It is not recommended to use this in production code. Instead, we should include only the necessary headers like `<iostream>` and `<set>`.

2. Avoid unnecessary data type: The type `ll` is defined as `long long`. However, `long long` is not necessary for the number of test cases or the size of the set. We can replace `ll` with `int` for these variables.

3. Optimize input and output: The code uses `cin` and `cout` for input and output. These functions are slower compared to `scanf` and `printf`. We can replace the input and output statements with `scanf` and `printf` for better performance.

4. Optimize set insertion: The code uses a set to store the unique elements. However, a set has an overhead in terms of memory and time complexity. We can replace the set with an unordered_set, which has a similar interface but provides faster insertion and lookup.

Taking these optimizations into account, here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_set>

int main() {
  int t;
  scanf("%d", &t);
  
  while (t--) {
    int n, x;
    scanf("%d", &n);
    
    std::unordered_set<int> uniqueElements;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      scanf("%d", &x);
      uniqueElements.insert(x);
    }
    
    printf("%lu\n", uniqueElements.size());
  }
  
  return 0;
}
```

In this optimized code, we have replaced unnecessary includes, removed unnecessary data types, optimized input and output, and replaced the set with an unordered_set. These optimizations improve the performance by reducing memory usage and using more efficient data structures.
