The given code reads a number `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads a number `n` followed by `n` integers. It then inserts these integers into a set and prints the size of the set.

To optimize this code, we can focus on two main areas:
1. Avoid unnecessary memory allocations and deallocations.
2. Reduce the number of input/output operations.

Let's discuss the optimizations step by step.

Step 1: Avoid unnecessary memory allocations and deallocations
- The code currently creates a new set `a` for each test case. Instead, we can reuse the same set for all test cases to avoid the overhead of memory allocations and deallocations.
- We can move the set `a` outside the while loop and clear it at the beginning of each iteration.

Step 2: Reduce the number of input/output operations
- The code currently uses `cin` and `cout` for each input and output operation, which can be slow due to frequent system calls. Instead, we can use `scanf` and `printf` for faster input/output operations.
- We can replace the `cin` and `cout` statements with `scanf` and `printf` respectively.

With these optimizations in mind, let's rewrite the code.
