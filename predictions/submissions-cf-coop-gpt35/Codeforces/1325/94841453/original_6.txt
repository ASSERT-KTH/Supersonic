The given code reads a number `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads a number `n` followed by `n` integers and inserts them into a set. Finally, it outputs the size of the set.

Upon analyzing the code, we can identify a few potential areas for optimization:

1. The use of `bits/stdc++.h` header: This header includes all other standard C++ headers, which can lead to slower compilation times and increased memory usage. It is better to include only the necessary headers.

2. The use of `set`: While using a set ensures uniqueness of elements, it has a higher memory overhead compared to other data structures. We can potentially use an unordered set (`unordered_set`) instead, which trades off some memory for faster insertion and lookup operations.

3. The repeated use of `cin` and `cout`: The use of `cin` and `cout` for each input and output operation can slow down the program. We can potentially optimize this by using `scanf` and `printf` functions, which are faster for input and output.

4. The unnecessary use of `ll` macro: The `ll` macro is used to define `long long` type. However, it is not necessary to use a macro for this purpose. We can directly use the `long long` type in the code.

Based on these observations, we can propose the following optimization strategy:

1. Replace the `bits/stdc++.h` header with the necessary headers (`iostream`, `unordered_set`, and `cstdio`).

2. Replace the `set<ll>` with `unordered_set<ll>` to reduce memory usage.

3. Replace the `cin` and `cout` operations with `scanf` and `printf` respectively, for faster input and output.

Let's now implement these optimizations step by step:
