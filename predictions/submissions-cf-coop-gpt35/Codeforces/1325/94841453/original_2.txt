The provided code reads an integer `t` as the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads an integer `n` followed by `n` integers. It then inserts the `n` integers into a set data structure and prints the size of the set.

To optimize this code, we can make the following improvements:

1. Remove unnecessary header files: The `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` directive includes all standard library headers, which is unnecessary and can slow down the compilation process. We can replace it with the specific headers used in the code, which are `<iostream>` and `<set>`.

2. Replace `set` with `unordered_set`: The `set` data structure stores elements in a sorted order, which requires additional time for sorting and maintaining the sorted property. We can replace it with the `unordered_set` data structure, which does not maintain any particular order and provides faster average insertion and lookup time.

3. Avoid unnecessary memory allocation: The code currently creates a new `set` or `unordered_set` for each test case. Instead, we can create a single `unordered_set` outside the loop and clear it before each test case.

4. Replace `while` loop with a `for` loop: The `while` loop used to read `n` integers can be replaced with a `for` loop that loops from `0` to `n-1`. This change can make the code more readable.

5. Use `reserve` to optimize memory usage: The `unordered_set` data structure may allocate more memory than necessary to reduce collisions. We can use the `reserve` method to allocate memory upfront based on the expected number of elements. In this case, we can reserve `n` elements.

Here's the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_set>

int main() {
  int t;
  std::cin >> t;

  std::unordered_set<int> elements;
  for (int i = 0; i < t; i++) {
    int n;
    std::cin >> n;

    elements.clear();
    elements.reserve(n);

    for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
      int x;
      std::cin >> x;
      elements.insert(x);
    }

    std::cout << elements.size() << std::endl;
  }

  return 0;
}
```

With these optimizations, the code should run more efficiently, especially for large test cases, and use memory more sparingly.
