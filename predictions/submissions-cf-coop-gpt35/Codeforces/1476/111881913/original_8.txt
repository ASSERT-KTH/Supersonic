The given code appears to calculate a value based on the input data. However, there are several areas that can be optimized to improve the performance and memory usage.

1. Avoid unnecessary includes: The line `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` includes the entire C++ standard library, which is unnecessary and can slow down the compilation time. Instead, include only the necessary headers such as `<iostream>` and `<vector>`.

2. Use `int` instead of `unsigned long long int` for loop variables: The loop variables `i` and `t` are only used as loop counters and do not require the larger data type `unsigned long long int`. Using `int` instead can save memory.

3. Use `reserve` for vector: The vector `v` is resized dynamically as elements are added. Since the number of elements is known in advance, you can use the `reserve` function to allocate memory for the vector upfront. This avoids the overhead of resizing the vector multiple times.

4. Avoid unnecessary arithmetic operations: In the inner loop, the same division operation `(x / k)` is performed twice. Instead, calculate the result once and reuse it.

5. Use integer division instead of floating-point division: The expression `(v[i] * 100) > sum * k` involves floating-point multiplication and comparison. Since the variables `v[i]`, `sum`, and `k` are integers, it is more efficient to perform integer multiplication and comparison. This can be done by multiplying both sides of the comparison by `100`.

6. Simplify the code logic: The code can be simplified by removing the unnecessary `else` branch in the `if` statement and combining the two branches into one. This eliminates the duplicated code and improves readability.

7. Optimize the loop iteration: The loop iterates from `i = 1` to `n - 1` and accesses `v[i]` and `v[i-1]`. This introduces a dependency between iterations, which can limit the effectiveness of loop unrolling. To improve performance, the loop can be modified to start from `i = 0` and access `v[i]` and `v[i+1]`. This eliminates the dependency between iterations and allows for better instruction pipelining.

With these optimizations in mind, here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

int main() {
  int t;
  std::cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    int n, k;
    std::cin >> n >> k;
    std::vector<int> v(n);
    v.reserve(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      std::cin >> v[i];
    }
    int ans = 0;
    int sum = v[0];
    for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
      int x = v[i + 1] * 100 - sum * k;
      if (x > 0) {
        ans += (x + k - 1) / k;
        sum += (x + k - 1) / k;
      }
      sum += v[i + 1];
    }
    std::cout << ans << std::endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```

These optimizations aim to improve the performance and memory usage of the original code while preserving its functionality and output.
