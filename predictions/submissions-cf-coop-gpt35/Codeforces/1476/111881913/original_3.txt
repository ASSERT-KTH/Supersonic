Code Analysis:
- The code reads an integer `t` as the number of test cases.
- For each test case, the code reads two integers `n` and `k` followed by an array of `n` integers.
- The code calculates the number of additional elements needed to make the sum of the array elements at least `k` times the running sum of the elements encountered so far.
- The final answer is the sum of these additional elements for each test case.

Potential Performance Bottlenecks:
1. Memory Usage: The code uses a vector to store the array of integers. This can lead to inefficient memory usage, especially for large test cases.
2. Redundant Computation: The code computes the running sum of the elements in the array for each iteration of the loop. This can be optimized to avoid redundant computation.
3. Redundant Division: The code repeatedly performs divisions by `k` to calculate the number of additional elements needed. This can be optimized to reduce the number of divisions.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Efficient Data Structure: Replace the vector with a dynamically allocated array to reduce memory overhead.
2. Running Sum Optimization: Compute the running sum of the elements in the array only once before the loop, and update it inside the loop.
3. Division Optimization: Instead of performing a division for each additional element, calculate the number of additional elements needed using integer division and modulo operations.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Replace the vector with a dynamically allocated array:
   - Instead of using `vector<ull> v(n)`, declare an array `ull* v = new ull[n]`.
   - This optimizes memory usage by avoiding the overhead of vector operations like dynamic resizing.
   - The array should be deallocated using `delete[] v` at the end of the program to avoid memory leaks.

2. Compute the running sum of the elements only once:
   - Before the loop, calculate the running sum of the elements in the array using a variable `sum`.
   - Inside the loop, update `sum += v[i]` instead of recomputing the running sum from scratch.
   - This optimization reduces redundant computation.

3. Optimize the calculation of additional elements needed:
   - Replace the if-else statement with a single calculation using integer division and modulo operations.
   - Instead of `x % k != 0`, use `x / k + (x % k != 0)`.
   - This optimization reduces the number of divisions needed.

4. Use a more efficient data type for `ans`:
   - Since `ans` represents the number of additional elements needed, it can be stored as an `unsigned int` instead of `unsigned long long int`.
   - This reduces memory usage and improves performance.

Optimized Code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  int t;
  std::cin >> t;

  while (t--) {
    unsigned int n, k;
    std::cin >> n >> k;

    unsigned long long int* v = new unsigned long long int[n];

    for (unsigned int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      std::cin >> v[i];
    }

    unsigned int ans = 0;
    unsigned long long int sum = v[0];

    for (unsigned int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
      unsigned long long int x = v[i] * 100 - sum * k;
      ans += x / k + (x % k != 0);
      sum += v[i];
    }

    std::cout << ans << std::endl;

    delete[] v;
  }

  return 0;
}
```

Optimization Trade-offs:
- The optimized code reduces memory usage by replacing the vector with a dynamically allocated array, and by using a more efficient data type for `ans`.
- The running sum optimization reduces redundant computation by computing the sum only once before the loop.
- The division optimization reduces the number of divisions needed by calculating the number of additional elements using integer division and modulo operations.
- These optimizations improve performance and reduce memory usage but may slightly increase code complexity due to the use of manual memory management and additional calculations.
