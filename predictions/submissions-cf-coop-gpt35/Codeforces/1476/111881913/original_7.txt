Upon analyzing the provided code, I have identified several potential areas for optimization:

1. Inefficient data structure usage: The code uses a vector to store the input values. However, since the size of the vector is known in advance, it is more efficient to use a fixed-size array.

2. Redundant computation: The code performs the computation `(v[i] * 100) > sum * k` multiple times within the loop. It would be more efficient to compute this value once and store it in a variable.

3. Unnecessary division: The code performs division by `k` multiple times. Since `k` is constant within each loop iteration, it is more efficient to perform the division once and store the result in a variable.

4. Unnecessary if-else statement: The code uses an if-else statement to determine whether to add 1 to the answer. However, this can be simplified by using integer division.

With these optimizations in mind, I will proceed with optimizing the code step by step.
