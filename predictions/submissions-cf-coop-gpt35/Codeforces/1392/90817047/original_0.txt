Code Analysis:
- The code reads an integer `t` from input, which represents the number of test cases.
- For each test case, the code reads an integer `n`, an unsigned long long `k`, and a vector `a` of size `n`.
- The code then calls the `solve` function with the vector `a` and the value of `k`.
- The `solve` function finds the minimum and maximum elements in the vector `a`, and subtracts each element from the maximum.
- If `k` is even, it subtracts the difference between the maximum and minimum elements from each element in the vector.
- Finally, the `answer` function prints the elements of the vector.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Avoid unnecessary memory allocation: The code currently uses a vector to store the input values. However, we can optimize memory usage by using a fixed-size array instead.
2. Optimize input/output operations: The code currently uses the `std::cin` and `std::cout` functions for input and output operations. These functions can be slow for large inputs or outputs. Instead, we can use the faster `scanf` and `printf` functions.
3. Simplify the logic: The code currently performs unnecessary operations, such as finding the minimum and maximum elements twice. We can simplify the logic to reduce the number of computations.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Replace vector with a fixed-size array: Instead of using `std::vector<int> a(n)`, we can use `int a[n]` to store the input values. This avoids the overhead of dynamic memory allocation and deallocation.
2. Replace `std::cin` and `std::cout` with `scanf` and `printf`: The `scanf` and `printf` functions are faster than `std::cin` and `std::cout` for input and output operations. We can replace the input operations with `scanf` and the output operations with `printf`.
3. Simplify the logic in the `solve` function:
   - Instead of finding the minimum and maximum elements using `std::minmax_element`, we can find them in a single pass.
   - Instead of subtracting each element from the maximum, we can subtract the maximum from all elements in a single pass.
   - Instead of checking if `k` is even and performing additional subtraction, we can subtract the difference between the maximum and minimum from all elements, regardless of the value of `k`.

Optimized Code Block:
```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <cstdio>

void answer(const int* a, int n) {
  const char* separator = "";
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    printf("%s%d", separator, a[i]);
    separator = " ";
  }
  printf("\n");
}

void solve(int* a, int n, unsigned long long k) {
  int min = a[0];
  int max = a[0];
  for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
    if (a[i] < min) min = a[i];
    if (a[i] > max) max = a[i];
  }
  int diff = max - min;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    a[i] = max - a[i];
    a[i] -= diff * (k % 2);
  }
  answer(a, n);
}

void test_case() {
  int n;
  unsigned long long k;
  scanf("%d %llu", &n, &k);
  int a[n];
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    scanf("%d", &a[i]);
  }
  solve(a, n, k);
}

int main() {
  int t;
  scanf("%d", &t);
  while (t-- > 0) {
    test_case();
  }
  return 0;
