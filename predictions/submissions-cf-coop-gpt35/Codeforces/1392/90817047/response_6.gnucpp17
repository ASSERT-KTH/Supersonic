## Code Analysis

Upon analyzing the given code, the following potential performance bottlenecks and inefficient memory usage can be identified:

1. The `solve` function performs two passes over the input vector `a` in order to find the minimum and maximum values. This can be optimized by finding the minimum and maximum values in a single pass.

2. The `solve` function modifies the input vector `a` in-place twice, which can be avoided by using a separate vector for the second modification.

3. The `answer` function concatenates the vector elements using a `separator` string, which can be optimized by using `std::ostringstream` for efficient string concatenation.

4. The `test_case` function creates a new vector `a` for each test case, which can be avoided by reusing the same vector.

## Optimization Strategy

Based on the code analysis, the following optimization strategy can be formulated:

1. Optimize the `solve` function to find the minimum and maximum values in a single pass, and avoid modifying the input vector `a` twice.

2. Optimize the `answer` function to use `std::ostringstream` for efficient string concatenation.

3. Modify the `test_case` function to reuse the same vector `a` for each test case.

## Step-by-Step Explanation

1. Optimize the `solve` function:
    - Instead of using `std::minmax_element` to find the minimum and maximum values in two passes, we can find them in a single pass by keeping track of the minimum and maximum values while iterating over the vector `a`.
    - Avoid modifying the input vector `a` twice by using a separate vector `result` to store the modified values.
    - If `k` is even, there is no need to modify the vector `result` again. Instead, we can directly subtract `min` from each element in `result`.
    - Finally, assign `result` back to `a` to update the original vector.

2. Optimize the `answer` function:
    - Replace the use of `const char* separator` and multiple calls to `std::cout` with a single `std::ostringstream` object.
    - Iterate over the vector `v` and append each element to the `std::ostringstream` object with a space separator.
    - Finally, get the concatenated string from the `std::ostringstream` object and print it using `std::cout`.

3. Modify the `test_case` function:
    - Instead of creating a new vector `a` for each test case, reuse the same vector by clearing it before reading the new input.
