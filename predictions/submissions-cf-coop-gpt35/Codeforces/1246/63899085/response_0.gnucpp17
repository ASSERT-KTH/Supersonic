The provided code calculates the number of pairs of integers whose GCD is a perfect square. The code uses the Miller-Rabin primality test and the Pollard-Rho algorithm for prime factorization.

However, there are several areas where the code can be optimized:

1. Redundant Computations: The `pow` function calculates the power of a number modulo a given number `mod`. However, this calculation is already being done in the `mul` function. We can remove the `pow` function and use the `mul` function directly in the `check` function.

2. Inefficient Data Structures: The code uses a `map` to store the factors of a number. However, using a `map` introduces a significant overhead due to the need for ordered storage. Since the factors are prime numbers, we can use a more efficient data structure like a `vector` to store the factors.

3. Inefficient Loop: The `dfs` function uses a recursive loop to calculate the number of pairs. This can be optimized by using a loop instead of recursion.

4. Compiler Optimizations: We can suggest some compiler optimizations or pragma directives that can hint the compiler to optimize certain parts of the code.
