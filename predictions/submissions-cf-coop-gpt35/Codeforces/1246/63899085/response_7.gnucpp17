Upon analyzing the given code, the following potential optimizations can be identified:

1. Avoid using the `bits/stdc++.h` header: This header includes a large number of standard library headers, which can significantly increase compile times and memory usage. It is better to include only the specific headers that are required by the code.

2. Optimize the `mul` function: The current implementation of the `mul` function uses repeated multiplication and modulo operations to calculate the result. This can be optimized by using exponentiation by squaring, which reduces the number of multiplications and mod operations required. Additionally, the modulo operation can be moved outside the loop to improve performance.

3. Optimize the `pow` function: Similar to the `mul` function, the `pow` function can also be optimized using exponentiation by squaring. The modulo operation can be moved outside the loop to improve performance.

4. Optimize the `check` function: The `check` function performs multiple multiplications and modulo operations in a loop. This can be optimized by using the `pow` function to calculate the exponentiation and storing the intermediate results in a variable.

5. Optimize the `Miller_Rabin` function: The current implementation of the `Miller_Rabin` function performs a fixed number of iterations using a pre-defined array of values. This can be optimized by using a probabilistic approach, where the number of iterations is determined based on the size of the input number.

6. Optimize the `Pollard_rho` function: The current implementation of the `Pollard_rho` function uses a while loop to find a factor of the input number. This can be optimized by using a do-while loop to eliminate the need for the initial assignment of `x` and `y`.

7. Optimize the `factorize` function: The current implementation of the `factorize` function uses recursion to factorize the input number. This can be optimized by using an iterative approach, which can help reduce memory usage and stack overhead.

8. Optimize the `dfs` function: The `dfs` function uses recursion to iterate over the factors of a number. This can be optimized by using an iterative approach, which can help reduce memory usage and stack overhead.

9. Optimize the `getprime` function: The `getprime` function uses a sieve algorithm to generate a list of prime numbers. This can be optimized by using a more efficient sieve algorithm, such as the Sieve of Eratosthenes.

10. Avoid using the `map` container: The use of the `map` container in the code can introduce overhead due to the underlying tree structure. In cases where a sorted map is not required, using a `unordered_map` can provide better performance.
