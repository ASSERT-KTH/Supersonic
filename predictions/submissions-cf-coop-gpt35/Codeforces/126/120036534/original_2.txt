After analyzing the provided code, I have identified several potential areas for optimization:

1. Unnecessary includes: The code includes several unnecessary headers, such as `bits/stdc++.h` and `ext/pb_ds/assoc_container.hpp`. These headers can be removed to reduce compilation time.

2. Unused code: The code defines several unused functions, such as `make_unique` and the debug printing functions. These functions can be safely removed to improve code clarity and reduce memory usage.

3. Redundant string manipulation: The code uses the `substr` function to extract a substring from a string. Instead, we can use the `string_view` class to avoid unnecessary memory allocation and copying.

4. Inefficient data structures: The code uses a `multiset` to store the values of the Z-function. However, we only need to find the maximum Z-value that occurs at the end of the string. Therefore, we can use a simple variable to store this maximum value.

5. Inefficient loop: The code uses a loop to iterate over the Z-values and find the maximum value that occurs at the end of the string. However, we can optimize this by iterating in reverse order and maintaining the maximum value as we go.

Based on these observations, here is the step-by-step optimization strategy:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: Remove the unnecessary headers `bits/stdc++.h` and `ext/pb_ds/assoc_container.hpp` from the code.

2. Remove unused code: Remove the unused functions `make_unique` and the debug printing functions from the code.

3. Replace string manipulation: Replace the usage of the `substr` function with `string_view` to avoid unnecessary memory allocation and copying.

4. Replace data structure: Replace the `multiset` with a simple variable to store the maximum Z-value that occurs at the end of the string.

5. Optimize loop: Optimize the loop that iterates over the Z-values and find the maximum value that occurs at the end of the string by iterating in reverse order and maintaining the maximum value as we go.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

const string p = "Just a legend";

vector<int> Z(const string& s) {
    int n = s.size();
    vector<int> z(n);
    for (int i = 1, l = 0, r = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (i <= r)
            z[i] = min(r - i + 1, z[i - l]);
        while (i + z[i] < n && s[z[i]] == s[z[i] + i]) {
            ++z[i];
        }
        if (i + z[i] - 1 > r) {
            l = i;
            r = i + z[i] - 1;
        }
    }
    return z;
}

int main() {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(0);
    cout.tie(0);

    string s;
    cin >> s;
    
    int n = s.size();
    vector<int> z = Z(s);
    
    int maxZ = -1;
    for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
        if (i + z[i] == n) {
            if (z[i] > maxZ) {
                maxZ = z[i];
            }
        }
    }
    
    if (maxZ == -1) {
        cout << p;
    } else {
        cout << string_view(s).substr(0, maxZ);
    }
    
    return 0;
}
```

By implementing these optimizations, we have reduced unnecessary code and improved the efficiency of the program.
