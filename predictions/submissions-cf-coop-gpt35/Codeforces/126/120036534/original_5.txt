The given code is a C++ program that finds the longest prefix of a string `s` that is also a suffix of `s`. The program uses the Z algorithm to calculate the Z values for each position in the string `s`, and then iterates over the Z values to find the longest prefix that is also a suffix.

Upon analyzing the code, the following potential areas for optimization can be identified:

1. Redundant headers: The code includes several unnecessary header files, such as `bits/stdc++.h` and `ext/pb_ds/*`. These headers may introduce unnecessary dependencies and increase compilation time. It is recommended to include only the necessary headers.

2. Unused template aliases: The code defines a template alias `minpq` and a function template `make_unique`, but they are not used in the program. These definitions can be removed to reduce code clutter.

3. Debugging macros: The code includes a set of macros for debugging purposes (`__print`, `_print`, `debug`). While these macros can be useful during development, they are not necessary for the optimized version. These macros can be removed from the code to improve readability.

4. Unnecessary string transformations: The code includes two string transformation functions (`tol` and `tou`) that transform a string to lowercase and uppercase, respectively. These functions are not used in the program and can be safely removed.

5. Unnecessary macros: The code includes several macros that are not used in the program, such as `pi`, `ld`, `precise`, `OS`, etc. These macros can be removed to reduce code clutter.

6. Redundant data types: The code uses multiple data type aliases (`ll`, `ull`, `vvc`, `vvi`, etc.) that are not necessary. Using standard data types, such as `long long`, `unsigned long long`, `vector<vector<char>>`, `vector<vector<int>>`, etc., would improve code readability.

7. Unnecessary includes: The code includes unnecessary includes for standard library headers (`<iostream>`, `<vector>`, `<string>`, etc.) that are not used in the program. These includes can be removed to reduce compilation time.

8. Unoptimized string operations: The code performs several unnecessary string operations, such as `s.substr(0, ans)`. These operations can be optimized to avoid unnecessary copies and improve performance.

Based on these observations, the following optimization strategy can be formulated:

1. Remove unnecessary headers, template aliases, and function templates.
2. Remove debugging macros and unused macros.
3. Remove unnecessary string transformations and macros.
4. Use standard data types instead of aliases for improved readability.
5. Remove unnecessary includes for standard library headers.
6. Optimize string operations to avoid unnecessary copies.

Next, we will go through each optimization step in detail and provide the optimized code.
