Code Analysis:

1. The code includes several unnecessary header files, such as `<bits/stdc++.h>`, `<ext/pb_ds/assoc_container.hpp>`, and `<ext/pb_ds/tree_policy.hpp>`.
2. The code includes a large number of unnecessary debugging functions and macros.
3. The code includes several unnecessary type aliases and constants.
4. The code includes several unnecessary using statements.
5. The code includes several unnecessary functions and utilities.
6. The code uses a multiset to store the values of `z[i]`, which is inefficient and not needed for the given problem.
7. The code iterates over the multiset `ss` multiple times, which can be optimized.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Remove unnecessary header files, such as `<bits/stdc++.h>`, `<ext/pb_ds/assoc_container.hpp>`, and `<ext/pb_ds/tree_policy.hpp>`.
2. Remove unnecessary debugging functions and macros.
3. Remove unnecessary type aliases and constants.
4. Remove unnecessary using statements.
5. Remove unnecessary functions and utilities.
6. Replace the multiset `ss` with a variable to store the maximum value of `z[i]`.
7. Optimize the loop that iterates over `ss` to find the maximum value of `z[i]`.

Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. Remove unnecessary header files:
   - The header files `<bits/stdc++.h>`, `<ext/pb_ds/assoc_container.hpp>`, and `<ext/pb_ds/tree_policy.hpp>` are not needed for this code and can be removed.

2. Remove unnecessary debugging functions and macros:
   - The functions `__print` and `_print` are used for debugging purposes and can be removed.
   - The macro `debug` can be removed as well.

3. Remove unnecessary type aliases and constants:
   - The type aliases `ll`, `ull`, `ld`, `vvc`, `vpl`, `vvi`, and `vvl` are not used and can be removed.
   - The constants `inf`, `M`, and `MM` are not used and can be removed.

4. Remove unnecessary using statements:
   - The `using` statements for `__gnu_pbds`, `minpq`, and `tree` are not used and can be removed.

5. Remove unnecessary functions and utilities:
   - The function `make_unique` is not used and can be removed.
   - The function `Z` is not used and can be removed.
   - The functions `add`, `mul`, `power`, `binpow`, `is_prime`, `lcm`, `Ceil`, `inv`, `C`, and `ispalindrome` are not used and can be removed.
   - The struct `custom_hash` is not used and can be removed.

6. Replace the multiset `ss` with a variable:
   - Instead of using a multiset to store the values of `z[i]`, we can simply use a variable `maxZ` to store the maximum value of `z[i]`.

7. Optimize the loop that iterates over `ss`:
   - Instead of iterating over `ss` multiple times, we can optimize the loop by keeping track of the maximum value of `z[i]` as we iterate over it.
