The provided code calculates a sum using a series of mathematical operations on an array of pairs (`ar`). The sum is then multiplied by a constant value (`2000`) and printed as the output. 

To optimize this code, we can focus on the following areas:
1. Efficient data structures: The code currently uses an array of `pll` (pair of long long) to store the input values. We can replace this array with more efficient data structures that do not require unnecessary memory allocations and deallocations.
2. Redundant computations: The code contains redundant computations in the loops, where the same calculations are performed multiple times. We can eliminate these redundancies to improve performance.
3. Compiler optimizations: We can suggest compiler optimizations or pragma directives to hint the compiler to optimize certain parts of the code.
