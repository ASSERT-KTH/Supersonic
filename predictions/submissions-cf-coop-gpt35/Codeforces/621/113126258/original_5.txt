Upon analyzing the given code, here are some potential optimizations that can be applied:

1. Avoid unnecessary includes: The code includes the entire `<bits/stdc++.h>` library, which is not necessary. Instead, include only the necessary headers, such as `<iostream>` and `<iomanip>` for input/output operations.

2. Avoid unnecessary macros: The code defines macros for `ll`, `mod`, `pii`, `pll`, `N`, `forn`, `fio`, `pb`, and `ld`. These macros are not used in the code and can be removed.

3. Avoid unnecessary use of floating-point types: The code uses `ld` (long double) for calculations, but the precision required for the output is set to 6 decimal places. Using `double` instead of `ld` can improve performance without sacrificing accuracy.

4. Avoid unnecessary array initialization: The code initializes `ar[-1]` and `pref[-1]` with arbitrary values. Since the indices `-1` are not used, these initializations can be removed.

5. Avoid unnecessary use of `pb` function: The code uses `pb` (push_back) function to add elements to the `ar` vector. However, the vector `ar` can be replaced with a fixed-size array since the size is known at compile-time.

6. Simplify the calculation of `sum`: The calculation of `sum` involves multiple divisions and multiplications. By simplifying the expressions and minimizing redundant calculations, the performance can be improved.

7. Optimize the loop: The loop from `i=1` to `n-1` can be optimized by reducing the number of calculations performed in each iteration.

Based on these observations, here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <iomanip>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(NULL);
    cout.tie(NULL);

    int n, p;
    cin >> n >> p;

    long long ar[n][2];
    long long pref[n];

    long double sum = 0;

    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        long long a, b;
        cin >> a >> b;

        ar[i][0] = b / p - (a - 1) / p;
        ar[i][1] = b - a + 1;

        if (i == 0)
            pref[i] = ar[i][1];
        else
            pref[i] = pref[i - 1] * ar[i][1];
    }

    sum += (long double)1 / ar[0][1];
    sum *= 2;
    sum *= ar[0][0];

    sum += (long double)ar[n - 1][0] / ar[n - 1][1] / ar[n - 2][1] * (ar[n - 2][1] - ar[n - 2][0]);
    sum += (long double)ar[n - 1][0] / ar[n - 1][1] / ar[0][1] * (ar[0][1] - ar[0][0]);

    for (int i = 1; i < n - 1; i++) {
        sum += (long double)ar[i][0] / ar[i][1];
        sum += (long double)ar[i][0] / ar[i][1] / ar[i - 1][1] * (ar[i - 1][1] - ar[i - 1][0]);
    }

    cout << setprecision(6) << fixed;
    cout << (long double)sum * (long double)2000 << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

This optimized code eliminates unnecessary includes, macros, and function calls. It also simplifies the calculations and optimizes the loop.
