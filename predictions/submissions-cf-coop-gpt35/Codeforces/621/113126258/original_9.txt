The provided code calculates a sum based on a sequence of pairs of integers `a` and `b`, where `a` and `b` are input from the user. The sum is then multiplied by 2000 and printed as output.

Upon analyzing the code, I have identified a few potential areas for optimization:

1. Unnecessary includes: The code includes the entire `<bits/stdc++.h>` header, which is not necessary and can result in increased compile time and unnecessary memory usage. It is recommended to include only the required headers.

2. Redundant calculations in loop: The loop from `i = 1` to `n - 2` performs the same calculation twice. This can be optimized to perform the calculation only once.

3. Inefficient data structures: The code uses arrays `ar` and `pref` to store the input values and their prefix sums. However, using a vector instead of an array can provide the benefits of dynamic memory allocation and resizing, resulting in more efficient memory usage.

4. Redundant calculations in sum calculation: The calculation of the sum involves multiple divisions and multiplications. Simplifying the expression can reduce the number of computations.

Based on these observations, I propose the following optimization steps:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: Replace the `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` with the necessary headers, such as `<iostream>`, `<iomanip>`, and `<vector>`. This will reduce unnecessary code and improve compile time.

2. Replace arrays with vectors: Replace the arrays `ar` and `pref` with vectors. This will allow for dynamic memory allocation and resizing, resulting in more efficient memory usage.

3. Simplify sum calculation: Simplify the expression for calculating the sum by reducing the number of divisions and multiplications. This can be achieved by combining common terms and simplifying the arithmetic.

Let's now optimize the code by implementing these steps:
