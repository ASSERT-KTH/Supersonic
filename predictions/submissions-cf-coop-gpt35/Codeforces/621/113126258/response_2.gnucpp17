The provided code calculates a sum based on an input array of pairs of integers. The sum is then multiplied by a constant and printed as output. 

Upon analyzing the code, several optimizations can be proposed:
1. Use `vector` instead of arrays: The code currently uses C-style arrays (`pll ar[N]` and `ll pref[N]`). However, it would be more efficient to use `std::vector` because it automatically manages memory allocation and resizing. This avoids potential buffer overflows and reduces the risk of memory leaks.

2. Avoid unnecessary calculations: The code performs some unnecessary calculations on the `ar` array. For example, the code initializes `ar[-1].first` and `ar[-1].second`, which are not used later in the code. Similarly, `pref[-1]` is initialized to 1 but not used. These calculations can be removed to improve performance.

3. Reduce precision: The code sets the precision of the output to 6 decimal places using `setprecision(6)`. However, if the precision requirement is lower, this can be reduced to improve performance.

4. Avoid repeated division: The code performs multiple divisions, such as `(ld)ar[n - 1].second / (ld)ar[n - 1].first`, `(ld)ar[i].second / (ld)ar[i].first`, and `(ld)ar[i].second / (ld)ar[i].first / (ld)ar[i - 1].first`. These divisions can be reduced by storing the inverse of the divisor in a variable and multiplying instead. This can improve performance since multiplication is generally faster than division.
