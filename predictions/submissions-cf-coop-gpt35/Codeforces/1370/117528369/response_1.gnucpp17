Code Analysis:
- The code includes several unnecessary header files that are not used in the program. These can be removed to improve compilation time and reduce memory usage.
- The code uses several macros that alias common data types, such as `ll`, `int`, `ld`, etc. While this might make the code more readable, it can also lead to confusion and potential bugs. It is recommended to remove these macros and use the standard data types directly.
- The code defines unnecessary string constants `Y` and `N`. These can be removed as they are not used in the program.
- The code uses the `w(t)` macro to define the number of test cases. This macro can be replaced with a regular `for` loop to improve readability.
- The code uses a loop to calculate the answer for each test case. However, the loop can be optimized by using a mathematical formula to calculate the answer directly, without the need for iteration.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Remove unnecessary header files.
2. Remove unnecessary macros and use standard data types directly.
3. Remove unused string constants.
4. Replace the `w(t)` macro with a regular `for` loop.
5. Replace the loop for calculating the answer with a mathematical formula.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Remove unnecessary header files: The code includes `<bits/stdc++.h>` header file, which is not required. Only include the necessary header files for the program, such as `<iostream>` and `<vector>`.

2. Remove unnecessary macros and use standard data types directly: The code defines macros for common data types such as `ll`, `int`, `ld`, etc. It is better to use the standard data types directly (`long long`, `int`, `long double`, etc.) for better readability and to avoid potential bugs.

3. Remove unused string constants: The code defines string constants `Y` and `N`, but they are not used in the program. Remove these constants to reduce unnecessary memory usage.

4. Replace the `w(t)` macro with a regular `for` loop: The code uses the `w(t)` macro to define the number of test cases. However, it is more readable to use a regular `for` loop to iterate over the test cases.

5. Replace the loop for calculating the answer with a mathematical formula: The current loop iterates from `n-1` to `1` and checks if `i*2 <= n`. This can be optimized by using a mathematical formula to calculate the answer directly. The answer for each test case can be calculated as `ans = n/2 - 1`.
