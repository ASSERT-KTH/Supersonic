Code Analysis:
- The code reads two integers from the user and calculates the value of `n` as `7 - max(a, b)`.
- The value of `n` is then used in a switch statement to determine the output.
- The output is a fraction based on the value of `n`.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Replace the `max` function with a simple comparison to find the maximum of `a` and `b`.
2. Replace the switch statement with a direct mapping from `n` to the fraction output.
3. Avoid unnecessary I/O operations by storing the fraction output in a string variable and printing it at the end.
4. Use compiler optimizations to improve performance.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Instead of using the `max` function, we can use a simple comparison to find the maximum of `a` and `b`. This eliminates the overhead of a function call.
2. Instead of using a switch statement, we can directly map the value of `n` to the fraction output using an array or a lookup table. This reduces the branching and improves the efficiency.
3. Rather than printing the fraction immediately, we can store it in a string variable and print it at the end. This avoids unnecessary I/O operations and improves performance.
4. We can enable compiler optimizations to further improve the performance. This can be done by passing appropriate compiler flags or using pragma directives to provide hints to the compiler.

Optimized Code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int a, b, n;
  cin >> a >> b;
  n = (a > b) ? (7 - a) : (7 - b);

  string fraction;
  switch (n) {
    case 1:
      fraction = "1/6";
      break;
    case 2:
      fraction = "1/3";
      break;
    case 3:
      fraction = "1/2";
      break;
    case 4:
      fraction = "2/3";
      break;
    case 5:
      fraction = "5/6";
      break;
    case 6:
      fraction = "1/1";
      break;
  }

  cout << fraction;

  return 0;
}
```

In this optimized code:
- The `max` function is replaced with a simple comparison `(a > b)` to find the maximum of `a` and `b`.
- The switch statement is unchanged, but the fraction output is stored in a string variable instead of being printed immediately.
- Compiler optimizations are not explicitly mentioned here, but you can enable them by passing appropriate compiler flags or using pragma directives.
