Code Analysis:
- The code takes two inputs, `a` and `b`, and computes `n` as the difference between 7 and the maximum of `a` and `b`.
- The code then uses a switch statement to print out a fraction based on the value of `n`.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Since the code only uses `a` and `b` to compute `n`, we can remove the unnecessary variables and directly compute `n` using `n = 7 - max(a, b)`.
2. Instead of using a switch statement, we can use an array to store the fractions and directly access the fraction based on the value of `n`.
3. We can remove the `using namespace std;` line and replace `cout` with `std::cout` to avoid namespace pollution.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Remove the unnecessary variables `a` and `b`.
2. Compute `n` directly using `n = 7 - max(a, b)`.
3. Create an array `fractions` to store the fractions.
4. Access the fraction directly using `fractions[n]` instead of using a switch statement.
5. Replace `cout` with `std::cout` to avoid namespace pollution.

Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>

int main() {
  int n;
  std::cin >> n;
  n = 7 - std::max(0, n);

  std::string fractions[] = {"1/6", "1/3", "1/2", "2/3", "5/6", "1/1"};
  std::cout << fractions[n-1];

  return 0;
}
```

In this optimized code, unnecessary variables are removed, the computation of `n` is simplified, and a switch statement is replaced with a direct access to a fraction using an array. The code also avoids using `using namespace std;` and uses `std::cout` instead of `cout`. These changes improve the efficiency of the code by reducing unnecessary computations and improving code readability.
