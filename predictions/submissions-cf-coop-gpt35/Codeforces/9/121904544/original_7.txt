Code Analysis:
- The code reads two integers from the input and calculates a value "n" based on the maximum of the two integers.
- Then, using a switch statement, it prints a fraction based on the value of "n".

Optimization Strategy:
1. Remove the "using namespace std;" line to avoid namespace pollution and improve code clarity.
2. Replace the switch statement with a simple if-else chain to avoid the overhead of the switch statement.
3. Instead of using the "max" function, manually compare the two integers to find the maximum.
4. Use a lookup table to directly map the value of "n" to the corresponding fraction, avoiding the need for if-else statements or switch statements.
5. Add comments to explain the optimization steps and make the code more readable.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Remove the "using namespace std;" line:
   - The "using namespace std;" statement brings all the names from the std namespace into the global namespace, which can lead to naming conflicts and make the code less readable. It is better to explicitly use the std namespace when needed.

2. Replace the switch statement with an if-else chain:
   - The switch statement introduces extra overhead due to the internal jump table used for selecting the appropriate case. In this case, since we have a small number of cases, an if-else chain will be more efficient.

3. Manually compare the two integers to find the maximum:
   - The max(a, b) function call introduces an unnecessary function call overhead. Instead, we can compare the two integers directly and store the maximum in a variable.

4. Use a lookup table:
   - Since the possible values of "n" are limited and well-defined, we can use a lookup table to directly map the value of "n" to the corresponding fraction. This eliminates the need for if-else or switch statements and improves performance.

5. Add comments:
   - Add comments to explain the optimization steps and make the code more readable and maintainable.

Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  int a, b, n;
  std::cin >> a >> b;

  // Find the maximum of a and b
  int maxNum = (a > b) ? a : b;

  // Calculate n based on the maximum
  n = 7 - maxNum;

  // Lookup table for fractions
  const char* fractions[] = {"1/6", "1/3", "1/2", "2/3", "5/6", "1/1"};

  // Print the fraction based on n
  if (n >= 1 && n <= 6) {
    std::cout << fractions[n - 1];
  }

  return 0;
}
```

The optimized code is well-commented and preserves the functionality and output of the original code. It avoids unnecessary function calls, reduces the branching logic, and uses a lookup table for improved efficiency.
