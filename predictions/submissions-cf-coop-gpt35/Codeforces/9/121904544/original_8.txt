Code Analysis:
The given code accepts two integers `a` and `b` as input, calculates `n` as the difference between 7 and the maximum of `a` and `b`, and then uses a switch statement to print a fraction based on the value of `n`. 

Optimization Strategy:
1. Avoid unnecessary input/output operations: Since the code only requires `a` and `b` as input and prints the result, we can remove the `using namespace std;` line as well as the `cin` and `cout` statements. Instead, we can directly pass `a` and `b` as parameters to the `main` function and return the result as an integer.

2. Replace switch statement with an array lookup: Instead of using a switch statement, we can use an array to directly look up the fraction based on the value of `n`. This will eliminate the need for multiple comparisons and improve performance.

3. Use const variables: We can use const variables for the fractions to avoid magic numbers in the code.

4. Add comments: Add comments to explain the purpose of each section of code and the optimizations made.

Optimized Code:
```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
  // Accept inputs as command line arguments
  int a = std::stoi(argv[1]);
  int b = std::stoi(argv[2]);

  // Calculate n as the difference between 7 and the maximum of a and b
  int n = 7 - std::max(a, b);

  // Lookup the fraction based on the value of n
  const std::string fractions[] = {"1/6", "1/3", "1/2", "2/3", "5/6", "1/1"};
  std::string result = fractions[n-1];

  // Print the result
  std::cout << result;

  return 0;
}
```

Explanation:
1. We remove the `using namespace std;` line to avoid namespace pollution.

2. The `a` and `b` variables are passed as command line arguments and converted to integers using `std::stoi`.

3. The calculation of `n` remains the same.

4. We replace the switch statement with an array lookup using the `n` value. The fractions are stored in a `const` array of strings.

5. The result is stored in the `result` variable.

6. The result is printed using `std::cout`.

Trade-offs:
- The optimized code reduces the number of comparisons and eliminates the need for a switch statement, improving performance.
- The use of command line arguments instead of input prompts reduces the need for user interaction.
- The code is more concise and easier to understand.
- However, the optimized code requires the input to be provided as command line arguments, which may not be suitable for all use cases.
