Upon analyzing the given code, we can identify a few areas that can be optimized:

1. The use of `using namespace std` is generally discouraged, as it pollutes the global namespace. It is better to explicitly specify the namespace for each identifier used from the `std` namespace.

2. The `max(a, b)` function call is unnecessary. Since we are only comparing two values, we can directly use an if-else ladder to determine the maximum.

3. The switch statement can be replaced with a simple array lookup. This will eliminate the need for multiple comparisons and improve readability.

4. The output statements can be combined to reduce the number of function calls to `cout`. Instead of printing the fractions directly, we can store them in an array and use a single `cout` statement to print the result.
