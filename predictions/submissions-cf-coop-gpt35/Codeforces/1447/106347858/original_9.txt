Code Analysis:
1. The code includes unnecessary header files. The inclusion of "bits/stdc++.h" is generally discouraged as it includes all the standard library headers, resulting in increased compilation time and unnecessary memory usage.
2. The use of macros for defining constants and loops can make the code less readable and harder to debug.
3. The pow() function is implemented to calculate power modulo m. However, the function is not used in the main code, so it can be removed.
4. The code uses an inefficient method to calculate the minimum value in each iteration of the nested loops. It initializes mn with INT_MAX and updates it for every element, resulting in unnecessary comparisons.
5. The code uses unnecessary multiplication and modulo operations in the pow() function and for updating the ans variable. These operations can be reduced to improve performance.
6. The code uses bitwise operations for division and right shift. However, these operations are not necessary and can be replaced with regular division and assignment operators.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Remove unnecessary header files and macros to reduce compilation time and memory usage.
2. Remove the pow() function as it is not used in the main code.
3. Replace the nested loops with a single loop to iterate over all elements in a flattened array.
4. Calculate the minimum value (mn) and the number of negative elements (ne) in a single loop iteration to reduce unnecessary comparisons and iterations.
5. Update the ans variable in a single loop iteration by eliminating unnecessary multiplication and modulo operations.
6. Simplify the condition for checking if the number of negative elements and the total number of non-positive elements is odd.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Remove unnecessary header files and macros:
   - Remove the line `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` as it includes unnecessary standard library headers. Instead, include only the necessary headers.
   - Remove the macros `int long long`, `rep()`, `mod`, and `inf`. Instead, use regular data types and loops.

2. Remove the pow() function:
   - Remove the entire `pow()` function as it is not used in the main code.

3. Replace the nested loops with a single loop:
   - Remove the nested loops `rep(i, 0, n)` and `rep(j, 0, m)`.
   - Replace them with a single loop `rep(k, 0, n * m)` to iterate over all elements in a flattened array.
   - Update the variable `x` to access the elements using the index `k`.

4. Calculate the minimum value and number of negative elements:
   - Remove the initialization of `mn` with `INT_MAX`.
   - Initialize `mn` with the first element of the array.
   - Update `mn` by comparing it with each element `x` in the loop, i.e., `mn = min(mn, x)`.
   - Remove the separate loop to count the number of negative elements.
   - Initialize `ne` to 0 before the loop.
   - Update `ne` by checking if `x` is negative, i.e., `if (x < 0) ne++;`.

5. Update the ans variable:
   - Remove the unnecessary multiplication and modulo operations from the loop.
   - Instead of `ans += x`, use `ans = ans + x` to update the ans variable.

6. Simplify the condition for checking odd number of negative elements and non-positive elements:
   - Replace the condition `if (ne & 1 and (ne + o) & 1)` with `if (ne % 2 != 0 && (ne + o) % 2 != 0)`.
   - This simplifies the condition and avoids the use of bitwise operations.

Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <climits>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(NULL);

    int T;
    cin >> T;
    while (T--) {
        int n, m;
        cin >> n >> m;
        int ne = 0, ans = 0, mn;
        cin >> mn;
        if (mn < 0) {
            mn *= -1;
            ne++;
        }
        if (mn <= 0) {
            ans++;
        }
        for (int k = 1; k < n * m; k++) {
            int x;
            cin >> x;
            if (x < 0) {
                x *= -1;
                ne++;
            }
            if (x <= 0) {
                ans++;
            }
            mn = min(mn, x);
            ans = ans + x;
        }
        if (ne % 2 != 0 && (ne + ans) % 2 != 0) {
            cout << ans - 2 * mn;
        } else {
            cout << ans;
        }
        cout << '\n';
    }

    return 0;
}
```

The optimized code eliminates unnecessary header files and macros, removes the unused pow() function, simplifies the loops, reduces unnecessary comparisons, eliminates unnecessary operations, and simplifies the condition for checking odd number of negative elements and non-positive elements. These optimizations improve the efficiency of the code by reducing memory usage and improving running time.
