Upon analyzing the provided code, I have identified several areas that can be optimized for efficiency:

1. Redundant includes: The code is including the entire "bits/stdc++.h" header, which is considered bad practice and can lead to unnecessary bloat and longer compile times. It is better to include only the necessary standard library headers.

2. Unnecessary macros: The macros for "int long long", "rep", "mod", and "inf" are not being used in the code and can be removed.

3. Unoptimized power function: The power function is currently using a basic iterative approach to calculate the power of a number modulo m. This can be optimized further using exponentiation by squaring technique, which reduces the number of multiplications required.

4. Excessive use of modulus operator: The code is using the modulus operator extensively, which can slow down the program. It is better to minimize the number of modulus operations and perform them only when necessary.

5. Redundant variables: The variables "ne" and "o" are not being used for any calculations or comparisons. They can be removed to reduce unnecessary memory usage.

6. Unoptimized input/output operations: The code is currently using "cin" and "cout" for input and output operations. These operations can be slow, especially when performing large input/output operations. Using a faster alternative, such as "scanf" and "printf", can improve performance.

To optimize the code, I will take the following steps:

Step 1: Remove unnecessary includes and macros.
Step 2: Optimize the power function using exponentiation by squaring.
Step 3: Minimize the use of modulus operations.
Step 4: Remove redundant variables.
Step 5: Replace "cin" and "cout" with "scanf" and "printf".

Here's the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cstdio>
#include <climits>

using namespace std;

int power(int p, int r, int m) {
  int ans = 1;
  while (r > 0) {
    if (r & 1) {
      ans = (ans * p) % m;
    }
    r = r >> 1;
    p = (p * p) % m;
  }
  return ans;
}

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);

#ifndef ONLINE_JUDGE
  freopen("input.txt", "r", stdin);
  freopen("output.txt", "w", stdout);
#endif

  int T;
  scanf("%d", &T);
  while (T--) {
    int n, m;
    scanf("%d %d", &n, &m);
    int ans = 0, mn = INT_MAX;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      for (int j = 0; j < m; j++) {
        int x;
        scanf("%d", &x);
        if (x < 0)
          x *= -1;
        mn = min(mn, x);
        ans += x;
      }
    }
    printf("%d\n", ans - 2 * mn);
  }

  return 0;
}
```

By following these optimization steps, we have reduced unnecessary operations, improved the power function, and replaced slow input/output operations, resulting in a more efficient and faster program.
