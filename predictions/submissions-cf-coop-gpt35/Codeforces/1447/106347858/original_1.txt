## Code Analysis
Upon analyzing the given code, I have identified the following potential areas for optimization:

1. The code includes unnecessary header files, such as `bits/stdc++.h`, which can slow down the compilation process. We should include only the necessary header files.

2. The use of `#define` for constants like `int` and `mod` is not recommended. It is better to use `const` instead.

3. The `pow` function is implemented to calculate the power of a number. However, the standard library already provides a `pow` function that can be used instead.

4. The code uses nested loops to iterate over the input matrix, which can lead to poor cache performance. We can optimize this by using a linear array instead of a nested loop.

5. The code uses bitwise operations (`&` and `>>`) to check if a number is odd and to divide it by 2. This can be replaced with more readable and efficient code.

6. The code uses `cin` and `cout` for input and output operations, which can be slower compared to other input/output methods, such as `scanf` and `printf`.

## Optimization Strategy
Based on the code analysis, the following optimization strategy can be formulated:

1. Replace unnecessary header files with the necessary ones.

2. Replace `#define` with `const` for constants.

3. Replace the custom `pow` function with the standard library `pow` function.

4. Optimize the nested loops by using a linear array instead.

5. Replace bitwise operations with more readable and efficient code.

6. Replace `cin` and `cout` with `scanf` and `printf` for input and output operations.

## Step-by-Step Explanation

### Step 1: Replace unnecessary header files
The `bits/stdc++.h` header file includes a large number of standard header files, which can increase the compilation time. We should include only the necessary header files. In this case, we need only the `<iostream>` and `<algorithm>` header files.

### Step 2: Replace `#define` with `const`
The `#define` preprocessor directive is used to define constants, but it is not recommended in modern C++. Instead, we can use `const` to define constants. In this case, we can replace `#define int long long` with `typedef long long int ll;` to define `int` as `long long`.

### Step 3: Replace the custom `pow` function
The custom `pow` function can be replaced with the standard library `pow` function, which is more optimized and efficient.

### Step 4: Optimize the nested loops
Instead of using nested loops to iterate over the input matrix, we can use a linear array and calculate the index using the formula `(i * m) + j`. This will improve cache performance and reduce the number of loop iterations.

### Step 5: Replace bitwise operations
The bitwise operations (`&` and `>>`) used to check if a number is odd and to divide it by 2 can be replaced with more readable and efficient code. We can use the `%` operator to check if a number is odd, and simply divide the number by 2 using the `/` operator.

### Step 6: Replace `cin` and `cout` with `scanf` and `printf`
The `cin` and `cout` operations can be slower compared to other input/output methods, such as `scanf` and `printf`. We can replace `cin` with `scanf` and `cout` with `printf` to improve performance.
