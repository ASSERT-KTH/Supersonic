The given code appears to be a solution to a programming problem. It reads input values `a`, `b`, and `c` in a loop and performs some calculations based on those values. The main bottleneck in this code lies in the `g` function, which calculates the number of digits in a given number. The function uses a loop to divide the number by 10 until it becomes zero, counting the iterations as the number of digits. This approach has a time complexity of O(log n), where n is the input number.

To optimize the code, we can use a mathematical formula to directly calculate the number of digits in a given number. The number of digits in a positive integer n can be calculated as `floor(log10(n) + 1)`. This approach has a time complexity of O(1), which is significantly faster than the previous approach.

Here is the optimized code with the improvements made:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>
using namespace std;

void solve() {
  int a, b, c;
  cin >> a >> b >> c;
  
  int x = pow(10, c - 1); // Calculate the smallest number with c digits
  
  int ans1 = pow(10, a - 1); // Calculate the smallest number with a digits
  
  int ans2 = pow(10, b - 1); // Calculate the smallest number with b digits
  
  cout << ans1 * x << " " << ans2 << endl;
}

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(nullptr);
  cout.tie(nullptr);
  
  int t = 1;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    solve();
  }
  
  return 0;
}
```

In this optimized code, we have removed unnecessary headers, typedefs, and preprocessor macros that were not being used. We have also simplified the I/O operations by removing the `fast` macro and using `cin.tie(nullptr)` and `cout.tie(nullptr)` to untie the cin and cout streams for a performance improvement.

The `g` function has been replaced with direct mathematical calculations using the `pow` function from the `<cmath>` library. This eliminates the need for a loop and reduces the time complexity to O(1).

Overall, these optimizations improve the efficiency of the code by reducing unnecessary computations and improving the time complexity of the number of digit calculations.
