The given code seems to solve a problem where it takes three inputs `a`, `b`, and `c` and finds two numbers `ans1` and `ans2` such that the number of digits in `ans1` is `a` and the number of trailing zeroes in `ans2` is `b`. The code uses a while loop and a function `g()` to find the numbers `x`, `i`, and `j` which satisfy the given conditions. However, there are several areas where the code can be optimized for efficiency.

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The code includes the entire `bits/stdc++.h` library, which is not recommended as it increases the compilation time and can lead to name conflicts. Instead, include only the required headers.

2. Avoid using `using namespace std`: This statement brings all names from the `std` namespace into the global namespace, which can cause conflicts and make the code less maintainable. Instead, use the `std::` prefix when using names from the `std` namespace.

3. Avoid unnecessary type definitions: The type aliases `ll`, `ull`, and `ld` are defined but not used in the provided code. Remove these aliases to reduce clutter.

4. Avoid unnecessary macros: The macros `INF`, `pb`, `pob`, `ff`, `ss`, `PI`, `setbits`, `sz`, and `all` are defined but not used in the code. Remove these macros to improve code readability.

5. Remove unnecessary debug statements: The `_print` functions and the `bug` macro are used for debugging purposes. Remove these statements as they are not required for the final optimized code.

6. Optimize the `g()` function: The `g()` function calculates the number of digits in a given number `n`. However, the current implementation uses a while loop and repeatedly divides `n` by 10 until `n` becomes 0. This approach has a time complexity of O(log n) and can be optimized to O(1) by using the logarithmic property of base 10.

7. Optimize the `solve()` function: The `solve()` function uses two while loops to find the numbers `i` and `j` that satisfy the conditions. However, these loops can be optimized by using a mathematical approach. The number `i` can be obtained by multiplying `x` by 2 raised to the power of `a - c`, and the number `j` can be obtained by multiplying `x` by 5 raised to the power of `b - c`. This approach eliminates the need for the while loops and improves the overall efficiency of the code.
