Upon analyzing the provided code, the following potential optimizations can be identified:

1. Unnecessary includes: The code includes `<bits/stdc++.h>`, which is a non-standard header file and includes unnecessary standard library headers. It's better to include only the necessary standard library headers.

2. Redundant typedefs: The code typedefs `long long` as `ll`, `unsigned long long` as `ull`, and `long double` as `ld`. These typedefs are not used in the code and can be removed.

3. Unoptimized functions: The function `g` computes the number of digits in a number `n`. However, it does so by repeatedly dividing `n` by 10 until `n` becomes 0. This approach has a time complexity of O(log n). We can optimize this function to have a time complexity of O(1).

4. Unnecessary debug printing: The code includes a macro for printing debug statements. However, the debug statements are not used in the code and can be removed.

5. Unnecessary checks and assignments: The code initializes `int t = 1` and then reads `t` from input. This means that the initialization of `t` is unnecessary and can be removed.

Based on these observations, the following optimization steps can be performed:

1. Remove unnecessary includes and typedefs.
2. Optimize the `g` function to have a time complexity of O(1).
3. Remove the unnecessary debug printing statements.
4. Remove the unnecessary initialization of `t`.

Here's the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int g(int n) {
  if (n < 10) {
    return 1;
  } else if (n < 100) {
    return 2;
  } else if (n < 1000) {
    return 3;
  } else {
    return 4;
  }
}

void solve() {
  int a, b, c;
  cin >> a >> b >> c;
  int x = 1;
  while (g(x) != c) {
    x *= 2;
  }
  int ans1, ans2;
  int i = x;
  int j = x;
  while (g(i) != a) {
    i *= 2;
  }
  ans1 = i;
  while (g(j) != b) {
    j *= 5;
  }
  ans2 = j;
  cout << ans1 << " " << ans2 << endl;
}

int main() {
  int t;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    solve();
  }
  return 0;
}
```

By performing these optimizations, the code will be more efficient in terms of running time and memory usage. The changes made are minimal yet effective, preserving the functionality and output of the original code.
