The given code appears to be a solution to a programming problem that involves finding two numbers based on certain conditions. However, the code includes several inefficiencies and areas for improvement. Let's analyze the code step by step and propose optimizations where necessary.

1. Inefficient Data Structures:
   - The code includes unnecessary header files (`<bits/stdc++.h>`) that are not needed for the current code. We should include only the necessary header files to reduce compilation time and improve efficiency.
   - The code uses `vector`, `set`, and `map` data structures, which might not be necessary for this specific problem. We should consider using more efficient data structures or eliminate their usage altogether if not required.

2. Redundant Computations:
   - The `g` function is called multiple times in the code, and it performs redundant computations. The function calculates the number of digits in a given number by repeatedly dividing it by 10. We can optimize this function to directly calculate the number of digits without using a loop.

3. Inefficient Loop:
   - In the `solve` function, there is a while loop that calculates the value of `x` based on the condition `g(x) != c`. This loop can be optimized to improve efficiency.

4. Unnecessary Variable Initialization:
   - The variable `t` is initialized with a value of 1, but it is immediately overwritten with the value read from input. We can remove the initial assignment and directly read the value from input.

Based on these observations, let's proceed with the optimization steps:

1. Remove unnecessary header files.
2. Optimize the `g` function to calculate the number of digits using logarithms.
3. Optimize the `solve` function by removing the inefficient while loop and using a direct calculation for `x`.
4. Remove the unnecessary variable initialization of `t`.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>
using namespace std;

int g(int n) {
  return floor(log10(n) + 1);
}

void solve() {
  int a, b, c;
  cin >> a >> b >> c;
  
  int x = pow(10, c - 1);
  int ans1 = pow(10, a - 1);
  int ans2 = pow(10, b - 1) * 5;
  
  cout << ans1 << " " << ans2 << endl;
}

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(nullptr);
  cout.tie(nullptr);

  int t;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    solve();
  }

  return 0;
}
```

In this optimized code, we have made the following changes:

1. Removed unnecessary header files.
2. Optimized the `g` function to calculate the number of digits using logarithms instead of a loop.
3. Optimized the `solve` function by directly calculating `x`, `ans1`, and `ans2` using mathematical operations.
4. Removed the unnecessary variable initialization of `t`.

These optimizations should improve the efficiency of the code by reducing unnecessary computations and using more efficient calculations.
