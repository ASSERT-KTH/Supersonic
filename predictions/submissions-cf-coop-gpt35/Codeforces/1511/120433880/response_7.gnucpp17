The given code appears to be a solution to a programming problem. It reads input integers `a`, `b`, and `c` and then performs a series of calculations to find two integers `ans1` and `ans2`. Finally, it prints `ans1` and `ans2` to the output.

Upon analyzing the code, the following potential optimizations can be identified:

1. Unnecessary imports: The line `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` includes the entire C++ standard library, which is unnecessary for this code. Only the required headers should be included to minimize compilation time and memory usage.

2. Redundant type definitions: The type definitions `ll`, `ull`, and `ld` are defined but not used in the code. They can be removed to reduce the code clutter.

3. Redundant macros: The macros `INF`, `pb`, `pob`, `ff`, `ss`, `PI`, `setbits`, `sz`, and `all` are defined but not used in the code. They can be removed to improve code readability.

4. Redundant print functions: The `_print` functions are defined but not used in the code. They can be removed to reduce code complexity.

5. Inefficient loop in function `g()`: The loop in function `g()` is inefficient as it divides `n` by 10 in each iteration until `n` becomes 0. This can be optimized by using logarithmic operations instead of repeated divisions.

6. Redundant loop in function `solve()`: The loop in function `solve()` uses the `g()` function to check the number of digits of `x` in each iteration until it matches `c`. However, since `x` is multiplied by 2 in each iteration, the number of digits of `x` will always increase. Therefore, the loop can be optimized by using a logarithmic operation instead of calling `g()` repeatedly.

7. Redundant loop variables in function `solve()`: The loop variables `i` and `j` in function `solve()` are initialized with `x` and then multiplied by 2 and 5, respectively, until the number of digits matches `a` and `b`. However, since `x` is already set based on `c`, the loop variables `i` and `j` can be initialized with `x` directly without the need for the additional loops.

Based on these observations, the following optimization strategy can be formulated:

1. Remove unnecessary imports, type definitions, macros, and print functions to reduce code clutter.

2. Replace the inefficient loop in function `g()` with a logarithmic operation to calculate the number of digits.

3. Optimize the loop in function `solve()` by using a logarithmic operation instead of calling `g()` repeatedly.

4. Initialize the loop variables `i` and `j` in function `solve()` with `x` directly, removing the need for additional loops.
