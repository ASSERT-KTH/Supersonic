After analyzing the given code, I have identified a few potential areas for optimization:

1. Unnecessary includes: The code includes the entire standard library (`<bits/stdc++.h>`), which can lead to increased compilation time and unnecessary memory usage. We can include only the required headers for this program.

2. Redundant function calls: The `g()` function is called multiple times in the `solve()` function. However, the value returned by this function does not change during the execution of the `solve()` function. We can calculate the value of `g(x)` once and store it in a variable before the loop to avoid redundant function calls.

3. Redundant variable assignments: The variables `ans1` and `ans2` are assigned values inside the loop, but their values are not updated during subsequent iterations of the loop. We can move these assignments outside the loop to avoid unnecessary repeated assignments.

4. Unnecessary variable initialization: The variable `t` is initialized to 1 before reading the input value. However, the input value will overwrite this initialization. We can remove this unnecessary initialization.

5. Function calls in loop conditions: The loop conditions `while (g(x) != c)`, `while (g(i) != a)`, and `while (g(j) != b)` involve function calls. These function calls can be expensive if the loop iterates many times. We can calculate the values of `g(x)`, `g(i)`, and `g(j)` before the loop and store them in variables.

6. Code formatting: The code could be formatted in a more consistent and readable style to improve its understandability.
