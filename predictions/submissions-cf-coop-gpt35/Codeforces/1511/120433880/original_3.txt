Code Analysis:
- The code seems to be a part of a larger program that solves a specific problem. However, the problem statement is not provided, so we will focus on optimizing the given code block.
- The code includes several unnecessary header files, such as `<bits/stdc++.h>`, which is not a standard C++ header file and is known to slow down compilation.
- The code defines several unnecessary type aliases (`typedef`) for `long long`, `unsigned long long`, and `long double`. These aliases are not used in the code and can be removed.
- The code includes a lot of unnecessary macros, such as `fast`, `INF`, `pb`, `pob`, `ff`, `ss`, `PI`, `setbits`, `sz`, `all`, and `bug`. These macros are not used in the code and can be removed.
- The `_print` functions and related template functions are used for debugging purposes and are not needed for the final optimized code. These functions can be removed.
- The `g` function calculates the number of digits in a number by repeatedly dividing it by 10 until it becomes zero. This function can be optimized to use logarithmic operations instead of repeated division.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Remove unnecessary header files.
2. Remove unnecessary type aliases.
3. Remove unnecessary macros.
4. Optimize the `g` function to use logarithmic operations instead of repeated division.
5. Remove the unused debugging functions.
6. Check if there are any other optimizations that can be done in the `solve` function.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Remove unnecessary header files:
   - The `<bits/stdc++.h>` header file includes all standard C++ header files. However, it is not a standard header file and can slow down compilation. We can replace it with the specific header files that are actually used in the code.
   - Remove the line `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` and add the following header files instead:
     ```cpp
     #include <iostream>
     #include <vector>
     #include <set>
     #include <map>
     #include <algorithm>
     ```
2. Remove unnecessary type aliases:
   - Remove the type aliases `typedef long long ll;`, `typedef unsigned long long ull;`, and `typedef long double ld;` as they are not used in the code.
3. Remove unnecessary macros:
   - Remove the macros `#define fast ...`, `#define INF 1e18`, `#define pb push_back`, `#define pob pop_back`, `#define ff first`, `#define ss second`, `#define PI 3.141592653589793238462`, `#define setbits __builtin_popcountll`, `#define sz(x) ((int)(x).size())`, `#define all(x) (x).begin(), (x).end()`, and `#ifndef ONLINE_JUDGE #define bug(x) ... #else #define bug(x) #endif` as they are not used in the code.
4. Optimize the `g` function:
   - The `g` function calculates the number of digits in a number by repeatedly dividing it by 10 until it becomes zero. This can be optimized by using logarithmic operations.
   - Replace the `g` function with the following optimized version:
     ```cpp
     int g(int n) {
       return static_cast<int>(std::log10(n)) + 1;
     }
     ```
5. Remove the unused debugging functions:
   - Remove the `_print` functions and the related template functions as they are not used in the code.
6. Check for other optimizations in the `solve` function:
   - The `solve` function reads input values for `a`, `b`, and `c` and then calculates `ans1` and `ans2` based on these values.
   - There are no obvious optimizations that can be done in the `solve` function.

Optimized Code Block:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <set>
#include <map>
#include <algorithm>
#include <cmath>

int g(int n) {
  return static_cast<int>(std::log10(n)) + 1;
}

void solve() {
  int a, b, c;
  std::cin >> a >> b >> c;
  int x = 1;
  while (g(x) != c) {
    x *= 2;
  }
  int ans1, ans2;
  int i = x;
  int j = x;
  while (g(i) != a) {
    i *= 2;
  }
  ans1 = i;
  while (g(j) != b) {
    j *= 5;
  }
  ans2 = j;
  std::cout << ans1 << " " << ans2 << std::endl;
}

int main() {
  int t = 1;
  std::cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    solve();
  }
  return 0;
}
```
