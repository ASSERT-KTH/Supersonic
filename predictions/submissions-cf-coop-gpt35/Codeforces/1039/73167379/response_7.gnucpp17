The given code appears to be solving a graph problem related to finding the maximum number of nodes in a subtree with a given diameter. However, the code is quite complex and not easily understandable due to the lack of meaningful variable names, excessive use of macros, and unnecessary optimizations.

To optimize the code, we can focus on the following areas:

1. Reducing memory usage:
   - Replace unnecessary macros with meaningful variable names.
   - Remove unnecessary data structures like `multiset`, `pair`, and `deque`.
   - Simplify the graph representation by using a simple adjacency list instead of a vector of vectors.
   - Remove unnecessary global variables.

2. Improving code readability and maintainability:
   - Replace complex and unreadable variable names with meaningful names.
   - Remove unnecessary comments and code blocks.
   - Simplify the logic by removing redundant calculations and loops.
   - Use standard C++ features and libraries instead of custom implementations.

3. Optimizing runtime performance:
   - Identify bottlenecks and optimize the critical functions (`CALC()` and `GA()`).
   - Avoid unnecessary calculations and redundant operations.
   - Utilize compiler optimizations and pragmas to hint the compiler for better optimization.
