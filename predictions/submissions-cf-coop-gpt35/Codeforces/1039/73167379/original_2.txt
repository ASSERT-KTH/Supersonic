The given code is a C++ program that aims to optimize the calculation of the maximum diameter of a tree. The program reads an integer `a` and a set of edges representing a tree. It then calculates the diameter of the tree for each possible length from 1 to `a` and outputs the result.

Upon analyzing the code, several potential areas for optimization can be identified:

1. Redundant Memory Usage: The code uses multiple data structures such as vectors, sets, and maps, which may introduce unnecessary memory overhead. It is possible to optimize the data structures used to reduce memory usage.

2. Unnecessary Computations: The code performs some redundant calculations, such as recalculating the size and depth of each node multiple times. These calculations can be optimized to avoid repetitive work.

3. Inefficient Algorithms: The code uses recursive functions and nested loops, which can be optimized to improve performance. Loop unrolling and tail recursion optimization techniques can be applied to reduce the number of iterations.

4. Compiler Optimizations: The code includes compiler pragmas and directives that suggest optimizations to the compiler. These directives can be analyzed and potentially modified to further improve the performance of the code.

Based on these observations, the following optimization strategy can be formulated:

1. Replace the unnecessary data structures with more efficient alternatives to reduce memory usage.

2. Optimize the calculation of node size and depth to avoid redundant computations.

3. Apply loop unrolling and tail recursion optimization techniques to reduce the number of iterations.

4. Analyze the compiler pragmas and directives to determine their effectiveness and modify them if needed.

Now, let's proceed with the step-by-step explanation of each optimization step and provide the optimized code.
