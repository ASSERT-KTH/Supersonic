The given code appears to be a program that calculates and prints the maximum number of vertices in a subtree of a given tree that form a path of length at most `i` for each `i` from 1 to `a`, where `a` is the number of vertices in the tree.

Upon analyzing the code, the following potential performance bottlenecks and areas for optimization can be identified:

1. Excessive use of `std` namespace: The code includes a `using namespace std` statement, which brings all the names from the `std` namespace into the current scope. This can lead to naming conflicts and slower compilation times. It is better to avoid this practice and use explicit namespace qualifiers instead.

2. Excessive use of macros: The code uses macros for defining common operations and data structures, such as `vector`, `multiset`, etc. While macros can be useful for code readability and brevity, excessive use of macros can make the code harder to understand and debug. It is better to use explicit function and class definitions instead of macros.

3. Use of global variables: The code uses global variables extensively, which can make the code harder to understand and maintain. It is generally better to encapsulate variables within functions and classes to improve code modularity and readability.

4. Inefficient data structures: The code uses `vector` and `deque` for storing and manipulating the tree structure. While these data structures are generally efficient, there may be opportunities to optimize memory usage and improve performance by using more appropriate data structures.

5. Redundant calculations: The code performs some calculations multiple times, resulting in unnecessary computation. These redundant calculations can be eliminated to improve performance.

6. Inefficient memory allocation: The code uses dynamic memory allocation for certain arrays, but it does not release the memory after use. This can lead to memory leaks and inefficient memory usage.

7. Recursive function calls: The code uses recursive function calls for tree traversal, which can be inefficient for large trees. It may be possible to optimize these recursive calls using techniques such as loop unrolling or tail recursion.

Based on the above analysis, the following optimization strategy can be formulated:

1. Remove the unnecessary `using namespace std` statement and replace it with explicit namespace qualifiers.

2. Replace macros with explicit function and class definitions.

3. Encapsulate global variables within functions and classes.

4. Analyze the use of data structures and identify opportunities for optimization.

5. Identify and eliminate redundant calculations.

6. Optimize memory allocation by releasing memory after use.

7. Analyze and optimize recursive function calls if necessary.

8. Consider additional compiler optimizations or pragma directives to hint the compiler for further optimization.
