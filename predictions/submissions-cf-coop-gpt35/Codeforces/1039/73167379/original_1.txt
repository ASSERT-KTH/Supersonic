Before diving into the optimization strategy, let's analyze the provided code and identify potential areas for improvement:

1. The code includes a large number of unnecessary header inclusions, such as `<bits/stdc++.h>`, which can significantly slow down the compilation process. It is best to include only the necessary headers for the specific functionality used in the code.

2. The use of `using namespace std;` is generally not recommended as it can lead to naming conflicts and make the code harder to understand. It is better to explicitly specify the namespace for each identifier used.

3. The code uses a number of macros (`#define`) to define aliases for certain types or functions. While this can save some typing, it can also make the code less readable, especially for other developers who are not familiar with the codebase.

4. The code includes a number of unused variables and functions, such as `rnd`, `PRINT`, and `FILE`. These should be removed to reduce clutter and improve code readability.

5. The code uses a custom input/output mechanism with functions like `getChar`, `putChar`, `printInt`, and `ni`. This custom mechanism may have been introduced to optimize the input/output operations, but it adds unnecessary complexity to the code. It is better to use standard input/output functions like `cin` and `cout` for simplicity and readability.

6. The code uses global variables extensively, which can lead to potential bugs and make the code harder to reason about. It is recommended to encapsulate the data and functionality within appropriate classes or functions.

7. The code contains a number of loops and recursive calls that could potentially be optimized. For example, the `CALC` function uses recursion to calculate the depth of each node in the tree. This recursion can be optimized by using an iterative approach or by using memoization to avoid redundant calculations.

8. The code uses multiple nested loops for various calculations, such as finding the centroid and calculating the maximum depth. These loops can be optimized by using more efficient algorithms or data structures.

9. The code has a number of unnecessary or redundant computations. For example, the `GA` function recalculates the same values multiple times, leading to inefficient computation.

Now that we have identified potential areas for optimization, let's formulate an optimization strategy to improve the performance and efficiency of the code.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Remove unnecessary header inclusions: Eliminate unnecessary header inclusions, such as `<bits/stdc++.h>`, and include only the necessary headers for the specific functionality used in the code.

2. Remove unused variables and functions: Remove unused variables and functions, such as `rnd`, `PRINT`, and `FILE`, to reduce clutter and improve code readability.

3. Replace macros with explicit definitions: Replace macros like `#define` with explicit definitions to improve code readability and avoid potential issues with naming conflicts. For example, replace `#define F first` with `typedef pair<ll, ll> pll;`.

4. Replace custom input/output mechanism: Replace the custom input/output mechanism with standard input/output functions like `cin` and `cout` for simplicity and readability.

5. Encapsulate data and functionality: Encapsulate the data and functionality within appropriate classes or functions to reduce the use of global variables and improve code organization.

6. Optimize recursive calculations: Optimize recursive calculations, such as the `CALC` function, by using an iterative approach or by using memoization to avoid redundant calculations.

7. Optimize nested loops: Optimize nested loops, such as finding the centroid and calculating the maximum depth, by using more efficient algorithms or data structures.

8. Avoid redundant computations: Avoid redundant computations by storing and reusing previously calculated values instead of recalculating them multiple times.

Now let's go step-by-step and optimize the code accordingly.
