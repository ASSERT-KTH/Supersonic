To optimize the given code, we can focus on the following areas:

1. Data Structures: The current code uses several data structures like vectors, deques, multisets, and unordered maps/sets. While these data structures are convenient to use, they may not be the most efficient choice for performance. We can consider using more efficient alternatives like arrays, linked lists, or hash maps.

2. Recursion and Loops: The code uses recursion and loops extensively. We can analyze these sections to identify any opportunities for optimization, such as loop unrolling or tail recursion.

3. Redundant Computations: There might be redundant or unnecessary computations in the code that can be eliminated to improve performance. We need to identify and remove such computations.

4. Compiler Optimizations: We can make use of compiler optimizations and pragma directives to hint the compiler to optimize certain parts of the code.

Now, let's go through each optimization step in detail:

1. Data Structures:
   - Replace the `vec` (vector) data structure with a more efficient alternative like an array or linked list. Vectors have a dynamic size and can cause frequent reallocations, which can impact performance.
   - Replace the `ms` (multiset) data structure with a more efficient alternative like a sorted array or a binary search tree. Multisets maintain elements in a sorted order, but this sorting adds overhead to insertions and deletions.
   - Replace the `umap` (unordered_map) and `uset` (unordered_set) data structures with more efficient hash maps or hash sets. Unordered maps and sets use hash functions to store and retrieve elements, which can be slower than their ordered counterparts in some cases.

2. Recursion and Loops:
   - Analyze the `CALC` function, which uses recursion to calculate the maximum depth of each node in the tree. Consider optimizing this function by using an iterative approach instead of recursion.
   - Analyze the `KROLIK` and `RIP_PAPA` functions, which use recursion to mark nodes as either good or bad. Consider optimizing these functions by using an iterative approach or tail recursion.
   - Analyze the loop in the `RIP_PAPA` function that searches for the parent node to remove from the child's adjacency list. Consider using more efficient data structures or algorithms to find the parent node without iterating over the entire list.

3. Redundant Computations:
   - Analyze the `GA` function, which computes the number of groups of size `LEN` that can be formed from the given tree. Look for opportunities to eliminate redundant computations by storing intermediate results in an array or memoizing the function.
   - Analyze the loop in the `main` function that initializes the `o` array with `-1` values. Consider initializing the array with a single loop instead of using `memset` to set all values.

4. Compiler Optimizations:
   - The code already includes compiler optimization pragmas like `#pragma optimization_level 3`, `#pragma GCC optimize("Ofast")`, and `#pragma GCC target("avx,avx2,fma")`. These pragmas hint the compiler to optimize the code for speed and use specific processor features. Ensure that the code is compiled with the appropriate compiler flags to enable optimization.
