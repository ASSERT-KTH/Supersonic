The given code appears to be solving a problem that involves finding the maximum number of items that can be selected from an array such that their sum does not exceed a given value. The code reads the input, sorts the array, and then iterates over all possible starting positions to calculate the maximum count of items that can be selected.

To optimize this code, we can focus on the following areas:

1. Unnecessary includes: The code includes several unnecessary header files like `<bitset>`, `<cmath>`, `<cstdio>`, `<cstring>`, `<iostream>`, `<map>`, `<queue>`, `<set>`, `<stack>`, `<string>`, `<time.h>`, `<unordered_map>`, `<unordered_set>`, and `<vector>`. Since these headers are not being used in the code, we can remove them to reduce compilation time.

2. Unnecessary macros: The code defines several macros like `ll`, `LINF`, `INF`, `PI`, `RAND`, `MAX`, `MIN`, `ABS`, and `CEIL`. These macros are not used in the code and can be safely removed.

3. Inefficient sorting: The code uses the `std::sort` function to sort the array `A`. However, since we only need to find the maximum count of items, we don't need to sort the entire array. We can optimize this by using a partial sort algorithm like `std::partial_sort` to sort only the first `K` items.

4. Inefficient prefix sum calculation: The code calculates the prefix sum array `psum` using a loop. However, we can optimize this by using the `std::partial_sum` function to calculate the prefix sum in a single pass.

5. Inefficient loop structure: The code uses a nested loop structure to iterate over all possible starting positions and calls the `func` function for each position. However, we can optimize this by using a single loop and updating the maximum count directly.

Here is the optimized code with explanations for each optimization step:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <cstdio>

const int MAXN = 2e5 + 5;

int N, M, K;
int A[MAXN];
int psum[MAXN];

int func(int pos) {
  if (psum[pos] > M)
    return 0;
  int temp = M - psum[pos];
  int cnt = pos;
  for (int i = pos + K; i <= N; i += K) {
    if (A[i] > temp) {
      for (int j = i - K + 1; j <= N; ++j) {
        if (A[j] <= temp) {
          temp -= A[j];
          ++cnt;
        } else
          break;
      }
      break;
    } else {
      temp -= A[i];
      cnt += K;
    }
  }
  return cnt;
}

void solve(int testNum) {
  scanf("%d%d%d", &N, &M, &K);
  for (int i = 1; i <= N; ++i) {
    scanf("%d", &A[i]);
  }

  std::partial_sort(A + 1, A + 1 + K, A + 1 + N);
  std::partial_sum(A, A + 1 + K, psum);

  if (psum[K] <= M) {
    printf("%d\n", N);
    return;
  }

  int cnt = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i <= N; i += K) {
    cnt = std::max(cnt, func(i));
  }

  printf("%d\n", cnt);
}

int main() {
  int T;
  scanf("%d", &T);
  for (int t = 1; t <= T; ++t) {
    solve(t);
  }
  return 0;
}
```

By making the above optimizations, we have simplified the code and reduced unnecessary operations. This should result in improved performance and reduced memory usage.
