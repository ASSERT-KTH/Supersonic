The given code calculates the maximum number of elements that can be selected from an array `A` such that the sum of those elements is less than or equal to `M`, and the selected elements are at least `K` positions apart. The code uses a brute force approach to iterate through all possible starting positions and calls the function `func` to calculate the count of elements that can be selected from that position.

To optimize this code, we can focus on the following areas:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The code includes several unnecessary header files such as `<bitset>`, `<cmath>`, `<cstdio>`, `<cstring>`, `<iostream>`, `<map>`, `<queue>`, `<set>`, `<stack>`, `<string>`, `<time.h>`, `<unordered_map>`, `<unordered_set>`, and `<vector>`. These should be removed as they are not used in the code.

2. Avoid using macros for simple operations: The code defines macros for simple operations like finding the maximum, minimum, and absolute value. Using macros can lead to unexpected behavior and make code harder to read and debug. Instead, we can use inline functions or regular functions for these operations.

3. Avoid unnecessary sorting: The code sorts the array `A` before calculating the prefix sum. However, sorting is not necessary for this problem as we are only interested in the prefix sum. We can remove the sorting step to improve performance.

4. Optimize the `func` function: The `func` function can be optimized to reduce the number of iterations and unnecessary comparisons. Instead of iterating through every `K`-th element, we can directly calculate the count by dividing the remaining sum `temp` by the minimum element `A[i]` in the remaining subarray. This will reduce the number of iterations and comparisons in the loop.

5. Remove unnecessary loop in `solve` function: The `solve` function unnecessarily iterates from 0 to `N` and calls `func(i)` for each iteration. This can be avoided by initializing `cnt` to 0 and updating it directly in the loop where we calculate the prefix sum.
