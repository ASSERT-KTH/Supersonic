## Code Analysis

Upon analyzing the given code, the following potential performance bottlenecks and inefficient memory usage are identified:

1. Inefficient sorting: The code sorts the array `A` using `std::sort` in each test case. This sorting operation has a time complexity of O(N log N), which can be costly for large arrays.

2. Redundant prefix sum calculation: The code calculates the prefix sum of the array `A` using the `psum` array. However, this prefix sum is only used to check if the sum of all elements is less than or equal to `M`. This check can be performed without explicitly calculating the prefix sum.

3. Inefficient loop: The `func` function contains a loop that iterates over the array `A` by incrementing `i` by `K` in each iteration. This loop can be optimized to avoid unnecessary iterations.

4. Lack of compiler optimizations: The code does not utilize any compiler optimizations or pragma directives to hint the compiler to optimize certain parts of the code.

## Optimization Strategy

Based on the code analysis, the following optimization strategy can be formulated:

1. Replace the sorting operation with a linear time counting sort since the array `A` contains non-negative integers.

2. Eliminate the explicit calculation of the prefix sum and instead check if the sum of all elements is less than or equal to `M` during the input reading loop.

3. Optimize the `func` function to avoid unnecessary iterations. Instead of iterating by `K` in each iteration, find the next index `i` where `A[i]` is greater than `temp` and iterate backwards to find the index `j` where `A[j]` is less than or equal to `temp`. This way, we can avoid iterating over all elements in each iteration.

4. Add compiler optimizations or pragma directives to hint the compiler to optimize the code further.

## Step-by-Step Explanation

1. Replace the sorting operation with counting sort:
   - Since the array `A` contains non-negative integers, we can use counting sort to sort the array in linear time.
   - Create a count array `count` of size `MAXN` to store the count of each element.
   - Iterate over the array `A` and increment the count of each element in the `count` array.
   - Update the array `A` by iterating over the `count` array and assigning the elements back to `A`.
   - This replaces the sorting operation with a linear time counting sort.

2. Eliminate the explicit calculation of the prefix sum:
   - Instead of calculating the prefix sum explicitly, we can check if the sum of all elements is less than or equal to `M` during the input reading loop.
   - Keep a running sum variable `sum` initialized to 0.
   - After reading each element of `A`, add it to `sum`.
   - If `sum` becomes greater than `M`, break out of the loop.

3. Optimize the `func` function:
   - Replace the loop inside the `func` function with a more efficient approach.
   - Initialize `temp` as `M - psum[pos]`.
   - Find the next index `i` where `A[i]` is greater than `temp`.
   - Iterate backwards from `i - K + 1` to find the index `j` where `A[j]` is less than or equal to `temp`.
   - Update `temp` by subtracting `A[j]` and increment `cnt`.
   - Break out of the loop if `A[j]` is greater than `temp`.

4. Add compiler optimizations or pragma directives:
   - Add compiler optimizations to hint the compiler to optimize the code further.
   - Use the `-O3` flag to enable aggressive optimizations.
   - Use the `#pragma GCC optimize` directive to enable specific optimizations, such as loop unrolling or vectorization.
