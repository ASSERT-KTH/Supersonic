Upon analyzing the given code, I have identified several potential optimizations:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: The code includes several unnecessary header files that are not used in the program. These include `<bitset>`, `<cmath>`, `<cstdio>`, `<cstring>`, `<iostream>`, `<map>`, `<queue>`, `<set>`, `<stack>`, `<string>`, `<time.h>`, `<unordered_map>`, `<unordered_set>`, and `<vector>`. Removing these includes will improve compile time.

2. Remove unused macros: The code defines several macros that are not used in the program. These macros include `LINF`, `INF`, `PI`, `RAND`, `MAX`, `MIN`, `ABS`, and `CEIL`. Removing these macros will improve code readability.

3. Optimize the `func` function: The `func` function can be optimized by removing unnecessary checks and loops. Specifically, the inner loop that checks for `A[j] <= temp` can be replaced with a binary search to find the first element greater than `temp`. This will significantly reduce the number of iterations in the loop. Additionally, the loop `for (int i = pos + K; i <= N; i += K)` can be optimized by starting the loop at `i = pos + (temp / A[i]) * K` instead of `i = pos + K`. This will skip unnecessary iterations when `A[i]` is smaller than `temp`.

4. Optimize the main loop: The main loop that iterates over `i` in the `solve` function can be optimized by starting the loop at `i = 1` instead of `i = 0`. This is because `func` is called with `pos = i`, and `func` already handles the case when `psum[pos] > M`. Starting the loop at `i = 1` will eliminate unnecessary iterations.

Based on these optimizations, here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <cstdio>

const int MAXN = 2e5 + 5;
int N, M, K;
int A[MAXN];
int psum[MAXN];

int func(int pos) {
  if (psum[pos] > M)
    return 0;
  int temp = M - psum[pos];
  int cnt = pos;
  int i = pos + K;
  while (i <= N) {
    if (A[i] > temp) {
      int low = pos + 1;
      int high = i - K;
      while (low <= high) {
        int mid = (low + high) / 2;
        if (A[mid] <= temp)
          low = mid + 1;
        else
          high = mid - 1;
      }
      cnt += (high - pos + 1);
      break;
    } else {
      temp -= A[i];
      cnt += K;
      i += K;
    }
  }
  return cnt;
}

void solve(int testNum) {
  int i;
  scanf("%d%d%d", &N, &M, &K);
  for (i = 1; i <= N; ++i) {
    scanf("%d", &A[i]);
  }
  std::sort(A + 1, A + 1 + N);
  for (i = 1; i <= N; ++i)
    psum[i] = psum[i - 1] + A[i];
  if (psum[N] <= M) {
    printf("%d\n", N);
    return;
  }
  int cnt = 0;
  for (i = 1; i <= N; ++i) {
    cnt = std::max(cnt, func(i));
  }
  printf("%d\n", cnt);
}

int main() {
  int T;
  scanf("%d", &T);
  for (int t = 1; t <= T; ++t) {
    solve(t);
  }
  return 0;
}
```

These optimizations will improve the performance of the code by reducing unnecessary computations and improving code readability.
