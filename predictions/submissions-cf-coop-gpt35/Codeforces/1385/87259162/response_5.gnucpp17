Upon analyzing the provided code, I have identified several potential optimizations:

1. Remove unnecessary headers: The code includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header, which is not recommended as it includes all standard library headers and can increase compilation time. Instead, we should include only the necessary headers.

2. Replace macros with inline functions: The code uses macros for some common operations, such as printing arrays and inserting elements into vectors. Macros can lead to unexpected behavior and are not type-safe. We should replace these macros with inline functions.

3. Optimize input/output functions: The code uses custom input/output functions (`is`, `lis`, `ss`, `ws`, `ip`, `lip`, `stp`) for faster I/O. However, these functions use `getchar` and `putchar`, which can be slow. We can replace these functions with the standard `cin` and `cout` for faster I/O.

4. Use `reserve()` for vectors: The code creates vectors `g`, `directed_edges`, `undirected_edges`, and `ts` without specifying their initial capacity. This can lead to frequent reallocations and memory copies. We can use the `reserve()` function to allocate memory in advance.

5. Avoid unnecessary copying: The code unnecessarily copies the elements of `directed_edges` and `undirected_edges` when iterating over them. We can use references instead of copies to avoid this overhead.

6. Use a `bool` array instead of `vector<bool>`: The code uses a `vector<bool>` for the `visited` array. However, `vector<bool>` is a specialized container that can be inefficient due to its space-saving representation. We can use a simple `bool` array instead.

7. Use a `vector<int>` instead of dynamically allocated array: The code dynamically allocates memory for the `topo_order` array using `calloc()`. We can use a `vector<int>` instead, which provides automatic memory management and better safety.

8. Avoid unnecessary memory deallocation: The code uses `free()` to deallocate the memory of the `topo_order` array. Since we are using a `vector<int>` instead, we don't need to manually deallocate memory.
