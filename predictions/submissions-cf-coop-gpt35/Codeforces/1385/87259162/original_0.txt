Analysis:
1. The code includes unnecessary header files (`<bits/stdc++.h>`) that can increase compilation time and result in larger executable files. It is recommended to include only the necessary header files.
2. The code uses macros for loop constructs (`FORb` and `FORe`). These macros can be replaced with standard loop constructs for better readability and maintainability.
3. The code includes redundant functions for reading integers (`is`, `lis`) and strings (`ss`, `ws`). These functions can be replaced with standard library functions for better performance.
4. The code uses global variables for storing graph information (`g`, `directed_edges`, `undirected_edges`, `ts`, `topo_order`, `possible`). It is recommended to encapsulate these variables within a class or a struct to improve code organization and reduce the scope of variables.
5. The code uses dynamic memory allocation (`calloc`) to allocate memory for `topo_order`. This can be replaced with a std::vector for better memory management and exception safety.
6. The code uses a recursive depth-first search (DFS) algorithm to compute the topological order of nodes in the graph. This recursive approach can lead to stack overflow for large input sizes. It is recommended to implement an iterative DFS or use a stack data structure to avoid stack overflow.
7. The code checks if a directed edge violates the topological order by comparing the topological order values of the source and destination nodes. This can be optimized by using a std::unordered_map or std::unordered_set to store the topological order of each node for constant time lookup.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Remove unnecessary header files and replace them with the necessary ones.
2. Replace the macros for loop constructs with standard loop constructs.
3. Replace the custom input functions (`is`, `lis`, `ss`, `ws`) with standard library functions (`scanf`, `fgets`).
4. Encapsulate graph-related variables within a struct or a class to improve code organization.
5. Replace dynamic memory allocation with std::vector for better memory management.
6. Replace the recursive DFS algorithm with an iterative DFS or stack-based DFS.
7. Use a std::unordered_set to store the topological order of each node for efficient lookup.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Remove unnecessary header files and replace them with the necessary ones. The `bits/stdc++.h` header file is not necessary and can be replaced with the specific header files that are needed. In this case, the required header files are `<iostream>`, `<vector>`, `<unordered_map>`, and `<algorithm>`.
2. Replace the macros for loop constructs with standard loop constructs. The macros `FORb` and `FORe` can be replaced with standard `for` loops.
3. Replace the custom input functions (`is`, `lis`, `ss`, `ws`) with standard library functions (`scanf`, `fgets`). This will improve performance by avoiding unnecessary function calls and reducing the complexity of the code.
4. Encapsulate graph-related variables within a struct or a class to improve code organization. This will make the code more readable and maintainable.
5. Replace dynamic memory allocation with std::vector for better memory management. Instead of using `calloc` to allocate memory for `topo_order`, use a std::vector<int> to store the topological order values. This will simplify memory management and improve exception safety.
6. Replace the recursive DFS algorithm with an iterative DFS or stack-based DFS. This will prevent stack overflow for large input sizes. The DFS function can be implemented using a stack data structure instead of recursion.
7. Use a std::unordered_set to store the topological order of each node for efficient lookup. Instead of checking the topological order values of nodes using a loop, store the topological order values in a std::unordered_set. This will allow constant time lookup for checking if a directed edge violates the topological order.
