The given code appears to be an implementation of a graph problem. Here are some potential optimizations that can be made:

1. Avoid unnecessary includes: The code includes several unnecessary headers, such as `<bits/stdc++.h>` and `<ext/pb_ds/assoc_container.hpp>`. These headers may include a large number of standard library headers, which can slow down the compilation time. It is recommended to include only the necessary headers.

2. Avoid using `using namespace std;`: While it may be convenient to use `using namespace std;`, it is considered a bad practice as it pollutes the global namespace and can lead to naming conflicts. Instead, use the `std::` prefix for standard library types and functions.

3. Avoid unnecessary data structures: The code defines two custom data structures `ordered_set` and `ordered_multiset` using the `tree` template from the `__gnu_pbds` library. However, these data structures are not used in the code. Remove these definitions to reduce unnecessary code and potential overhead.

4. Avoid unnecessary macros: The code defines several macros, such as `fastio`, `int`, `ld`, `MOD`, etc. Some of these macros are not used in the code. Remove the unused macros to simplify the code.

5. Use `reserve` to allocate memory: The code initializes several vectors, such as `visited`, `being_visited`, and `TS`, with a size of `n + 1`. However, the exact size of these vectors is known in advance. Use the `reserve` function to preallocate memory for these vectors, instead of relying on dynamic resizing.

6. Use range-based `for` loop: The code uses a traditional `for` loop with an index variable to iterate over the elements of a vector. Prefer using range-based `for` loops, which provide a cleaner and more concise syntax.

7. Optimize cycle detection: The code uses a recursive depth-first search (DFS) algorithm to detect cycles in the graph. However, this approach can be improved by using an iterative DFS algorithm or an algorithm specifically designed for cycle detection, such as Tarjan's algorithm.

8. Avoid unnecessary copying: The code makes unnecessary copies of vectors, such as `g[i]` and `G[i]`, when checking for certain conditions. Instead of copying the elements, use references or iterators to access the elements directly.

9. Use `emplace` instead of `insert` for set insertion: The code uses the `insert` function to insert elements into the set `G[x]` and `G[y]`. However, since the elements being inserted are already known, use the `emplace` function to construct the elements in-place, avoiding unnecessary copies or move operations.

10. Use `unordered_set` instead of `set` for faster lookup: The code uses `set<int>` to store the adjacent nodes of each node in the graph. However, since the order of the elements does not matter, use `unordered_set<int>` instead, which provides faster lookup times.

11. Avoid unnecessary reverse operation: The code uses the `reverse` function to reverse the order of elements in the `TS` vector. However, since the elements are being inserted in reverse order during DFS, there is no need to reverse the vector afterward.

12. Use `reserve` for map: The code uses a `map<int, int>` to store the mapping between nodes and their positions in the `TS` vector. Since the number of elements in the map is known in advance, use the `reserve` function to preallocate memory for the map, reducing the number of reallocations.

13. Avoid unnecessary map lookup: The code uses the `map[j] < map[i]` condition in a nested loop. However, this condition can be simplified by storing the result of the map lookup in a variable before the loop and reusing it inside the loop.

With these optimizations in mind, here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_set>
#include <map>

void solve() {
    int n, m;
    std::cin >> n >> m;

    std::vector<int> visited(n + 1, 0);
    std::vector<int> being_visited(n + 1, 0);
    std::vector<int> TS;
    std::vector<std::vector<int>> g(n + 1);
    std::vector<std::unordered_set<int>> G(n + 1);

    for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
        int t, x, y;
        std::cin >> t >> x >> y;
        if (t)
            g[x].push_back(y);
        G[x].insert(y);
        G[y].insert(x);
    }

    for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
        bool ch = true;
        if (g[i].empty() && !G[i].empty()) {
            for (auto j : G[i]) {
                ch &= (!G[j].count(i));
            }
        } else {
            ch = false;
        }
        if (ch) {
            for (auto j : G[i]) {
                g[i].push_back(j);
            }
        }
    }

    auto havecycle = [&]() {
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
            if (!visited[i]) {
                if (dfs(i, visited, being_visited, TS, g)) {
                    return true;
                }
            }
        }
        return false;
    };

    if (havecycle()) {
        std::cout << "NO" << std::endl;
        return;
    }

    std::map<int, int> node_to_position;
    TS.reserve(n);
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
        node_to_position[TS[i]] = i;
    }

    std::cout << "YES" << std::endl;
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
        for (auto j : G[i]) {
            if (node_to_position[j] < node_to_position[i])
                std::cout << j << " " << i << std::endl;
        }
    }
}

int main() {
    std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    std::cin.tie(NULL);
    std::cout.tie(NULL);

    int t = 1;
    std::cin >> t;
    for (; t--; solve())
        ;
    return 0;
}
```
