Code Analysis:
- The code begins by including various libraries, such as <bits/stdc++.h> and <ext/pb_ds/assoc_container.hpp>.
- It then defines aliases for some complex data structures, such as ordered_set and ordered_multiset, using the GNU Policy-Based Data Structures.
- The code includes several macros and defines, such as fastio, int, ld, MOD, precise, f, endl, debug, err1, err2, err3, err4, all, show, PQ, LB, UB, fr, sc, and sz.
- The main part of the code consists of a solve() function that solves a particular problem.
- The solve() function reads input, constructs a graph, checks for cycles, and generates the output.
- The main() function invokes the solve() function multiple times based on the value of variable t.

Potential Performance Bottlenecks:
1. The solve() function uses a recursive depth-first search (DFS) to check for cycles in the graph. This can be time-consuming, especially for large graphs.
2. The solve() function constructs a reverse topological sort (TS) of the graph. This involves reversing the order of the DFS traversal. It also uses a map to store the indices of the vertices in the TS. Both of these operations can be expensive, especially for large graphs.
3. The solve() function iterates over all pairs of vertices to check if there is an edge between them. This can be time-consuming for dense graphs.
4. The solve() function uses a set data structure to store the neighbors of each vertex. This can result in redundant storage and potentially slow down operations like insert and count.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Replace the use of the GNU Policy-Based Data Structures with standard C++ data structures like unordered_set and unordered_map. These should provide similar functionality with better performance.
2. Replace the recursive DFS with an iterative version using a stack. This will eliminate the overhead of function calls and speed up the cycle checking process.
3. Replace the reverse topological sort with a simple vector that stores the vertices in the order they are visited during the DFS traversal. This will eliminate the need for a map and improve memory usage.
4. Use a boolean matrix to represent the edges between vertices, instead of a set. This will reduce memory usage and improve the efficiency of checking for edge existence.
5. Instead of iterating over all pairs of vertices, iterate only over the vertices that have outgoing edges. This will reduce the number of iterations and improve performance for dense graphs.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. Remove the unnecessary includes, such as <bits/stdc++.h> and <ext/pb_ds/assoc_container.hpp>.
2. Replace the aliases for ordered_set and ordered_multiset with unordered_set and unordered_multiset, respectively.
3. Remove the unused macros and defines, such as fastio, int, ld, MOD, precise, f, endl, debug, err1, err2, err3, err4, all, show, PQ, LB, UB, fr, sc, and sz.
4. Modify the solve() function as follows:
   - Replace the vector<set<int>> G with a vector<vector<bool>> edges to represent the adjacency matrix.
   - Replace the recursive dfs() function with an iterative version using a stack.
   - Replace the map<int, int> map with a vector<int> TS to store the vertices in reverse topological order.
   - Replace the for loop that checks for edges with a single loop that iterates only over vertices with outgoing edges.
   - Remove the unnecessary reverse(all(TS)) operation.
5. Modify the main() function as follows:
   - Remove the unused variable t.
