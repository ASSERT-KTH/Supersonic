The given code seems to be a solution to a graph problem. Let's analyze the code and identify potential performance bottlenecks and areas for optimization:

1. The code includes several unnecessary includes, such as `<bits/stdc++.h>` and `<ext/pb_ds/assoc_container.hpp>`. These unnecessary includes should be removed to reduce compilation time and improve code readability.

2. The code uses a lot of macros for convenience, but this can make the code harder to read and understand. It is recommended to replace macros with proper functions or constants.

3. The code defines two type aliases, `ordered_set` and `ordered_multiset`, but they are not used anywhere in the code. These aliases should either be used or removed.

4. The code uses a recursive depth-first search (DFS) algorithm to check for cycles in the graph. Recursive DFS can lead to stack overflow for large graphs. It is recommended to replace the recursive DFS with an iterative DFS or an optimized version of the recursive DFS that uses an explicit stack.

5. The code uses a `map<int, int>` named `map` to map nodes to their positions in the topological sort. However, using a `vector<int>` instead of `map<int, int>` would be more efficient because the keys are consecutive integers. This change would reduce memory consumption and improve cache locality.

6. The code uses a `set<int>` to store the neighbors of each node in the graph. However, using a `vector<int>` instead of `set<int>` would be more efficient because the order of the neighbors does not matter. This change would reduce memory consumption and improve cache locality.

7. The code uses `cout` and `endl` for output, which can be slow due to the synchronization with the C standard I/O library. It is recommended to use `printf` for faster output.

Based on these observations, here is the proposed optimization strategy:

1. Remove unnecessary includes to improve code readability and reduce compilation time.

2. Replace macros with proper functions or constants to improve code readability.

3. Remove the unused type aliases `ordered_set` and `ordered_multiset`.

4. Replace the recursive DFS algorithm with an iterative DFS or an optimized version of the recursive DFS that uses an explicit stack to avoid stack overflow.

5. Replace the `map<int, int>` with a `vector<int>` to improve memory consumption and cache locality.

6. Replace the `set<int>` with a `vector<int>` to improve memory consumption and cache locality.

7. Replace `cout` and `endl` with `printf` for faster output.

Let's now implement these optimizations step by step:
