This code is a C++ program that solves a graph problem. It takes input in the form of the number of nodes `n` and the number of edges `m`, followed by `m` edges. The program checks if the graph contains a cycle and if not, it prints the edges in the reverse topological order.

Upon analyzing the code, here are some potential areas for optimization:

1. Unnecessary includes: The code includes unnecessary headers like `<bits/stdc++.h>` and `<ext/pb_ds/assoc_container.hpp>`. We can remove these includes to improve compilation time.

2. Macros: The code uses macros extensively for common operations like `cout`, `endl`, and loops. While macros can be convenient, they can also lead to code bloat and can be harder to debug. We can replace these macros with standard C++ constructs to improve code readability and maintainability.

3. Redundant data structures: The code uses both a vector of vectors (`g`) and a vector of sets (`G`) to represent the graph. This duplication of data structures can lead to unnecessary memory usage and slower performance. We can simplify the code by using only one data structure to represent the graph.

4. Inefficient algorithms: The code uses a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm to check for cycles in the graph. However, this can be optimized further by using a more efficient algorithm like Tarjan's algorithm for strongly connected components.

5. Inefficient loop operations: The code uses nested loops to iterate over the elements of the graph. We can optimize these loops by using more efficient algorithms or data structures that provide faster lookup and insertion times.

Based on these observations, here is an optimization strategy:

1. Remove unnecessary includes: Remove the unnecessary includes `<bits/stdc++.h>` and `<ext/pb_ds/assoc_container.hpp>`.

2. Replace macros: Replace the macros with standard C++ constructs like `std::cout`, `std::endl`, and range-based for loops.

3. Simplify data structures: Remove the vector of sets (`G`) and modify the code to use only the vector of vectors (`g`) to represent the graph.

4. Optimize cycle detection: Replace the DFS algorithm with a more efficient algorithm like Tarjan's algorithm to check for cycles in the graph.

5. Optimize loop operations: Replace nested loops with more efficient algorithms or data structures.

Now, let's optimize the code step by step.
