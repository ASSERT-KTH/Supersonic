Code Analysis:

1. The code includes several unnecessary header files (`<bits/stdc++.h>`, `<ext/pb_ds/assoc_container.hpp>`, `<ext/pb_ds/tree_policy.hpp>`) that are not used in the program. These should be removed to improve compile time.

2. The code uses a lot of macros (`#define`) for commonly used constructs such as `fastio`, `int`, `debug`, etc. While macros can provide convenience, they can also make the code harder to read and understand. It would be better to replace these macros with regular function calls or variables.

3. The code uses a `vector<vector<int>>` to represent a graph. However, this data structure is not efficient for sparse graphs, as it requires a lot of memory. It would be better to use a more efficient data structure such as an adjacency list or an adjacency matrix.

4. The code uses a recursive depth-first search (DFS) algorithm to detect cycles in the graph. While this algorithm is correct, it may not be efficient for large graphs with many edges. It would be better to use an iterative depth-first search or an algorithm such as Tarjan's algorithm for cycle detection.

5. The code uses a `map<int, int>` to store the mapping between nodes and their positions in the topological sort. However, this data structure is not necessary, as the position of each node can be determined directly from the `TS` vector.

Optimization Strategy:

1. Remove unnecessary header files: Remove the unnecessary header files `<bits/stdc++.h>`, `<ext/pb_ds/assoc_container.hpp>`, `<ext/pb_ds/tree_policy.hpp>`.

2. Replace macros with regular function calls or variables: Replace the macros `fastio`, `int`, `debug`, etc. with regular function calls or variables.

3. Optimize the graph representation: Replace the `vector<vector<int>>` representation of the graph with a more efficient data structure such as an adjacency list or an adjacency matrix.

4. Replace recursive DFS with an iterative DFS or Tarjan's algorithm: Replace the recursive DFS algorithm with an iterative DFS algorithm or Tarjan's algorithm for cycle detection.

5. Remove the unnecessary `map<int, int>` data structure: Remove the `map<int, int>` data structure and calculate the position of each node directly from the `TS` vector.

Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. Remove unnecessary header files: Remove the unnecessary header files `<bits/stdc++.h>`, `<ext/pb_ds/assoc_container.hpp>`, `<ext/pb_ds/tree_policy.hpp>`. These header files are not used in the program and can be safely removed.

2. Replace macros with regular function calls or variables: Replace the macros `fastio`, `int`, `debug`, etc. with regular function calls or variables. For example, replace `fastio` with `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); cin.tie(NULL); cout.tie(NULL);`, replace `int` with `long long`, and replace `debug` with `cout << "\n========================================\n";`.

3. Optimize the graph representation: Replace the `vector<vector<int>>` representation of the graph with a more efficient data structure such as an adjacency list or an adjacency matrix. This will reduce memory usage and improve performance, especially for sparse graphs.

4. Replace recursive DFS with an iterative DFS or Tarjan's algorithm: Replace the recursive DFS algorithm with an iterative DFS algorithm or Tarjan's algorithm for cycle detection. This will improve the performance of the cycle detection algorithm, especially for large graphs with many edges.

5. Remove the unnecessary `map<int, int>` data structure: Remove the `map<int, int>` data structure and calculate the position of each node directly from the `TS` vector. This will reduce memory usage and improve performance.

The optimized code has removed unnecessary header files, replaced macros with regular function calls or variables, optimized the graph representation, replaced the recursive DFS with an iterative DFS, and removed the unnecessary `map<int, int>` data structure. The changes aim to improve the code's efficiency, reduce memory usage, and maintain the functionality and output of the original code.
