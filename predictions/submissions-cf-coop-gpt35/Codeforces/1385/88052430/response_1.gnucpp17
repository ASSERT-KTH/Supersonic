The given code appears to be a program that solves a graph problem. 

Upon analyzing the code, we can identify several areas where optimizations can be made:

1. Unnecessary includes: The code includes some unnecessary headers, such as `bits/stdc++.h` and headers from the `pb_ds` library. These headers can be removed to improve compilation time.

2. Excessive use of macros: The code contains numerous macros, such as `fastio`, `debug`, and `err`. While macros can be useful for code readability, excessive use can make the code harder to understand and maintain. We should consider removing or minimizing the use of macros.

3. Inefficient data structures: The code uses a vector of sets (`vector<set<int>>`) to represent the graph. This data structure is not optimal for graph operations, such as checking for cycles or finding adjacent nodes. We should consider using a more efficient data structure, such as an adjacency list.

4. Redundant graph construction: The code constructs two versions of the graph: `g` and `G`. The construction of `g` is redundant, as it is only used to check for cycles. We can eliminate the construction of `g` and modify the cycle detection algorithm to work directly with `G`.

5. Inefficient graph traversal: The code uses a recursive depth-first search (DFS) algorithm to detect cycles and perform topological sorting. Recursive DFS can be inefficient for large graphs due to its recursive nature. We should consider using an iterative DFS algorithm or an alternative algorithm, such as Tarjan's algorithm, to improve performance.

6. Inefficient cycle detection: The current cycle detection algorithm uses a separate `being_visited` array to track nodes being visited during DFS. This additional array adds unnecessary memory overhead. We can eliminate this array by modifying the DFS algorithm to check for a back edge directly in the `visited` array.

7. Inefficient topological sorting: The current topological sorting algorithm reverses the order of visited nodes using the `reverse` function. This operation has a time complexity of O(n), which can be avoided by directly inserting nodes at the beginning of the result vector.

8. Inefficient mapping: The code uses a `map` to map nodes to their corresponding indices in the topological sorting order. However, a `map` has a logarithmic time complexity for insertion and lookup. We can replace it with a `vector` to improve performance.

Based on these observations, we can formulate an optimization plan as follows:

1. Remove unnecessary includes.
2. Minimize the use of macros.
3. Replace `vector<set<int>>` with an adjacency list representation for the graph.
4. Modify the cycle detection algorithm to work directly with the adjacency list.
5. Replace the recursive DFS with an iterative DFS algorithm.
6. Improve the topological sorting algorithm to avoid the use of `reverse`.
7. Replace the `map` with a `vector` for mapping nodes to indices.
