The provided code is a C++ program that solves a graph problem. It takes as input the number of nodes `n`, the number of queries `m`, and a list of edges representing the graph. The program then performs a series of operations based on the queries.

Upon analyzing the code, we can identify several potential areas for optimization:

1. Redundant Memory Usage: The code uses multiple data structures to represent the graph, such as sets and arrays. This could lead to redundant memory usage and slow down the program.

2. Inefficient Data Structures: The code uses a set to store the edges of each node. However, a set is not the most efficient data structure for this purpose, as it requires O(log n) time complexity for insertions and deletions. 

3. Inefficient Graph Traversal: The code uses recursive depth-first search (DFS) to traverse the graph and perform calculations. Recursive DFS can be inefficient and can lead to stack overflow errors for large graphs.

4. Unnecessary Computations: The code performs redundant computations, such as calculating the distance between nodes multiple times.

5. Lack of Compiler Optimizations: The code does not utilize any compiler optimizations, such as loop unrolling or pragma directives, to improve performance.

Based on these observations, we can formulate an optimization strategy to improve the code's efficiency:

1. Replace the sets used to represent the edges of each node with a more efficient data structure, such as an adjacency list or a vector of vectors. This will reduce memory usage and improve performance.

2. Replace the recursive DFS with an iterative implementation, such as a stack-based DFS or a breadth-first search (BFS). This will avoid stack overflow errors and improve traversal speed.

3. Avoid redundant computations by storing the results of calculations in variables or data structures, rather than recalculating them multiple times.

4. Utilize compiler optimizations, such as loop unrolling or pragma directives, to hint the compiler to optimize certain parts of the code.
